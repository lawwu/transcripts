[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer of
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.040]   2019 I used to spend a lot of summers working harder or
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.900]   Writing more because I wanted to prepare for the inevitable boomerang or slingshot in the third quarter and fourth quarter
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.640]   But now as I get older, I'm taking my time more
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.860]   I'm slowing down and kind of smelling the roses and we plan to spend end of July or early August in Hawaii
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.480]   To test drive whether we'd like to live in Hawaii, especially during the hottest summer months
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.120]   So this episode it really is about more reflection
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.960]   It's about what I would do differently if I could retire all over again
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.480]   So I've been writing about early retirement since 2009
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.280]   The first three years of Financial Samurai was me mainly trying to figure out how to retire early
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.680]   How to do so in a comfortable manner where I wouldn't regret it and then the subsequent
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.500]   Seven plus years has been me touching upon various aspects of post retirement life
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.680]   And for the most part early retirement has been everything I hoped for
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.400]   Freedom truly truly is priceless
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.500]   But I've also highlighted a lot of negatives about early retirement that I could not have expected
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.520]   Until living as an early retiree for several years
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.000]   We can really pontificate all we want about what it's like to do something or be in a particular scenario
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.840]   But until you experience it for yourself, there's no amount of planning that can prepare you for some of life's biggest moments
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.600]   And one thing I'm thinking about in particular is how difficult it is being a stay-at-home parent
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.380]   It's joyous for sure, but unless you're a stay-at-home parent or unless you have kids
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.960]   Man, it is so hard to keep your wits about you
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   So now that I'm deep into early retirement
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.200]   I like to share what I do differently if I could rewind time and go back to when I first left work in
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.880]   2012 and there are basically five five things I would do differently or do a little bit better
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.160]   So one I would have worked for at least one more year in
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.520]   2013 I wrote about the trap of the quote one more year syndrome
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.080]   Where people can't leave their jobs due to the money and security provides
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560]   It's always one more year to see if you can get a promotion or one more year
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.840]   one more bonus to feel more secure financially that locks people in and then 10 15 20 years of one more year later and
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   People wonder where all their time went. So I left work at 34 years old now that I'm 42 years old
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   I look back and think how
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.200]   Absurdly young that was to retire leaving a good job at that age now seems irresponsible and reckless
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.160]   I left because I was sick of office politics. I was bored with my job and wanted to do something new
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.320]   These reasons now all sound like I was an entitled
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.840]   Impatient brat and I probably would have told myself
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.800]   My younger self to suck it up already if my son was thinking about this at the age of 33
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   I would definitely tell him to suck it up because 34
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.440]   That just seems it just seems way too young
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.720]   But in my defense I had been with the firm for 10 years 10 consecutive long years before I thought about
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.200]   Getting out so it ended up being 11 consecutive years with that firm
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.240]   So if I had stayed for one more year, it would have given me more time to prepare for my post work future
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.920]   I would have lived like a pauper for my final year and saved another
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.640]   $100,000 plus for retirement on my firm's dime
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.800]   I would have gone on more international business trips. I would have taken out for lunch or drinks all my colleagues
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.520]   Competitors and clients I had gotten to know over my 13 years in the business and generally savor
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.040]   Savor my final year at work instead. I now feel like I rushed my departure. I only came up with the concept of
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.640]   negotiating a severance in November of 2011 five months before I ultimately did and you know what the first
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.880]   Three months of the concept after coming up with the concept was just filled with a lot of uncertainty
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.120]   Therefore I did make some mistakes like taking a week of vacation the year I left
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.460]   I also almost lost all my corporate card points because I shut it off before redeeming them
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.800]   But ultimately I got them back. Whoo, if I had stayed for at least one more year
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.040]   I also would have aggressively tried to find a new role within the firm in a different office
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.160]   You know, that's kind of like a new adventure changing jobs
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.040]   But with the same firm and having all your credits and goodwill that you've built along the way it is
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.480]   Always it has always been a dream of mine to work overseas since I grew up overseas for the first 13 years of my life
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.180]   If I had been able to find a new job within the firm in Hong Kong
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.240]   Taiwan Beijing or London
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.680]   I think my interest in work would have been rejuvenated and I could have worked for at least another three years
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   I was thinking about it and a new country new city new friends new activities new culture new food
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.880]   It would have been awesome to just relocate to another country and I have an expat package
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.120]   Where you know, you get maybe subsidized housing and then the first I think
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.760]   $96,000 you earn is
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.840]   Tax-free not bad. If you already know you're gonna leave a job and negotiate a severance
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   Let's say a year from now your work life could become much much less stressful and much more interesting
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.080]   Think back to when you're in high school or college
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.760]   When you knew where you were going to college or going for work by leaving so quickly I fail to uncover more opportunities
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.400]   So today I encourage folks to try to get it out until age 40 or for at least one more year
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.480]   than originally planned if you're burning out take a sabbatical or
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.200]   Multiple extended two-week vacations to recharge use up all your vacation days, please
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.800]   Please if you are feeling burnt out, but on the flip side don't use your vacation
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.360]   days if you absolutely know you want to leave work because
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.580]   Vacation days are worth a daily pay rate
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.280]   So if you wait until age 40 or for at least one more year than you think you want to leave
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.600]   not only will your finances be stronger, but you'll also be able to eliminate more completely any potential work regret and
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.120]   Maximize your chances of never returning
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   Over the years I've seen plenty of idealistic young fire dreamers truncate their careers
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.980]   Probably because of fire FOMO only to realize they had made a big mistake and when they tried to get back to work
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.920]   they had a hard time getting the same job with similar pay and
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.840]   You know, they felt a lot of I think stress and anxiety and sometimes ridiculed by others for you know
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.580]   Quote retiring at the age of 28 or 30 or whatever again
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.800]   It just seems so ridiculous to try to retire in your 20s or early 30s when life
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.060]   There's just like so much more you could do at work and in life and it's not just an NLBL and life
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.160]   Does seem kind of long in retrospect?
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.840]   The second thing I would have done differently was try to have children while working. One of my regrets was waiting until
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   Age 37 or three years after I left work to try
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.900]   Seriously having children my wife was 34 at the time and had just negotiated her severance
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.620]   We waited so long mainly because I was overly focused on my career
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.700]   I didn't think I was mentally ready to be a dad without first having an enormous financial buffer
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.520]   So when I was in college and also after working for a couple years, I was thinking myself
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.400]   I I think I need like a million dollars to raise a kid in Manhattan or in San Francisco
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.900]   And so logically I felt that having children would delay my permanent escape from work
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.360]   Friends kept telling me once their children were born. They felt they had a responsibility
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.180]   To work until they graduated college
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.700]   So working for another 21 to 23 more years sounded like a prison sentence
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.720]   Therefore I decided to avoid prison altogether and selfishly focus on me
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.480]   but
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.120]   If I could do it over again
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:27.240]   I would have tried to have kids in my early 30s rather than at 39 years old because sometimes
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.520]   Not everything goes according to plan. I mean you can't just say hey, I want to have a kid on
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.400]   August
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.740]   15th at 10 p.m. No, it just doesn't work that way, right?
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.400]   Normal couples take seven to eight tries to get pregnant and then you know
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.040]   Staying pregnant is another issue. So
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.880]   Prayers to all those on board kids who never made it and my heart goes out to all the parents out there as well
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.720]   Life is truly truly precious
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.360]   And as I look back, I would have ideally liked to have my first at age 33
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   Have another little one by age 36 and like my job enough to retire at age 40 after 19 years with the firm
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   I think a couple things
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.880]   Would have happened one
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.720]   I would have better appreciated work and all its benefits more if I had kid while I was working and
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.680]   Then I know I would have probably started resenting work for keeping
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.280]   You know me away from my kid
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.680]   After about one or two years, so then I would have appreciated
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.360]   early retirement more after
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.080]   Let's say negotiating a severance at least one year after my son was born
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.960]   So these you know, there are definitely some positives and negatives
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.000]   To having kids while working a stressful job
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But I think these are some positives that would have happened if I did three I
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   Would have worked on my side hustles sooner and more aggressively
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.840]   I've mentioned this before and I just want to encourage everyone to work on something
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.920]   Outside of work time because you never know what will happen, you know
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.880]   The key I think to maintaining a steady state of happiness is being able to consistently forecast your potential misery
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.520]   And taking steps beforehand to counteract that misery and ideally we can all consistently plan three to five years ahead
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.760]   But it's not a natural act right just like going to lift weights is not a natural act
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:29.160]   You've got to regularly work on it. It wasn't until the stock market melted down in 2008 and 2009
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.240]   When I started seriously forecasting my misery on a regular basis and before then I was just too lazy
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.440]   You know, it's too lazy to think about a side hustle because things were pretty much going well, right?
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.400]   I had got a new job in 2001. I moved out to San Francisco
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:53.240]   I got into business school part-time and my career and my pay was going up up up until the financial crisis
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.400]   If I had started financial samurai in 2006 when I first came up with the idea
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:05.440]   Perhaps I would have felt much more settled than I did when I left work in 2012 with more financial certainty
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.640]   More confidence and a clear purpose. I may have had the guts to try having children three years sooner as well
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:19.960]   But the desire for money and the necessity to live in an expensive city like San Francisco in New York for this money
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:26.800]   Got to me and I just realized man. I had to really grind it out and be financially stable
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.200]   To be a responsible parent. I mean, I don't know why I felt I needed to be so responsible before having children
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:41.040]   But I did and some of you might think I'm being too hard on myself for not foreseeing the recession and starting to work on
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.600]   my side hustle sooner
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.200]   But ever since I started working in the finance industry in 1999
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.640]   I've always felt that my years were numbered because of the company long hours and great stress. All right for I
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.520]   Should have bought more real estate in 2012 real estate is my absolute favorite asset class to build wealth
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   Especially since I've seen real estate do so well in places like New York City in San Francisco for the past 20 years where I've lived
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.760]   and worked
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   But I was too focused on engineering my layoff in 2012
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   The last thing on my mind was leveraging up to buy more property
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:21.400]   In fact, I try to sell my primary residence in 2012, but couldn't find a buyer. Thank goodness
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.440]   you know I was trying to sell and then just downgrade to a two-bedroom one-bath rental and
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.800]   Really live frugally my first year post early retirement, you know, I just didn't want to you know
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.360]   Mess things up and come back with it my tail between my legs and say please give me a job again
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.800]   So if I had planned on working until let's say age 40 or five and a half six more years
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   I would have had greater confidence to buy at the bottom of the existing cycle
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.040]   2012 literally was right before everything started going
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:58.240]   crazy in San Francisco real estate and in real estate across the country a
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.760]   900,000 rental property I would have bought in 2012 would be now worth about 1.6 million today
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.400]   So that lost seven hundred thousand dollars in gross gains
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.480]   hmm, that's that could pay for
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.080]   College tuition private school for two kids, I would think
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.440]   Hmm. So my failure to buy in 2012
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.640]   That really kind of is painful when I really think about it and I really do the math
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:36.560]   But at least I did buy a fixer-upper in 2014 and I continued to contribute to my tax advantageous
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.840]   Retirement accounts. It's all better than nothing
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:46.640]   All right fifth and finally I didn't fully capitalize on my position as an early retiree
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.720]   So the fire movement is very very hot right now
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:58.000]   and you can't go a week without some major media publication talking about retiring early and
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.480]   Although I've been writing about early retirement since 2009
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.880]   Financial samurai is often left out of the mainstream fire conversation because I write about so many topics in addition to early retirement
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.080]   I'm more focused on wealth maximization through equity investing
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.640]   Entrepreneurship career strategies and real estate my favorite asset class
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:27.920]   Over the past couple of years. I've discovered new joy talking about family finances and estate planning
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.720]   So I'm basically writing about my journey and the things that interest me as I involve
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.560]   Becoming a father and becoming older and so forth once I retired early
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.800]   I felt like there was no need to talk incessantly about early retirement
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.940]   Instead I just got on with my life because my goal of financial independence had been met
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.840]   Further I didn't want to rub it in people's faces that I was done with work
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.080]   You know offline after a year of telling folks who asked what I did that I was retired
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.760]   I started changing my response so that I wouldn't feel as stupid and guilty
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.200]   I changed my response to say that I was a writer or a tennis coach
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.920]   Just to feel more comfortable
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:16.040]   You know, it just it just didn't feel right and sit right with me to say hey look at my amazing life here in wherever
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:24.760]   Amsterdam because we are retired early and then just taking selfies and pictures or that just obnoxious photo of your
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.200]   toes
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.800]   Dipping into the sand on the beach somewhere and just saying look at my wonderful life
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.680]   I'm not like that and I don't do that on social media
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.720]   And I certainly don't want to do that regularly on my site if at all, you know
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.260]   Maybe once a year something like that, but not every week every month saying hey, this is early retirement early retirement
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.280]   Ha ha ha ha right. It just felt unseemly. I
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.800]   also naively believed
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:59.800]   More people would give finance samurai credit for being one of the pioneers of the modern-day fire movement. I mean 2009
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.640]   Not many people
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.800]   Were talking about retiring early online
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.160]   But just like at work those who self-promote the loudest tend to get the most attention
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.520]   And while those who stay silent and believe their good work will get them
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.360]   Recognized usually get left behind
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.360]   So in retrospect if I was a little bit more self-promotional a little bit more
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.640]   Proactive and a little less naive. I think I would have grown financial samurai
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.400]   faster and larger and I would have done better at branding the site as
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.120]   Now we're so focused on early retirement lifestyle in the personal finance
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.600]   blogosphere and in the media
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.900]   But I do think there is opportunity because half the US population lives in the expensive coasts, right?
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.920]   San Francisco, New York, Boston
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.400]   LA San Diego, and I don't know many if any early retirement bloggers
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.200]   Living off investment income in these areas as a result
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:09.240]   I feel like I'm often left on an island without a tribe of people to converse with in a similar situation
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:16.960]   But at the same time that is an opportunity to help represent and talk about issues that afflict half the population
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.120]   And as a father now with rising cost to cover and a full-time mom for a spouse
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.720]   I need to focus more on monetizing this site going forward
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.240]   I've been way too
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:34.400]   Lackadaisical about generating revenue due to our sufficient retirement income and my desire to only write about things that interest me
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.000]   So going forward the next I don't know three to five to ten years if I'm able to hold on to financial samurai for this
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.520]   Long I'm really gonna focus on the monetization aspect whether it's writing new books
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.000]   doing courses
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.560]   building more affiliate partnerships and so forth
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:57.440]   because I see opportunity and I think it's the responsible thing to do to make enough money for your family and
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.000]   Be a solid stable provider
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.560]   So in conclusion, I encourage all of us to live in the present and consistently plan for the future
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.040]   It's worth being patient. It's worth being
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:17.960]   Methodical in your planning because you want to do it right the first time and you want to minimize mistakes and regret
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:25.640]   So hopefully my five mistakes can help you better plan for the future and the way I'm gonna rectify my mistakes is
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.000]   To one live as long and as healthy a life as possible if I can do that
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.440]   Beyond what I was supposed to live, you know
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.520]   I think that would mitigate a lot of these mistakes too, but I'll never know for sure whether I made a difference in my longevity
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.360]   or not and
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:49.000]   The other thing to do is to just really appreciate the moment that you have that I have, you know
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.920]   I just can't rewind and change the past so I've got to continue to focus on the present and the future
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.200]   The older you get the more you will feel the race against time
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:06.040]   The good thing is that money and status gradually fade away in your personal hierarchy of importance
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.240]   Desiring to spend more time with family and enjoying more free time is a natural part of life
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.860]   So if you're thinking about retiring early, please ask yourself the following questions
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.520]   Why am I rushing to retire early?
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.200]   Am I running away from something?
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.120]   What will I do after I retire early? Am I running towards something? This is really important difference folks
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.760]   How will retiring early change my life for the better or worse?
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.880]   Am I sacrificing too much to retire so early?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.160]   Would one more year or maybe five more years be more beneficial?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.600]   Have I gained enough perspective from those who've already retired?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.440]   And so hopefully by listening to this podcast you gain more perspective
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.120]   It'll help you in your decision when it comes to retiring. There are no perfect answers nor is there perfect timing?
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.600]   You can only do your best with information, you know at the time
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.720]   It's only after several years of living an early retirement lifestyle
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:11.320]   That you will know what you could have done differently or better to make it an even more wonderful retirement
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   So stay optimistic live in the present and consistently spend time planning for the future
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.600]   Chances are really high. You'll live to see another amazing day
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.280]   Thanks so much folks
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:28.920]   And I'd love to hear from all of you on what you would do differently or what are some of your takeaways from this podcast?
