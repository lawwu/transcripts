[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   We come this evening to a consideration of the third verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:18.320]   epistle to the Romans. "Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   were baptized into his death?" Let me remind you of the first two verses also. What shall
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:34.520]   we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.920]   being what we are, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? "Know ye not that so many
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.600]   of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?" Now this verse,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.320]   as I was indicating last week, commences the exposition which the great apostle gives us
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.440]   of that staggering and tremendous statement which he makes in verse 2 and which we were
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:18.880]   considering together last week. Here is the fundamental proposition, that we died to sin.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.480]   That is his ultimate refutation of this monstrous suggestion that his doctrine should lead anybody
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.600]   to say, "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?" The thing is ridiculous. It's
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.960]   sheer impossibility because we died to sin. Now we worked that out and showed something
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:53.680]   of the content of that tremendous statement. But people may still say, "Well now, how did
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:03.280]   we die to sin? How is it true to say of us that we died to sin?" The apostle now, in
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.840]   verses 3 to 11, proceeds to answer that question. Of course, he's already thrown out a hint
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.400]   with regard to the answer way back in chapter 5 at the end of verse 10. That is why we emphasize
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.000]   that so much at the time. "For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.960]   the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved in his life." It should
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.280]   be in his life rather than by his life. In a sense it comes to the same thing. But if
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.320]   you do take it as in his life, you have, as we indicated there, the first hint of this
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.080]   tremendous doctrine, which he's now going to elaborate here. And of course, in verses
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.560]   12 to 21 of chapter 5, the whole thing is implicit. Because there again we saw that
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.160]   his whole comparison is this. We were in Adam, we are now in Christ. He doesn't say it explicitly,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.920]   but it's implicit in the whole argument. Well now, he's taking that up. And he has put it
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.360]   in this practical way to answer this objector by saying, "We died to sin." Well, how did
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:31.400]   we die to sin? And his answer is this. It is this doctrine of our union with Christ.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.800]   That is the doctrine which he expounds and explains in detail, particularly from this
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.560]   third verse to verse 11, where he winds up his argument in the form of an exhortation,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   which is a logical deduction from what he's been saying. We shall find that he states
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.720]   it negatively and positively, according to his custom.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.680]   Well now then, here is the doctrine that's before us. The doctrine of our union with
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:10.240]   Christ. Once more, we must say that it is one of the most glorious aspects of the Christian
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.920]   truth, one of the most profound, one of the most stimulating, one of the most comforting.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   Indeed, I'd rather like to choose the word, one of the most exhilarating, with the full
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:33.200]   content of that word, exhilarating. I say that there is nothing, perhaps, in the whole
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.880]   range and realm of doctrine which, if properly grasped and understood, gives greater assurance,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   greater comfort, and greater hope than this doctrine of our union with Christ. But indeed,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.240]   as we shall see, if we are not clear about this doctrine, we are missing, in a sense,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.440]   what is one of the pivotal aspects of the whole doctrine of salvation.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.400]   Very well, then, we must pay very careful attention to this. And it was in order that
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.080]   people might be perfectly clear about it, undoubtedly, that the apostle elaborates it
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.240]   in this way. Well now, unfortunately, there are many who have never really grasped this
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.800]   doctrine. They don't seem to realize that it's there. People who have read this sixth
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.880]   chapter of Romans many times never seem to have seen it. And I think there is one very
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.160]   big explanation of that, and it is the one with which we've got to deal this evening.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   It seems to me that so many have missed this doctrine at this point, because they've been
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:51.440]   diverted from the doctrine by the form of expression in which the apostle presents it.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:59.040]   I mean by that that they've seen the word "baptized" in these verses, in verses three
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.400]   and four. And having once seen the word "baptized," they never see anything else. And they think
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.200]   that these verses really have nothing to teach except a particular doctrine of baptism.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.320]   Now, I think this is tragic. And because it is, we really must, perforce, go into this
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:25.000]   matter. I would choose not to do so. But after all, the business of a man who sets up as
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.720]   a teacher is not to do what he wants to do, nor what pleases him. It is indeed to help
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:38.400]   those who listen to his teaching. And as this matter has been so frequently misunderstood
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.040]   and misinterpreted, and in a way, as I say, which has robbed people of the glorious doctrine
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.440]   that's here, well, we really must rid our minds of any misconceptions or preconceptions
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   which thus have spoiled us of so great a prize.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.480]   In other words, what I'm saying is this, that the best way to understand the doctrine,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.840]   therefore, is to get ourselves clearer as to the whole meaning of this term "baptized,"
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.600]   as used in this third verse, and again in the fourth verse, where we read, "Therefore
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.840]   we were buried with him by baptism into death, that like us Christ was raised up from the
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.560]   dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.080]   Very well, let's look at it. How has this term been interpreted? Well, here are some
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.520]   of the common ways in which people have interpreted it. First of all, there is the sacramental
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:46.760]   or the sacramentarian interpretation of this, which simply teaches quite openly and plainly
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:55.560]   that it is the actual act or rite or performance of baptism that incorporates us into Christ
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.520]   and makes us joined to him. That is, if you like, in a sense, the doctrine of baptismal
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:10.360]   regeneration. It is the way in which this doctrine is taught by Catholics with various
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:17.600]   prefixes, Roman, Anglican, Scottish, and many others. It doesn't matter which form of Catholicism,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   that is their teaching. It is the actual act of baptizing that unites the person baptized
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:33.440]   into the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a perfectly clear cut and obvious view.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.480]   But now, is this the explanation of these verses? Well, I don't think we need to spend
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:48.960]   much time this evening on that in this congregation. But surely, the one overriding reason why it
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:56.240]   can be dismissed at once is this, that according to the New Testament teaching, it clearly,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.200]   if I may use such an expression, puts the cart before the horse. The teaching of the
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.080]   New Testament is that the people who are to be baptized are those who have already given
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:15.440]   evidence that they are regenerate. It is believers who are baptized in the New Testament. So
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.080]   it isn't the act of baptism that makes them believers. It is because they are believers,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.440]   or are presumed to be believers, that they are baptized. Think, for instance, of what
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.880]   happened to the Ethiopian eunuch. It was because he was believed that Philip baptized him.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.840]   Take the case of Cornelius. "Who was I," says Peter, "that I could withhold water and baptize
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.680]   him and his household, when I saw that the gift of the Spirit had been given to them
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.560]   as unto us at the beginning?" You see the order. It was the same with the Philippian
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:57.080]   jailer. It was when he had believed that he was baptized, he and all his household, we
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.280]   are told, believed, and he and his household, therefore, were baptized.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.840]   Now, this of course is a tremendous argument. It's our whole attitude as Protestants against
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:14.080]   that whole Catholic doctrine, which teaches that grace is transmitted by the very elements.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.640]   They believe that grace is transmitted in the water, as they believe grace is transmitted
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.360]   by the wafer that is eaten at the Lord's Supper, that it conveys grace and the actual
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.320]   body of Christ. Well, now then, there it seems to me is the answer to this. In other words,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   we can base it on this, and it's in and of itself sufficient.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:46.680]   The cases given in the New Testament itself clearly show that far from giving life and
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:54.000]   union, baptism is rather meant to be something that seals that, or is given as an attestation
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.680]   or a seal of that. That's the order, not the other way around. Of course, this crept
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.760]   in partly as a misinterpretation of these verses. Let's never forget that. The sacramentarians
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.400]   always go to these verses for their doctrine of baptism and doctrine of sacraments. And
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:17.120]   of course, it led in turn to an exaltation of the priesthood and of the church. And so,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.400]   the tyranny comes in that dominates the life of the individual. Now, Protestantism is a
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.760]   protest against all that by asserting the universal priesthood of all believers, and
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:36.040]   asserting particularly that no action on behalf of the church can give life or can produce
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.800]   this union. I leave it at that. Others, of course, rejecting all that, say that what
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:52.040]   is taught here is that this baptism here referred to means our baptismal vows. Oh no, it isn't
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.320]   anything a priest or a minister does. They say, "You're right, that's nonsense."
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.480]   Well, what is this baptism? "Oh, well," they say, "this is the occasion on which
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:10.800]   we take certain baptismal vows. We declare our faith, we repudiate the life of sin, and
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:18.600]   at the same time, therefore, this is the occasion when we are pledging ourselves, and this puts
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:25.000]   us into the realm and the sphere of Christ." We needn't stay with this, although we cannot
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.860]   refrain from pointing out how this element of bearing testimony does very frequently
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.640]   tend to be overdone in baptismal services, as if that was the real big thing. It is the
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.920]   vow and the stand that I take. That runs contrary to the whole of the New Testament teaching
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.480]   on baptism. In a sense, by submitting to baptism, one is making a statement that that isn't
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.800]   the big thing in baptism. And in any case, it isn't the big thing here. What is being
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.680]   emphasized here is not anything that I do as a believer. It is what has happened to
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:07.340]   me that incorporates me into Christ and joins me to Christ. The doctrine is the doctrine
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:14.280]   of my union with Christ, not something that I may do or not do.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:21.560]   Well, there is a second view. Then others say that it means this, that this baptism
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.560]   means that we are baptized into the sphere of Christ's influence. Now, there is something
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.320]   to be said for this, because there is a parallel which we find in the first epistle to the
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:40.880]   Corinthians, chapter 10. Let me read to you the first two verses. 1 Corinthians 10. "Moreover,
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.080]   brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:55.200]   and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:03.960]   sea." You notice that they were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea. Here
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.680]   is a warning, of course, to all people who tend to argue like this. The word "baptized"
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.520]   means "baptized," and it means nothing but baptized. Very well, these people were
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.280]   baptized unto Moses—don't forget that—in the sea as they were passing through the Red
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.080]   Sea. Well, now, there it obviously does mean that they were baptized not only under his
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:30.120]   influence but under his leadership. They were the people who were under the leadership of
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.560]   Moses whom God had appointed, and in that indirect sense, through Moses, they were the
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:44.760]   people of God. But here in this sixth chapter, the whole context, I say again, makes that
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.120]   explanation quite impossible. Because what is taught here is not that we have come under
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.200]   the influence of Christ or into the sphere of his influence—it does teach that, but
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.800]   it goes well beyond that. We are united to Christ. We are in Christ. We are parts of
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   Christ. As we were in Adam, we are in Christ. Not merely influence, but a union, a spiritual
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.200]   union. So that that explanation, I suggest again, is inadequate.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:24.920]   So we come to the fourth prophet explanation, which says that what baptism means is that
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:35.520]   we are baptized and it is a sign of our belief in the redeeming and saving efficacy of the
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:44.600]   death of Christ as a propitiation for our sins. Now, I believe that water baptism does
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:51.520]   that and that that is the main thing that it does do. And yet, once more, surely we
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.120]   must see that this does not stop at that. That is why we had to reject Robert Holden's
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.560]   exposition of verse 2 last week. He confines it to the saving efficacy in that way, particularly
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:10.440]   the death, the propitiation. We believe that, yes, but here is a doctrine that takes us
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.720]   beyond that. It is not merely a declaration that we do believe in this and subscribe to
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:24.600]   this. Again, I say it goes beyond it because it is teaching our union with Christ. But
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:30.320]   there is a further reason why I must reject that particular exposition. Verse 4 states
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:39.240]   quite plainly, "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism," through baptism, if you like.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:47.680]   We are buried with him by or through baptism unto death. And you notice verse 5 takes it
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.960]   further and is still more explicit, "We have been planted together." And this planting
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:01.160]   means the kind of union that you have when a shoot is grafted into a parent trunk. It's
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:09.080]   a grafting, it's a union. So that to say that it is merely an indication or an attestation
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:17.300]   of our belief in the saving efficacy of Christ and the virtue of his death falls far short
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:23.840]   of the rich content of this particular section. So we have to reject that fourth explanation
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:31.200]   also. And that brings me to the fifth. The fifth is this. It says what the apostle is
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:41.720]   teaching here is this, that baptism is the symbolic representation or the pictorial enactment
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:50.120]   of a deeper spiritual reality. And they say this deeper spiritual reality is this, our
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:56.480]   union with Christ. Yes, our union with him in his death and in his burial. We go down
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:03.640]   under the water and then we come up again out of the water. That's a picture of resurrection.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.160]   So they say that this, they reject the sacramentarian view, number one. They say that's obviously
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:16.240]   wrong. This is only a symbol, a picture, a representation in a dramatic manner of what
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.680]   is happening to us spiritually. But they say it's a very remarkable one and a very appropriate
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.920]   one because there you are buried and then you rise. And that's what the apostle means.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:33.880]   He says your baptism was a pictorial representation of this union of yours with our Lord in his
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:45.560]   burial and in his resurrection. Well now, let's examine this. Again, I would indicate
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:51.960]   that this expression in verse four, where we are told that we are buried with him by
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:58.840]   baptism or through baptism, seems to me to militate very strongly against this exposition.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.680]   Paul doesn't say that it's a picture. Paul really is saying that it is accomplished by
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.120]   baptism or through baptism. He doesn't say this is a wonderful pictorial representation
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:18.160]   of it, a symbolical representation. He says no, by or through your baptism this happened
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:26.560]   to you. To that extent, the first explanation had a measure of truth in it. Say what you
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.360]   like against the sacramentarians, they have already at any rate got hold of this idea,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.640]   that this baptism about which the apostle is writing does achieve something. They go
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.800]   very wrong in their interpretation of how it is achieved or what is achieved, but at
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   any rate they can see that the baptism does something, through baptism, by baptism. Whereas
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.400]   this fifth explanation we are looking at doesn't really give any room for that at all. It says
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:02.160]   it's a picture, a symbolical representation, a dramatic enactment. Very well then, there
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.800]   is one objection to it. But there are other objections. Here's another.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:17.160]   The doctrine of our union with Christ says that we are united with him in all that happened
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:24.240]   to him. And the first thing that happened to him was that he was crucified. Paul, putting
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:35.000]   this same idea elsewhere, says, "I have been crucified with Christ." Where is that represented
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.680]   in this pictorial representation? How does water baptism represent crucifixion? I don't
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:50.920]   see it there. And yet it is a vital part of this, our union with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.840]   Therefore, at once there should be a doubt in our minds as to whether the apostle is
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.680]   saying that our baptism is a picture. It is something that accomplishes something, and
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.000]   it represents the whole of this union. It leads to the whole of it. So I raise a query
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.320]   against this whole notion of any representation at all. Let me give you another reason.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:22.720]   It would seem to me also that to argue that the apostle here has in his mind water baptism
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.040]   in any shape or form is to give a prominence to baptism that the apostle Paul does not
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.160]   give to baptism. Take for instance what he says in the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:42.480]   in the first chapter. Let me read to you verses 13 to 17. "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.760]   for you? Or were he baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:54.560]   you but Crispus and Gaius, lest any should say that I had baptized in thine own name.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:01.280]   And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:09.000]   other." He is not clear in his memory at this point. "For Christ sent me not to baptize,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.360]   but to preach the gospel," etc. Now, there I think we have the apostle view in general
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.680]   of baptism. He isn't appreciating it, but he certainly is not giving it this central
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:26.520]   position which this exposition suggests that it has in this great teaching in the sixth
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:34.240]   chapter of Romans. So I would argue that it gives an undue prominence to water baptism,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:41.360]   whatever the mode. But then I feel that there is a further objection.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.760]   The apostle in many other places deals with this question of our union with Christ. I
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.160]   read that section out of Ephesians 2, because he does it there again. He is concerned about
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:58.800]   this union, about Christ having been buried on behalf of us and our sins, as it were,
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.440]   buried with us, but then risen with Christ, quickened, risen with him, and then seated
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:11.200]   in the heavenly places with him. And he doesn't mention baptism at all at that point, so that
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.960]   it cannot in that sense be represented in that pictorial way. And I feel that those
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   parallel passages have a real significance in the interpretation of this passage.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.920]   "Very well," says someone, "what are you suggesting is the meaning of baptism here?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:35.360]   What is the apostle saying?" Let's approach it like this. Everybody has agreed, everybody
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:44.240]   has agreed, I think, on this, that the great spiritual truth which is taught here, and
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:52.880]   in this whole section, is our union with Christ. When I say everybody, I mean all those who
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.200]   take an evangelical view of the Scriptures, and indeed here we must include the Catholics.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:04.800]   They're concerned about that. There then is an agreement. I mean by this that people
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.560]   who just take the liberal, modernistic view, well, all they see is that we are making some
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.720]   statement that we believe in Christ, we are identifying ourselves with him, and they see
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.840]   nothing beyond that. They don't believe in this doctrine of the union of the believer
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.560]   with Christ at all. It's simply something, some matter of belief. We can forget them,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.600]   but the others are all agreed that this is the essential doctrine.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.960]   "Very well, hold that in your mind. Then take with it the statement that it is by baptism,
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:42.160]   or through baptism, that this union takes place and leads to all the consequences."
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:51.760]   Now, then, holding those two ideas as being the important ones, the question that arises
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:59.720]   is, "Well, what sort of baptism is this? What kind of baptism is there taught in the
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:07.120]   New Testament which teaches me definitely that it is a baptism that incorporates me
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.800]   into Christ and joins me to him?" Well, I think the answer is found in 1 Corinthians
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:26.600]   12, verse 13. 1 Corinthians 12, verse 13, where you read this, "For by, or in one spirit,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:36.560]   we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:43.840]   or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.000]   Now, you remember that the context of that great chapter is this. The Church is the body
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.680]   of Christ. Christ is the head, we are the body. We are all joined to him, we are all
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:01.520]   joined to one another. Yes, but how have we been joined? And the answer is this. The Holy
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:11.400]   Spirit baptizes us into the body of Christ. It is a baptism by the Holy Spirit. I am not
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:18.560]   saying baptism with the Spirit, I am saying baptism by the Spirit. It is the Spirit that
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:26.440]   baptizes us into the body, that joins us to Christ. It is this wonderful, mystical action
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:34.360]   of the Spirit. You can compare it, if you like, to the action of the Spirit in our regeneration.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:40.400]   It is he who does that, gives us this principle of life. And in exactly the same way, it is
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:47.840]   he that puts us into the body of Christ. And the expression used is that he baptizes us
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:55.120]   into Christ, into the body of Christ. You see, therefore, the conclusion at which I
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:04.560]   arrive. And it is this, that baptism by water is not at all in the mind of the Apostle in
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:12.520]   these two verses. It is this baptism that is wrought by the Spirit. Therefore, we are
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:19.280]   buried with him by baptism, or through this baptism, the Spirit's action in baptizing
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.520]   us into Christ. That is what makes me join to Christ. It is the plain, explicit teaching
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.320]   in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, indeed in the whole of that chapter, as it is in other places
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.000]   where the Apostle treats this particular aspect of truth.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.400]   And I argue further that the use of this term "planted together" in verse 5 supports
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.840]   what I am saying, because everybody has agreed that the idea of planting has got nothing
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:54.040]   to do with baptism at all. It is, as I say, grafting a shoot into a tree. "Planted together,"
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:00.560]   that is the meaning of the term. This unity, this identification, is given up the figure
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   of baptism in any shape or form there, and he is emphasizing this unity. And again, that
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.920]   is the work of the Spirit, which can be put in various ways.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.680]   Very well then, I will come again to that statement which the Apostle makes in Galatians
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:31.960]   2, 20, which is so frequently misinterpreted. "I have been crucified with Christ." I live,
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:38.920]   yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by the
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.000]   faith of the Son of God, who loved me and who gave himself for me. Now there he is teaching
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.360]   exactly the same thing. I have been crucified with Christ. I live, yet not I, but Christ
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:57.320]   which liveth in me. Now there is the identical doctrine that we have here. Baptism is not
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:05.280]   baptism. No, no. Because water baptism doesn't achieve that, it doesn't produce that. Indeed,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:11.760]   at that point, it doesn't even represent it. This is the baptism which is carried out by
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:20.040]   the Holy Spirit when he incorporates us into, plants us into, and grafts us into the Lord
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:30.440]   Jesus Christ. But as I say, what is so pitiful in a sense is that it has been necessary to
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:38.560]   say all this, because all evangelical believers are agreed in this, that the important and
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:48.680]   the vital thing is this union with Christ. Even those that talk about the pictorial representation,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:54.240]   they say, "Yes, it's the thing that is signified that matters." Very well, then. Let us, I
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:04.040]   say, hold on to the thing that matters. And it is this union with Christ. It is a doctrine
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:11.680]   which tells us that we are united with him. It is because we are united with him that
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:18.440]   we derive all these benefits from him. It is because we are united with him, the apostles
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.720]   arguing from chapter 5, 10, right the way through, it is because we are united with
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:32.360]   him that our final salvation is guaranteed. Because everything that happens to him happens
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.120]   to us. It was like that with Adam. It was that one sin of Adam that brought all the
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.360]   rest upon us. Yes, it is this action of Christ that brings all upon us. As we were united
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:51.200]   to Adam, we are now united to Christ. That's the doctrine. And therefore, we must realize
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.040]   that it is the Spirit that unites us to Christ. That's the baptism about which the apostle
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:05.560]   is speaking. This is the great thing in salvation. We are not only justified. We are not only
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:13.240]   forgiven. In a sense, as I said at the beginning, the most glorious aspect of salvation is this.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:22.160]   That I am in Christ, and Christ is in me. This union. And we must never fail to realize
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:33.320]   that. I therefore venture to say once more, is it anything but a tragedy that preoccupation
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.080]   with modes and forms of baptism, as we read these two verses, should have blinded us to
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:46.840]   that greater truth? Now let me ask a simple practical question. And let every one answer
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:56.440]   for himself and for herself. As you read these verses here at the beginning of Romans 6,
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.560]   what has been the big impression on your mind? What has been the thing you've talked about
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:09.080]   as you've talked about these verses? Has it always been our union with Christ, or has
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:17.480]   it been baptism? Now I say it is nothing short of tragic. If the big impression that this
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:25.240]   makes upon our minds is water baptism, in any form, I don't care which form, because
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:32.080]   the apostle was concerned that the big thing that is on our mind should be our union with
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:38.120]   Christ. No, no. Baptism is important. Baptism must be carried out, but don't go to the sixth
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.960]   of Romans for it. There are plenty of other places in Scripture to find it. You can get
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.920]   your doctrine of baptism, and you can discuss it and argue about it on other texts. Don't
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:56.160]   bring it in here. By one Spirit, or in one Spirit, we have all been baptized, whether
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.880]   we are Jews or Gentiles, burned or free, and we have been made to drink of that one Spirit.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:09.360]   This drinking is comparable to the baptism. It is this union and this incorporation in
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:17.200]   the Lord Jesus Christ. Very well. I do trust that having dealt with the word
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:25.280]   baptism, we can now go on to consider the glorious doctrine in its various component
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:33.040]   parts. God forbid that anybody should be stumbled by that word and miss the glories that the
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.880]   apostle here unfolds. What are they? Well, let me mention some of them before we close.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:44.960]   He starts off by saying, "Know ye not?" "Don't you know?" says the apostle. "Haven't you
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:52.920]   realized? Haven't you understood?" What does that tell us? Well, it tells us this. The
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:59.000]   apostle assumes that this is common knowledge amongst all Christians. He says, "Need I remind
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.040]   you?" as if to say, "I almost feel like apologizing for reminding you." It is common knowledge,
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.600]   this doctrine of our union with Christ, our oneness with him.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.640]   Now, the apostle had never been in Rome, as we saw in the introduction to the epistle.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.040]   He had not taught these people, and yet he says, "Of course you know this. Don't you
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.160]   know? Don't you realize? Don't you remember?" He says this to people to whom he had never
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.560]   preached at all, and to whom probably their Christianity had come not through an apostle
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.840]   at all, but through some of the subsidiary teachers. And yes, he assumes that every Christian
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:45.560]   knows this. But does every Christian know it? Did we all know it? Had we all been thrilled
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.440]   by this wonderful doctrine of our union with Christ?
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.240]   And again, look once more at what I've already quoted from the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.760]   Now, that's very significant. The Galatians, everybody's agreed, were a very primitive
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:07.440]   sort of people, an unstable people. That's why they were in trouble. They were people
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.480]   who had lived a primitive kind of life. They were poor in their intellect. But the apostle
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.280]   had preached to them, and it's perfectly clear from his epistle to them, that he had preached
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:24.640]   this doctrine of our unity with Christ, our union with Christ, even to the Galatians.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:32.920]   Now I draw a very important deduction from this, that this is something which belongs
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:39.560]   to a primitive kind of evangelism. You see, the tragedy has been that so often this doctrine
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.040]   has been regarded as a doctrine that is only applicable to people who have reached the
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:51.060]   higher heights of the Christian faith. That it's only a doctrine for some special people,
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:56.320]   that you only teach it in places where you're no longer evangelizing, you're now deepening
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.120]   the spiritual life and going down into the depths. It's for the advanced scholars, the
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:06.680]   mature saints. "Not at all," says Paul. "Don't you know?" he says to these Romans. He'd preached
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:14.520]   it to the Galatians, where he hadn't spent a very long time. I'm arguing, therefore,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:22.800]   that we are not evangelizing truly unless we present this truth, that in salvation we
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:29.960]   are not merely forgiven, we are not only justified. The whole basis of the doctrine of salvation
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.880]   is this, that we were in Adam, but are now in Christ, that we are taken out of that and
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:42.580]   put there. That's primitive evangelism. That's one of the basic elements in the presentation
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:50.140]   of the gospel. And therefore, if we are not presenting that, we are not evangelizing truly.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.600]   You see, we mustn't evangelize simply by saying, "Come to Christ and he'll do this, that, and
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.760]   the other for you." No, no. The glorious thing about salvation is that I am taken out of
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:05.900]   Adam, finished with it, dead to sin. I am in Christ, and all the blessings that come
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:13.680]   to me come because of my union with Christ. I want to emphasize this. Know ye not? Haven't
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:19.800]   you realized, haven't you grasped, haven't you understood this? That's what the apostle
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.160]   is saying at this point. The most important matter.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:31.640]   Then let me take a second point. Take this phrase of his, "So many of us know ye not,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:39.460]   that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death." What
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:48.520]   does "so many of us" mean? It means all. Nothing less than all. It's just a way of saying,
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.920]   "All of us who have been baptized into Christ." He doesn't mean to say this, you see, that
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.840]   some Christians have been baptized, but others have not. No, no. He says, "All of us, every
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:06.600]   single Christian." And again, we see the importance of this matter.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:13.440]   The apostle is not here, I repeat, teaching some esoteric doctrine to certain select individuals
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:20.120]   in the Christian life. He is saying that this is true of every single Christian. In chapter
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:24.680]   eight, when we come to verse nine, we'll find him saying this, "If any men have not the
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:31.560]   Spirit of Christ, he is none of ills." It's the same thing. If we are not united to Christ,
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.960]   we are not Christians. You can't be a Christian without being united to Christ. It's true
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:49.160]   of all Christians. The Holy Spirit, I repeat, who convicts us of sin, the Holy Spirit who
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:59.120]   gives us the principle of life, regenerates us, is the same Spirit that at the same time
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:05.640]   joins us to Christ. And it is true of every single Christian. In other words, it introduces
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:14.040]   this aspect of the matter. We must never interpret these verses in terms of experience. The apostle
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:19.040]   is not dealing with experience at this point. He comes on to that later. What he's dealing
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:25.080]   with here is something that has happened to us, something that is true of us. It is the
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:31.800]   action of the Holy Spirit upon us. We may not be aware of it as we ought to be. The
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.760]   apostle clearly is suggesting that there were certain Christians in Rome who were not clear
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.880]   about this as they should be. As I'm indicating, there are still people like that today. It
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.760]   doesn't mean that they're not Christians. Thank God it doesn't. If we were saved by
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:49.560]   our understanding and experience of truth, well, then God helped many of us. Thank God
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.840]   we are not saved by that. We are saved by this tremendous action of God through the
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:01.640]   Spirit who takes us out of Adam, incorporates us, implants us, baptizes us into Christ.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.400]   That's the thing that saves us. And it happens to all of us, says Paul. And he's anxious
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:14.000]   that we should realize it and understand it, and then draw our deductions from it. So let
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.560]   us get clear that he is not dealing with experience, but status, condition, position. And there
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:30.720]   are only two positions. We are either, every one of us, in Adam, or else we are in Christ.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:38.800]   There is no middle position. You can't be a saved man without being joined to Christ,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:45.400]   without being in Christ. There is no middle position. There is no sort of beginning. And
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:53.080]   then you go on to something else. All of us, every one of us, so many of us, have in this
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:58.120]   way been baptized into Christ.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.600]   And then you notice, and this is the last point I shall make this evening, that what
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:14.920]   he's emphasizing is that we have been baptized into Jesus Christ, into Jesus Christ himself,
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:24.440]   into the person, which leads me to say this, we are not baptized into parts of him or aspects
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:32.920]   of the truth concerning him. We are baptized into Jesus Christ, the whole of him. Paul
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.080]   puts that in writing the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 1, verse 30, in this
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:46.920]   way, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:55.360]   and sanctification and redemption." Now, you must never say that you've taken Christ
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.200]   as your justification or as your righteousness, and that later on you may take him as your
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:06.600]   sanctification. That's dividing Christ, and he cannot be divided. There is nothing so
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:14.880]   unscriptural, so wrong, so fatal, as to divide up Christ and to say, "Ah, yes, I'm justified.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.840]   I've received his righteousness, and then I go to a meeting which exhorts me to take
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:24.240]   him as my sanctification by faith, as I've already taken him as my justification by faith."
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.280]   You can't do that. You either take him or not, and you're baptized into him, not parts
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:39.000]   of him, the whole of Christ. And the apostle says so. He says we're baptized into Jesus
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.480]   Christ, and he says elsewhere, "We are complete in him." When? Now. Not, "We are going to
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:54.360]   be complete." We are complete in him, here and now. And therefore, I say we must once
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:04.440]   more get rid of this notion of experience at this point. Whatever your experience, whatever
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:12.280]   your feeling may be, I tell you this, if you are a Christian, you are complete in Christ.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:20.880]   He is now your wisdom, your righteousness, your sanctification, and your redemption.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.640]   Now. You may go on to experience these things more and more, and we should. That's why we
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.080]   need to be taught. That's why we need to be exhorted to apply what we've learned. But
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.760]   that doesn't make any difference to the fact. What the apostle is saying here is this. You
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.920]   are no longer in Adam, you are in Christ. Well, if you're in him, all that is true of
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:50.040]   him is true of you. You'll realize it progressively, but it's true now. It's the guarantee of your
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:59.000]   final complete redemption, of your being delivered of every spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.920]   Life is my sanctification now. If I die at this moment, I am sanctified in him, as I'm
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:19.040]   justified in him, as I'm glorified. He is all this to me. I am baptized into Jesus Christ.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:25.000]   Very well. There is the first big statement. The apostle is now going on to divide it up,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.400]   you see. Because I'm in Christ, well, I'm in his death, I'm in his life, I'm in everything.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:37.920]   But get hold of this. The thing to understand is that we are baptized into the Lord Jesus
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:43.960]   Christ himself. Everything that was true of Adam became true of me, because I was in Adam.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:50.160]   I come out of him. Very well. In exactly the same way, only as he has argued still more
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:59.480]   so, grace has superabounded. All that is in Christ and true of him in his relationship
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:08.640]   to the redeemed is mine, because I'm in him. And all that he has done and has accomplished
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:15.200]   becomes mine, as all that Adam did and accomplished became mine. That's the doctrine. We've worked
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:20.440]   it out in detail and at great length from chapter 5, verse 10 until this moment, and
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:25.040]   the apostle is going on with it. And you see, it's vital to what follows. It is because
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:31.800]   I am in Christ that I'm in his death, in his resurrection, in his life, in everything.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:44.040]   So I have taken the trouble to emphasize these words, "All of us, and all of us, baptized
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:52.120]   into him himself, the whole of him as he is, and not particular aspects only of his work
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:58.200]   at any given point." Very well. Then there, having got hold of his fundamental teaching
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.880]   and doctrine, we shall now be in a very happy position to go through the following statements,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:09.520]   which to me are really quite simple in view of what we've already said. If we haven't
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:14.000]   grasped this, we must find everything else difficult. But if you've got this key, well,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.280]   the rest follows as the night, the day, inevitably, and really shouldn't detain us at much length.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:27.200]   Well, God willing, we'll go out, we'll go on next Friday evening to work out the way
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:36.000]   the apostle deduces things from this primary, central, fundamental statement. Let us pray.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
