[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.160]   All right, so it's day two.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.880]   Well, it's not technically day two.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   It's a few days since my last video.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.720]   So I decided that to make this podcast real,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800]   I need to have a Jerry Maguire-like mission statement
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.200]   or manifesto or something.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.360]   And so I decided, I just started writing things
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.840]   that matter to me, like unemployment is one,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.440]   developing skills is another.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.080]   And then I realized that I need to find people
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.380]   as I'm interviewing them who have the same passion
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.000]   as I do about this topic.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.440]   And I want my vision to be easily understood
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.080]   as I'm kind of conveying what the scope is.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.960]   And so I decided to write a letter to my future guests-to-be
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   and the idea is kind of like cold call.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.000]   I've got my Rolodex of people that I would love to speak to
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.520]   and as a part of my outreach,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.720]   I want to send them this letter
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.240]   so they know what I'm trying to do, right?
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.360]   And they want to be a part of it.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.880]   Awesome, and then we're on the same page.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.720]   They don't, no harm, no foul.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.080]   And so I probably wrote this letter,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.360]   like rewrote it like probably 15 or 20 different times,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.280]   starting from like a three pager down to like a paragraph,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.160]   realizing that's too short and then expand a little bit
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.320]   and finally landing at a happy place.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.080]   And I'm really proud of it.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.000]   I wanted to read it to you
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.080]   'cause I think this is gonna be the foundation,
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.680]   like my source of truth where if I'm having a rough day
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.280]   or I find myself veering off course,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.400]   I can always go back to this letter to reground myself
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.360]   on why I'm doing this and to not deviate
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.680]   from the true or honest nature of what I'm trying to solve for.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.120]   So let me read it to you.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.000]   A letter to my guest speakers.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.480]   When I graduated from high school,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.240]   my impressions of my career options were pretty limited
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   or heavily influenced by perceptions impressed upon me
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.640]   by my family, peers, and in many cases, my culture.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.120]   And their intention was to set me on a course
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.400]   to achieve maximum job security or income
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.480]   through what was popular at the time,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   medicine, law, engineering.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   However, when lack of college academic success
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   closed the door on all of them,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.960]   it left me floundering and ashamed.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.520]   Pride annihilated.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.600]   As I picked up the pieces
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.120]   and took on any job that I could find,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   I leaned on the one thing
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.360]   that does not distinguish me on the resume,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   relationship building.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.040]   If I could go back in time
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040]   and give myself one piece of advice,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.960]   it would be simply this,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.880]   keep your head up, explore all your options,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.280]   intentionally learn something from each job experience,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.320]   and one day, your experience will catch up
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.960]   and relationship building will become your greatest asset.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.360]   That in a sense is what I want our viewers
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   to take away from these videos.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.280]   There is hope and there is a path to get there.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.080]   There are a lot of people in the job market today
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.720]   who have had their sense of self-identity
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.360]   crushed through layoffs and closed opportunities.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   They're looking at the job that has left them
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.920]   and wondering what they should have
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   or could have done differently.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080]   They are wondering what their options are
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.240]   but are frightened about change.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   For early career individuals,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.720]   they may not know all the options available to them
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.440]   or they may have misconceptions
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.680]   about what any particular job function is.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.200]   The purpose of these videos
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.880]   is to help them understand what their options are
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.480]   to get a true, unbiased, and genuine perspective
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.560]   from seasoned experts like you
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.000]   on what it takes to succeed in your role.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.960]   To help them understand what skill sets are needed
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.920]   should they decide to transition to your field
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.760]   or learn from you so they can grow further
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.000]   in the role you are representing.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.760]   Thank you for joining me on this mission
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.040]   to create more economic opportunity for our global community.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.120]   Humbly yours, Tim Chen.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.760]   I thought I would share that.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.440]   That's as far as I've gotten.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.720]   Next up is the Rolodex conversation.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.840]   I have my list of people I want to speak to.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.760]   What I've done is I've looked at all of the job functions.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.320]   Again, starting in high tech.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.040]   So like digital marketing, search and optimization,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.600]   market research, operations, sales, comms,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.680]   demand generation, insight sales,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.600]   design.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.000]   Categorically, I'm just making sure
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.360]   that I have all of those identified
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.480]   so I don't miss anything.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   So there's obviously more than that.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.720]   Product management is one I added last night.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.080]   And so I have names now to each of those.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.720]   And each of those functions,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   I have around two to three names.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.560]   Hopefully at least one of those names
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.000]   will take me up on it.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.480]   And we'll see where it goes.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.440]   I created a rough outline
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.360]   on what our conversation flow would be.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   So I created a little quick video details spreadsheet
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.400]   that I sent to them where I talk about
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   my primary audience, my secondary audience,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.640]   give them some advice on what attire
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.000]   they would want to wear, how we're recording.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.480]   We'll be using Zoom.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.680]   And then more importantly, the content outline.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.360]   And it's pretty straightforward, again,
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.640]   because I want these to be as organic as possible.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.400]   So broadly, the first topic will be,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.880]   tell us about your job function,
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.280]   how to do it, and why it matters.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.360]   The second one will be around skill sets
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.400]   or experience or education required.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.960]   And then the third category would be around
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.240]   what you should know if you're considering
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.000]   a new career in this field.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And I think I'm gonna ask a lot of questions
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.280]   around understanding their own career journey.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.120]   Was it linear?
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.640]   Was it choose your own adventure, right?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.400]   And did it do this like mine did?
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.880]   And then what did they learn along the way?
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.200]   And then the last one is like,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.600]   what are the career growth path
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.920]   for people who are currently practicing that function?
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.520]   So again, I'm trying to cover the spectrum
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.080]   of early career, mid, and senior.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.000]   And so that's generally kind of how I'm gonna be doing this.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.440]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.320]   Wish me luck.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
