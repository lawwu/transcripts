[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   you say that the more we invest in health care,
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.000]   the sicker we get.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   People don't quite understand how bad the statistics are.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.520]   So right now, 74% of American adults overweight or obese.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.880]   1 in 2 Americans in their lifetime
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   are expected to get cancer.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.160]   We're going to have the highest number of cancer cases
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.760]   ever in history this year, over 2 million new cases.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.060]   Young adult cancers are up 79%.
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720]   So our health is not good.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.060]   We are spending actually 2x more than any other country
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.520]   in the entire world on health care,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.540]   and we have dismal health outcomes.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.800]   We have the worst infant and maternal mortality
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.820]   of any developed country in the United States.
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.280]   It's more dangerous for me to give birth in this country
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.160]   than if I went to any other high income country in the world.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.760]   This is wild, because $4.3 trillion
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.220]   are spent on health care each year.
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.080]   That's 23 or so percent of the largest GP in the country.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.660]   And meanwhile, it's a train wreck,
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.720]   and life expenses has been going down for the past three years.
