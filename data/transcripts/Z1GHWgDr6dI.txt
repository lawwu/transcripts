[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.520]   - Welcome to Google Heads on Investing podcast number 46.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.520]   Today we focus on ESG,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.380]   Environmental, Social and Governance Investing.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.440]   Our two guests are Larry Suedro,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.600]   talking about his new book, "Sustainable Investing",
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.320]   and Dr. Ellen Quigley,
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.800]   a Senior Research Associate in Climate Risk
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.300]   and Sustainable Finance,
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.920]   and also a Special Advisor to the Chief Financial Officer
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.520]   at the University of Cambridge.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:49.120]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.440]   and I'm the host of "Google Heads on Investing".
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.480]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.440]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440]   Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.840]   a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.280]   that you can find at boglecenter.net.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.960]   Your tax deductible contributions are greatly appreciated.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.680]   And don't forget about our Bogle Heads Conference
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.800]   coming up this October 12th through the 14th
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.520]   in a suburb of Chicago.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.240]   There are a few tickets left
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300]   and we would love to see you there.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.240]   Our focus today is on ESG investing.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.600]   ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.920]   It's the hottest thing
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.680]   in the investment industry right now.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.160]   Hundreds of mutual funds and ETFs have been created
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   clamoring for your dollars,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.320]   enticing you to invest with your conscience
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.840]   in addition to with your money.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.260]   But is this really a strategy to take seriously?
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.080]   Does it actually achieve the goal of environmentally friendly,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.260]   socially responsible, and better governance
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.640]   in how corporations behave and make decisions?
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   Or is ESG a scam, as Elon Musk said recently?
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.600]   That's my discussion today with two special guests,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.440]   Larry Swedrow, chief research officer
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.480]   for Buckingham Strategic Wealth
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.800]   and the co-author of a new book called "Sustainable Investing"
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.040]   and Dr. Ellen Quigley, who is a senior research associate
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.000]   in climate risk and sustainable finance
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.280]   at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.600]   and also a special advisor to the chief financial officer
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.920]   at the University of Cambridge.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000]   I promise you this will be an interesting podcast.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.400]   First up is Larry Swedrow.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.600]   With no further ado, let me introduce Larry Swedrow.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.200]   Welcome again to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, Larry.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.400]   - Good to be back with you, Rick.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.320]   - Larry, your latest book with Samuel Adams
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.900]   is titled "Your Sensible Guide to Sustainable Investing,
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.680]   "How to Live Your Lives and Achieve Your Financial Goals
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   "with ESG, SRI, and Impact Investing."
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.920]   But before we begin, I just wanna remind people
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.640]   of who you are.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.200]   You're the chief research officer
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.480]   for Buckingham Strategic Wealth
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   and has published 10 books and has co-authored seven books,
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.540]   and this is the seventh.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.840]   Now, your co-author is Samuel Adams.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.520]   Could you tell us how you met Sam
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.120]   and why you decided to write this book together?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.480]   - Yeah, I actually met Sam probably about 25 years ago now
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.080]   where he was our regional director at Dimensional,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.360]   so I got to know him there and enjoyed working with him.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.440]   And then I'd followed his career.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.400]   He had moved to England to help start a DFA business there
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.840]   or grow it, and then he left to follow his passion.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.360]   He created a, I think, the first
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.920]   and maybe still only sustainable real estate fund
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.320]   called VRT.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.440]   A reason I contacted and reached out to Sam
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.040]   to write the book is I noticed
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.600]   there was a dramatic increase, beginning really in 2018,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.880]   in investor interest in ESG investing
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.360]   with massive amounts of cash flows.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.320]   And as usual, academic research tends to follow
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.160]   whatever is the hot subject,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.760]   and dozens and dozens of papers were being written,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.120]   and I would write them up
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   so I could convey what the research was finding.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.520]   And then I said, "Well, it'd be great if we had a book
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.360]   "to discuss these issues and show people
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.980]   "what the real evidence from empirical research showed
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.960]   "as well as the theory behind it
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.360]   "so you could make a good informed decision
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.120]   "about whether you wanted to be an ESG investor or not."
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.440]   So I had the knowledge and skills to write the part
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.760]   on the empirical research, the economic theory,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.000]   and the impact of behavior on corporations.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.600]   And Sam had all of this knowledge
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.000]   as a nationally known speaker in the field
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.380]   about the whole history of the SRI, ESG,
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.380]   impact investing movement.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.160]   So I reached out to him and suggested we join forces,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.780]   and he wrote, in effect, the first half of the book
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.420]   with my help, and then he helped me complete the second half.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.700]   So it was a good fit for Sam,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.340]   and I enjoyed working with him very much.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.620]   - Yeah, and that did come out, by the way,
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.240]   when I was reading the book, it seemed to me clear
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.860]   that Sam had wrote the beginning,
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.580]   and you wrote the research portion in the middle.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.240]   And then, at the end, you probably collaborated together
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.780]   on the how to do it portion,
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.260]   which is how the book is really divided
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.700]   into three different sections that way.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.900]   In fact, the first section, which defines ESG investing
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.020]   and the evolution, if you will, of ESG investing,
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.540]   and I just want to point to the title of your book,
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.580]   the whole title, because in it,
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.180]   it kind of talks about one of the issues.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.780]   Your title of your book is Sustainable Investing,
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.020]   How to Live Your Values and Achieve Your Financial Goals
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.020]   with ESG, SRI, and Impact Investing.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.180]   So in the title of your book,
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.560]   you have four different strategies, I assume,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.100]   and it's all very confusing.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.480]   So if you could start with
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.940]   how did this whole evolution begin,
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.100]   and what all these terms mean.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.380]   - It's really a great question.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.140]   We struggled with how to title the book,
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.540]   'cause ESG is probably the most familiar term,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.320]   maybe SRI before that.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.020]   But I think Sam did a great job
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.320]   in writing the history of the movement.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.900]   I'll see if I can summarize it briefly.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.300]   So the original thinking was negative
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.980]   or exclusionary screening to screen out values
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.660]   that you wanted to express.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.580]   So you might think of the Quakers' Civil War,
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.860]   screening out any company engaged in the slave trade,
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.820]   eventually became sort of a holy trinity,
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.620]   if you will, of sin industries,
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.980]   tobacco, alcohol, and gambling.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.680]   You might add pornography, it would be another.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.040]   Some people add defense industries.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.380]   And that focused on your personal values.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.700]   So that's an important distinction here.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.960]   Then we got a movement towards ESG,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.140]   which focuses on the companies and their behavior
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.980]   in the areas of climate change or environment,
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.420]   social and diversity and governance.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.560]   And then the last part became impact investing,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   which is really a desire to make change in the world
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.180]   and not focusing on the return mostly.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.260]   So Rick Ferry decides he wants to help the people in Africa
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.540]   and he's gonna invest in a company
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.820]   that helps build water wells so they can get clean water.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.580]   And he thinks that's a much better way to do it
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.540]   than giving money to some government
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.500]   because he knows the history is,
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.180]   often that ends up lining the pockets of politicians
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.620]   and it's not sustainable.
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.980]   So if you do it through businesses
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.740]   that continue to ongoing,
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.020]   it tends to be more sustainable from that aspect.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.220]   So the purpose of it is,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.700]   hey, I really wanna help the world.
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.260]   If I get a good return, that's great.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.800]   But if not, that's also okay.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.700]   So that's sort of the three ways break it down.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.220]   One screen out, that's negative screening, that's the SRI.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.320]   ESG focuses on the corporate behavior,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.900]   but you still wanna achieve your financial goals.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.140]   And impact investing is sort of almost
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.980]   to the edge of pure philanthropy
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.340]   where it's just the financial end
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.820]   is a secondary consideration.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.180]   And sustainable investing encompasses all of it.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.420]   - Basically you're putting under the umbrella
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.120]   of sustainable investing, you're putting ESG,
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.660]   well SRI, which has to do with screening,
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.860]   ESG, which has to do with changing company behavior,
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.040]   and impact investing, which has more to do with philanthropy
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.560]   and you're putting it all under sustainable investing.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.820]   - Impact investing is just closer to philanthropy.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.180]   There's still a financial incentive
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.140]   'cause you're hoping to get a return,
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.380]   but that's not the main objective.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.420]   - Okay, and then there are other things too.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.340]   And I just wanna go through this laundry list of names.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.540]   Green investing, responsible investing,
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.100]   value-based investing, ethical investing,
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.640]   purposeful investing.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.220]   I mean, is this all just one sub-level
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.940]   of one of these other ones?
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.020]   - Yeah, green just infers to companies
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.620]   that have say good scores from an ESG perspective.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.660]   Then you have on the flip side of green
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.980]   or brown or sin stocks.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.260]   Values-driven is really SRI, a type of investing
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.080]   where you're often screening out companies.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.980]   So it's all under the same umbrella.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.640]   And that's why we chose to use that term
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.600]   sustainable investing as a broad category
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   covering all of them.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.920]   - Okay, that's the first part of the book
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.020]   that covers the first six chapters,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.880]   which covers breaking out and defining
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.400]   what all of these different aspects
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.120]   of sustainable investing are.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.440]   The second part of the book,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.120]   basically the part that you wrote with Sam's help
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.720]   had to do with returns and the impact
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.440]   that doing this actually has on society or on companies.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.440]   And with that, I wanna go to the introduction
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.600]   because the introduction was written by Burton Malkiel,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.480]   of course, a famous Princeton professor
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.640]   who wrote "A Random Walk Down Wall Street."
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.000]   And when I was reading the introduction,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.520]   and then I read the book, I had to scratch my head.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.620]   Let me just give you the five things
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.000]   that Malkiel said right in the introduction.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.440]   And so number one, he said,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.600]   talking about ESG objectives,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.280]   the term means different things to different people
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.120]   and it is difficult for investors to understand exactly
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.800]   what the ESG portfolios actually achieve.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.200]   That's number one.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.920]   Number two, ESG ratings, what you alluded to,
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.160]   ratings of companies, differ remarkably
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.860]   from one provider to another.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.880]   He gave an example of Carbon Footprints
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.540]   where one company would be rated high
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.740]   and another ESG rating service would be rated low.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.140]   So there's a lot of discrepancy between these ESG ratings.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.700]   But number three, he mentioned return.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.860]   And he said, "Investors who wish to invest sustainably
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.000]   "should have reasonable expectations,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.460]   "including a willingness to accept lower,
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.540]   "long run returns."
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.700]   So that was number three.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.140]   And number four, this is talking about the ESG portion
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.920]   of affecting company's behavior.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.480]   There is no clear evidence, however,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.780]   that disinvestment from unsustainable firms
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.020]   has interfered with their ability to raise capital.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.280]   So those firms that are excluded,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.060]   there's no evidence that it had any effect on them,
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.900]   financially.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.540]   And finally, he's talking about the funds
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.580]   and the way that you would invest in ESG.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.100]   He said, "Funds are less diversified and more expensive
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.540]   "than pure index funds and may well underperform
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.820]   "in the long run."
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.460]   So I'm reading this introduction, I'm saying,
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.180]   I mean, I give you a lot of credit for publishing it,
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.380]   but what are your comments on all that?
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.780]   - Well, that's why we wrote the book,
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.100]   is to address every one of those issues.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.900]   Amal is right in raising these questions, Rick.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.900]   So why don't we take each one of them one at a time,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.020]   pick the first one,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.660]   and then we'll go through each of those five,
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.340]   and we'll try to answer them quickly.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.180]   - Okay.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.340]   The first one is why would anybody even wanna do this?
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.940]   I mean, what is the purpose?
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.500]   - The first answer to that is a lot of people
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.980]   want to express their values through their investing.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.020]   They don't wanna support industries
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.100]   that their belief system doesn't agree with.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.700]   So whether it's gambling or abortion
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.540]   or companies I don't wanna support
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.460]   who don't treat women or minorities fairly,
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.900]   they will want to say,
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.540]   "I'm not gonna invest in those companies."
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.860]   Companies that pollute the planet
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.820]   aren't investing in sustainable investing and renewables.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.620]   So that's the main purpose.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.060]   Many people at least think about
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   why we wanna do sustainable investing, ESG or SRI.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.540]   - Thank you for that.
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.940]   Let me go on to the second one.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.620]   Talking about ESG ratings.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.540]   Now, first of all, describe companies that do ESG ratings
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.340]   and what are they trying to achieve
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.180]   and why are they vastly different
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.340]   when you look at the ratings of one provider
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.940]   looking at one company
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.180]   and another provider looking at the same company?
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.020]   - Yeah.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.420]   So here we have a little bit of bad news for investors.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.700]   It's not like in the corporate bond market.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.660]   As you know, Rick,
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.020]   we have Fitch, Moody's and S&P.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.900]   And if you look at Fitch's rating for a company,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.620]   if it's BBB, the odds are almost 100%.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.780]   The other two ratings will also be BBB.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.180]   We have a huge disparity in the ratings
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.980]   among seven companies.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.300]   The major ones include MSCI, Morningstar,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.580]   Sustain Analytics and a couple of others.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.140]   So seven big players in the industry.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.260]   And it's very easy to point out why there can be differences.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.740]   Just think about, for example,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.740]   you have the three categories of ESG
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.540]   that everyone looks at now.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.820]   But Rick Ferry as a rater decides to give a one third rating
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.420]   or equal importance to each of those.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.060]   But another rater gives 70% to climate,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.980]   20% to the S and 10% to the G.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.380]   So you're gonna get very different answers.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.980]   And Rick Ferry decides when he looks at the social question,
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.180]   he's gonna look at how many women and minorities
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.260]   on the board.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.580]   And another firm will look at the number of managers
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.300]   who are women and minorities.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.020]   And a third will decide to look at pay gaps.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.460]   And if they look at all three,
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.580]   they may weight them differently.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.900]   On climate, you get some really interesting questions
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.580]   'cause there's not a mandatory requirement
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.140]   that the SEC has about what you have to report.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.060]   So there's something, a breakdown that is called scope one,
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.140]   scope two, and scope three emissions.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.500]   Most companies only report what is called scope two.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.460]   Those are the emissions you create by making your product.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.500]   Scope one is all the inputs that you get
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.140]   when you get the materials and stuff to then make.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.340]   And scope three includes the product
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.820]   when it gets delivered to Rick Ferry, the consumer.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.300]   So you might think, and I'm just making this up,
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.980]   but someone could look at Amazon and say,
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.420]   it's a great company.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.420]   All its electricity is created by solar electricity,
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.860]   other renewables, they don't produce anything.
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.940]   So there's not a pollution there.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.260]   But then if you look at scope three,
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.820]   and again, I'm making this up,
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.060]   they have all these thousands, if not tens of thousands
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.660]   of trucks driving around polluting the air.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.340]   So if you look at scope three,
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.060]   which most companies don't even report on,
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.740]   you could come up with a very different answer.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.020]   And we show in the book, very wide dispersions.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.700]   - The company that comes to mind
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   on this issue is Tesla, right?
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   So a Tesla car, you've got to import all of this stuff
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.420]   and it's a lot of plastic, right?
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.900]   And which is petroleum.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.780]   And so what is the carbon signature of producing the pieces
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.660]   that go to the Tesla manufacturing plant,
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.020]   which then gets assembled, and that's a cost too,
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.940]   but they have a lot of solar panels on the roof.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.220]   So maybe it's not that much of a carbon footprint.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.260]   And then the cars go out there and are sold
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.100]   and there is a carbon footprint
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.300]   to producing the electricity.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.220]   So in your framework of one, two, three,
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.500]   could you look at Tesla?
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.940]   - Yeah, it's a really difficult question
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.460]   and you can see why you have such disparity in the ratings.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.060]   You even didn't cover one important point,
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.660]   which is all the like lithium and rare metals
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.460]   that go into the batteries and stuff,
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.300]   that all goes in and you're destroying the earth,
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.220]   ripping it apart and using masses amounts of water,
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.540]   which the world is short of water in many places.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.180]   So it's gonna depend on how you look at it.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.140]   And as you point out, yeah, you don't use any gasoline,
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.980]   but you're creating, you're using energy to charge your car
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.420]   and where are the power lines and the electricity
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.980]   and maybe it's a coal plant that's using it.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.020]   So it's a very difficult question.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.900]   And our recommendation in the book
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.620]   is really for people to decide on,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.020]   okay, I'm gonna go with one rating company
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.460]   and I'll look at how they do things and just say,
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.220]   it may not be perfect, it may not align,
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.220]   but it's better than the alternative of not looking at all.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.980]   - All right, now we'll go on to number three.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.780]   It is Burton Malkiel's view
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.420]   that your expectation of return should be lower.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.580]   Why would people want to invest in something
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.420]   in the core of their portfolio
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.500]   where the expectation of the equity side
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.580]   is gonna be lower than the market?
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.340]   - Yeah, it's a very interesting question
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.220]   and it's actually pretty complex
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.380]   and we go to a great deal of time in the book
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.500]   to help people understand the issue.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.820]   So let's begin with where I always like to begin,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.620]   which is economic theory.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:38.620]   If enough people screen out certain industries or companies,
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.620]   their P/E will be lower than it would be otherwise,
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.260]   their cost of their debt will be higher,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.100]   they'll pay a higher interest rate
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.460]   and the screened in companies will get more cash flow
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.700]   driving their valuations up
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.340]   and the cost of their debt down.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.940]   And that's nice economic theory.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.100]   There's also, so you could call that a taste
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.620]   or a preference-based resulting premium
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.940]   for being a Brown or SIN investor.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.580]   There's also a risk-based story
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.940]   'cause if you're a bad polluter,
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.540]   well, you could get big problems like Exxon Valdez
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.860]   and have spent billions of dollars in cleanup costs.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.740]   If you're a bad employer, you could get headline news
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.380]   and have massive lawsuits
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.900]   and no one wants to work for you because you discriminate.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.260]   If you have bad governance,
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.420]   you don't have good risk controls
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.980]   and those kinds of companies have lots of problems
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.220]   often manipulating earnings, right?
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.340]   You get all these accruals.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.220]   So it turns out that the companies that have good ratings
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.500]   tend to be less risky, which is very logical,
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   less risk of consumer boycotts,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.820]   frauds, environmental incidents.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.860]   So there's a risk-based story.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.300]   If you're a green company,
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.820]   you're investing in safer companies,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.820]   you should expect lower returns.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.260]   What's nice in this case is the academic theory
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.300]   lines up perfectly with the empirical evidence
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.820]   right up till 2018.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.540]   There are studies showing the sin stocks outperform
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.980]   the non-sin stocks by about 2.5% to 3% a year,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.620]   depending upon what factor model you benchmarked it against
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.620]   or against the S&P about 2.5% to 3% as well.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.820]   Along comes this massive trend,
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.540]   which was like indexing in the '70s, '80s, and '90s,
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.020]   very slow trickle,
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.340]   and then it exploded in the last 20 years.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.300]   The SRI movement didn't really pick up steam.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.500]   It was a little trickle.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.340]   And in 2018, it started going way up,
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.100]   probably because of the impact on climate change
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.220]   was becoming more evident.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.780]   And tens of billions of dollars flew in.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.340]   So all of the research, as we show in the book,
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.180]   where studies end in 2017,
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.380]   show brown stocks outperforming just as we would expect.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.980]   And people could make the decision,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.900]   I'm willing to pay that price to express my values.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.340]   That's a personal decision.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.380]   However, now you have what we call conflicting forces.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.220]   All this cash flows are coming in, driving valuations up.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.060]   And there was a nice paper called "Dynamic Equilibrium"
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.740]   that talked about this.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.940]   So what they found is from 2018 through 2020,
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.980]   that three-year period,
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.140]   even though brown stocks should be expected to outperform
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.100]   by about, let's call it 3%,
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.340]   green outperformed by seven.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.020]   So there was in effect a 10% greening.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.380]   - But it wasn't a lot of that just industry sector.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.380]   I mean, most of the green,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.820]   or a lot of the green has to do with technology.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.540]   You know, Google, Microsoft.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:58.500]   I mean, obviously we had this big growth spurt in tech
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.220]   like we did in the late 1990s.
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.060]   And when you look at the ESG footprints of Facebook
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.580]   and so forth, they score pretty high.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.700]   So these portfolios tend to be heavily weighted
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.260]   towards technology stocks.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.460]   And that may have been true during this technology run,
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.900]   but what's going on this year?
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.180]   And I don't know if you track it monthly or such,
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.340]   but isn't it the opposite of what's going on?
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.940]   I mean, aren't we back to brown again?
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.740]   - Well, first Rick, your point is absolutely right.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.700]   There are certain industries that tend to be more green.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.740]   Also, it should be obvious that green stocks
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.780]   are gonna be more like growth companies
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.780]   because the brown stocks are screened out.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.900]   They're gonna have lower valuations almost by definition,
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.380]   and therefore are gonna be value.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.980]   And that 18 through 20 period
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.580]   was the biggest drawdown for value in history.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.220]   And money was chasing it, as you well aware.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.860]   Most investors are performance chasers.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.740]   So you had that cashflow pouring in
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.140]   and driving green stocks up,
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.420]   and that led to massive outperformance.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.940]   And the point we make in the book
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.380]   is that that trend only made the brown
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.860]   or SYN premium bigger in the future,
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.540]   but we're still likely early in the game, Rick.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.100]   Only a third of US money about is invested sustainably,
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.900]   yet the surveys show 80 to 90% of the people
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.700]   are interested in investing that way.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.420]   - Okay, I just have one comment about those surveys,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.860]   and then we'll go on to the number four thing.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.220]   Okay, I've read the surveys, I've read the questions,
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.620]   and it's how you ask the question
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.820]   because the question is generally asked,
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.580]   if there's no difference in your rate of return,
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.220]   whether you do ESG or whether you do
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.100]   a total market index fund,
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.860]   would you prefer to invest in a way that helps the world?
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.180]   Yes or no?
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.260]   And obviously, if you ask the question that way,
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.340]   the answer is gonna be, oh, no.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.500]   I mean, if there's no difference in my return,
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.580]   then I would invest in a way that helps the world.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.940]   - Yeah, you're absolutely right, Rick.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.620]   That's why we don't know
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.500]   whether we're in the third or fourth inning
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.980]   'cause we're 33% and it's gonna be 80%
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.580]   or maybe we're in the eighth inning
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.340]   and it's 33% and it's gonna go to 40.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.340]   Nobody knows, but what we do know
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.620]   is the demographics favor more of a trend
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.980]   to sustainable investing 'cause the younger generation
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.820]   is investing more heavily in that way.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.980]   So I think it's likely we're in
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.060]   maybe the middle innings of this game
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.140]   where green can continue to at least match
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.540]   or maybe even slightly outperform,
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.460]   but I certainly could be wrong.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.140]   And this year, as you point out,
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.300]   with energy stocks leading the way
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.260]   because of the situation in the Ukraine,
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:50.980]   that problem and other related industries benefiting
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.900]   from that and value is now outperforming again.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.460]   So, you know, this year probably Brown is outperforming.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.020]   I would not make a bet either way,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.140]   but I think there is some good hope people could say,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.860]   I wanna invest sustainably
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.780]   and because of this trends continue,
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.060]   I may get lucky and have green continue
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.660]   to at least match and not have to pay a penalty.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.300]   - And chapter seven gets to his fourth question,
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.620]   which is there's no clear evidence that disinvestment,
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.900]   meaning not owning the Brown stocks,
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.300]   has interfered with their ability to raise capital.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.660]   So in other words, the impact in the market isn't there,
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.420]   he can't find it.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:41.340]   - Well, I think he's right and wrong at the same time.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.340]   So he's right about the point
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.140]   that it doesn't impact the company's ability
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.420]   to raise capital because all stocks
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.860]   have to be owned by somebody.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.700]   And if you screen it out or divest,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.700]   somebody else is gonna be a buyer.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.180]   So there are people who are willing to pay a price,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.820]   if you will, and get higher expected returns
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.660]   and hold their nose to own these Brown companies,
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.940]   if you will, and expectation of getting higher returns
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.420]   for their higher risk.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.380]   But what it does do is it does mean
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.260]   you're going to have a higher cost of that capital.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.260]   And corporate executives, Rick Ferry is CFO of a company
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.820]   in the oil industry, let's say it's Shell Oil,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.380]   and he sees total petroleum trading
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.300]   at a higher P/E ratio than them
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:36.260]   because it gets a higher rating as a sustainable company
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.900]   because it is saying,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.820]   we're not gonna abandon our energy investments,
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.860]   but we're not gonna invest anymore in new fields.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.060]   We're gonna take all those profits
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.940]   and invest it in renewable, sustainable sources.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.580]   And it turns out the energy industry,
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.900]   the Brown dirty industry that lots of people exclude,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.140]   is generating the most green patents.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.660]   And to me, it makes no sense to deprive the good companies
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.020]   of that capital.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.420]   So Malthiel's incorrect.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.940]   The evidence as we present in the book is very clear
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.740]   that corporate executives are taking note of the fact
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.940]   that if they get poor scores,
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.060]   their cost of capital is higher.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.700]   So they're changing their behavior.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.940]   They're trying to make efforts at diversity
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.860]   to get better social scores, attract employees.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.580]   And here's maybe possibly the most important bit
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.020]   of good news.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.020]   We do know that the evidence on corporate profitability
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.860]   is when you have satisfied employees,
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.060]   they're more productive and companies are more profitable.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.940]   People wanna work for companies that express
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.780]   and live their values.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.500]   And if you have bad scores,
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.780]   it's very tough to attract people,
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.860]   especially the younger generation now.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.620]   And today we're in the tightest labor market in history.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.620]   So corporations are well aware they better get good scores
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.500]   and you're seeing more action on diversity, climate issues.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.580]   And that is changing corporate behavior as well.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.860]   There are a whole bunch of studies
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.860]   which we cite showing these impacts.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.060]   And I think you're reading about it in the press
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.620]   more and more as well.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.580]   So I think Matthew was wrong
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.980]   that it's not impacting their behavior.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.540]   It's not cutting them out from capital,
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.060]   but it is impacting their behavior.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.820]   - Okay, so the last question that we have time for today,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.220]   it's all been very interesting.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.060]   Thank you.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:44.580]   Is that his comments about cost and diversification
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:49.580]   or funds are less diversified and more expensive
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.820]   and may well underperform in the long run,
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.020]   which we already talked about.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.780]   So talk about the cost of doing this and how to do it,
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.900]   which was the last part of your book.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.540]   - Yeah, the costs are, I would say, become pretty reasonable.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.140]   The competition in this space
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.100]   is now like 400 different funds
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.460]   and fund families like Dimensional, Vanguard
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.180]   are having sustainable funds
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.940]   and they are much more lower costs.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.020]   You're probably gonna pay a little bit more
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.340]   to be a sustainable investor
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.460]   because you're paying for the company
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.300]   to make the effort to get the ratings, do the due diligence.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.660]   But we're talking more about 10 to 15 type of basis points,
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.260]   not 100 basis points more.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.860]   And I think people are willing to make that trade-off
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.140]   to be able to express their values.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.940]   So the costs don't have to be great.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.580]   And you can actually build your own sustainable portfolio
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.140]   with direct indexing.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.260]   And because of the technology today, Rick,
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.340]   you and I know 20 years ago,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:56.140]   you wanted your own SMA or separately managed account.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.620]   You probably had a five or $10 million.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.300]   Now you could do it with a few hundred thousand
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.940]   and you don't pay more than, say,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.940]   25 or 30 basis points or so to do that.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.860]   - The name of the book
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.420]   is called "Your Essential Guide to Sustainable Investing"
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.300]   by Larry Swedroe and Sam Adams.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.660]   Larry, thank you so much for being our guest again
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.380]   on "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.740]   - Thank you for having me, Rick.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.620]   Pleasure to be with you.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.620]   - Our next guest is Ellen Quigley.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.660]   She is an academic and a consultant
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.740]   and has a different view.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.100]   With no further ado, let me introduce Ellen Quigley.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.340]   Welcome to the "Bogleheads on Investing" podcast, Ellen.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.220]   - Thank you very much, Rick.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.380]   It's a delight to be with you today.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.140]   - Ellen, I wanted to have you on the program
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.500]   because you and I did a podcast together
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.780]   for the University of California at Berkeley
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.340]   a few months ago.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.820]   And you had some great insights into ESG investing,
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.980]   responsible investing, and such,
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.740]   because this has been your area of expertise
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.500]   as a academic and a practitioner.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.580]   So you have really studied this area
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.300]   and you have some really different ideas about it.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.620]   So could you first tell us
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   a little bit about your background?
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.460]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.820]   So I'm from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in Canada,
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.740]   and I was going to be a historian.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.980]   That was my goal
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.460]   towards the end of my undergraduate degree
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.340]   when I started to become increasingly panicked
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.740]   about the climate crisis.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.740]   And it prompted me to take a pause between degrees
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.340]   that stretched to four years.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.220]   And I worked on local environmental issues
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.100]   before realizing that I was being quite ineffective
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.220]   and perhaps not even deploying
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.940]   the kinds of knowledge and tools
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.460]   that would be useful in a kind of replicability way.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.420]   So then I went back to university
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.380]   with the express goal of learning enough
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.500]   to contribute in a meaningful way,
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.580]   and then gradually stumbled towards finance.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.340]   And once I got there,
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.220]   that's when I started to realize
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.140]   how little any of the accepted tactics
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.660]   actually had any impact.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.540]   - And you ended up getting a master's degree
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.900]   from University of Oxford,
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.380]   and then you went on to get your PhD
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.580]   in economics education from the University of Cambridge.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.260]   That's quite a background.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.020]   - Well, I've been very lucky.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.020]   - Now you are the Senior Research Associate
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.580]   at Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.860]   at the Center for Study of Existential Risk,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.860]   and also a Special Advisor to the Chief Financial Officer
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.500]   at the University of Cambridge.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.020]   So can you tell us a little bit about your current job
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.780]   and this advisor role?
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.660]   - Yes, and I'll just say my comments in this podcast
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.100]   will be in my role as a Senior Research Associate,
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.220]   as a senior postdoc,
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.140]   because I don't want to speak for the university
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.060]   as the advisor to the CFO.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.580]   But basically what I end up doing
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.420]   is spending supposedly half of my time
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.740]   researching these issues,
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.580]   and then the other half of my time
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.620]   working with various officials within the university,
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.980]   including the people who manage the endowments
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.260]   of the 31 colleges at Cambridge as well,
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.700]   putting pressure on banks and fund managers
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.700]   to change their practices.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.820]   And I'll just say that that has been,
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.500]   I feel very fortunate to have such an unusual mix
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.380]   in academia of the pure research
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.820]   and a lot of freedom on that side,
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.140]   and then the ability to test things out
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.980]   in real world environments.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   And also because the Bursars are a uniquely skeptical crowd,
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.300]   they've really helped me think through these issues
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.900]   in the last few years.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.900]   And that's definitely played a big role in the philosophy
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.620]   I've been cultivating in that time.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.940]   - And your philosophy was written out
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.740]   in a paper that you wrote,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.700]   which you submitted to the chief financial officer
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.980]   of Cambridge back in December, 2021.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.740]   So recently called "Universal Ownership in Practice,
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.860]   a Practical Investment Framework for Asset Owners."
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.340]   And I found the paper to be very enlightening,
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   very interesting.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.980]   Let's first talk about the paper itself,
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.460]   because this idea of universal ownership
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.300]   is different than ESG.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.980]   Could you talk about what it is, universal ownership?
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   - In a way, universal ownership is the opposite of ESG.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.940]   Despite, in many people's minds, having the same goal,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.460]   they really end up lending themselves
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.180]   to very, very different tactics.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.220]   So this paper I wrote, the idea behind it
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   is to evaluate the efficacy or lack thereof of ESG.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.980]   And by that, I mean, what are the real world outcomes
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.300]   associated with ESG practices?
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.980]   If you look at the philosophy, the kind of approach,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.940]   ESG is meant to shield an investment, a company,
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.860]   a portfolio from environmental,
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.020]   social and governance risks.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.460]   It's not actually designed to do anything
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.500]   about those risks in the real world.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.220]   And what universal ownership does
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.300]   is it flips things around.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.540]   And it says, "Instead of trying to narrowly protect
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.460]   my own portfolio from something like climate change,"
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.820]   which by the way, surely is impossible.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.100]   I can't imagine a portfolio that you could construct
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.820]   for 2050 that would be somehow immune
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.780]   to the effects of climate change.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.900]   Instead of attempting to do the impossible
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.380]   and construct some magic portfolio,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.340]   a long-term investor of capital,
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.980]   so this could be a retail investor with an index fund,
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.740]   it could be a big pension fund
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.940]   with very long-term time horizon for investing.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.620]   They're going to want to preserve
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.260]   where most of their returns come from,
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.380]   which happens to be the health of the overall economy.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.580]   Most returns come from that,
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.180]   not your ability to outperform the market.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.300]   I mean, this is kind of some of the wisdom
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.820]   behind tracker funds.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.540]   Actually, it just, it recognizes
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.100]   that fees can cut into the big bulk of your returns,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.420]   which is this overall market performance.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.780]   And so what universal ownership does is it says,
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.820]   "What can I do using the tools available to me
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.220]   as an investor to internalize externalities,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.580]   to reduce systemic risks that are created
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.700]   by the companies that I own?"
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.220]   And once you have that philosophy,
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.540]   you use pretty much the opposite tools.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.900]   - Just to clarify, here in the U.S.,
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.020]   the, an index fund or a broad market index fund
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.620]   is called a tracker fund in the U.K.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.780]   'cause it tracks an index.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.220]   So it's a little bit different lingo.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.380]   - Ah, interesting.
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.460]   - Okay, I want to spend some time
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.500]   on the problems with ESG investing,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.580]   because I think that there's a lot of misconception
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.740]   about what it's supposed to do.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.660]   I think that here in the U.S.,
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.740]   it's been sold by the fund providers
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.900]   as having an impact on society
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.500]   and have an impact on climate change.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   In other words, if you don't invest in these companies,
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.860]   if you disinvest from these companies,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.300]   they'll get the message and they'll change
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.500]   because they want you to own their stock.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.140]   Is there any truth to that?
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.740]   - Well, I can't find any.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.620]   Let me just distinguish between two things, though,
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.940]   that's quite important.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.380]   So there are some suggestions
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.540]   that if you are a politically important
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.100]   or legitimate institution
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.580]   and you make a big announcement stigmatizing,
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.660]   say, fossil fuels,
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.940]   the argument there that I think does hold water
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.980]   based on the research behind the divestment report
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   I wrote for the University of Cambridge,
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.060]   I'm now somewhat persuaded
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.940]   that if you have a big announcement
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.460]   from a really legitimate institution,
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.620]   it can help to stigmatize an industry
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.340]   that needs to be legislated
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.860]   and can't be meaningfully legislated
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.140]   until it's viewed as sufficiently bad
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.940]   to invite that legislation.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.140]   So it basically is the precondition
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.420]   to getting the government action that we need
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.660]   is the argument for, say, a divestment announcement.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.860]   But in terms of direct impacts from the sale of shares,
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.740]   most of which, by the way,
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.300]   are not accompanied by an announcement of any kind,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.900]   so there's no stigmatizing effect,
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.020]   I just can't find anything other than
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.300]   either a very momentary blip in share prices
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.180]   that quickly reverts to the mean
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.780]   and actually accompanying the day of the announcement
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.940]   of a very large share sale
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   as opposed to the day of the sale,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.340]   which tells you it's much more about perception
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.500]   than anything else.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.420]   And then there are some stocks,
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.460]   such as in tobacco industry, for example,
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.780]   where there's been a mild depression of share prices
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.380]   over time because it's the longest running
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.980]   excluded industry, basically.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.620]   But even then, it doesn't affect the company's behavior.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.580]   I mean, tobacco companies have continued to sell cigarettes
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.100]   this entire time despite being the most targeted
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.420]   by ESG investors for decades.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.420]   So I can't find the evidence that people would need
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.580]   to conclude that having filters or exclusions
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.500]   on a public equity portfolio makes any difference at all.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.500]   - So most ESG funds are just buying stocks on the market
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:44.220]   or they're excluding stock, divesting stock.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:49.220]   And this is meant, at least in some people's mind,
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.740]   the way it's sold here, as though you're making a difference.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.380]   But in fact, from what you're saying,
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.820]   is if the stock is already out there in the public domain
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.980]   and it's just being traded among different owners,
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.380]   that there is no difference.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.420]   There is no impact.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.700]   - Yeah, and I think it stems from the way that we use
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.740]   the language in this area.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.700]   And I was in this camp as well initially
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.060]   because I didn't know anything about finance many years ago.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.020]   And the term investing, if you think,
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.380]   oh, I'm investing in something,
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.180]   you think you're contributing money to it, right?
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.900]   And I think that's the fundamental misconception here.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.340]   Because if you're investing in Shell or Exxon,
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.820]   Exxon or Shell, they're not getting your money.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.580]   Your money is going to a different shareholder,
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.180]   a now former shareholder.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.060]   None of it flows back to the company.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.740]   They don't care who owns their shares
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.220]   as long as they don't cause trouble in one way or another.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.340]   But there's no evidence to suggest
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.620]   that that composition of shareholders
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.620]   has had a significant effect.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.140]   I mean, the causal relationship between selling your shares
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.940]   and company behavior change,
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.580]   especially anywhere close to the scale that's needed,
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.260]   is just not there.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.580]   - You know, I've always found it strange
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.060]   that the idea that by not investing in a company,
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.460]   you're going to make a change in the company,
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.300]   where I was always learned when I was in business school,
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.820]   that it's the owners of the company, the shareholders,
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.940]   the voters, the people who vote,
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.140]   are the ones that make the difference,
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.140]   not the people who have no affiliation
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.540]   with the company in any way and are not shareholders.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.900]   So this idea of not owning stocks,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.860]   where you're not going to be voting any shares,
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.740]   how can you make a difference?
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.980]   It doesn't do anything for ESG.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.380]   It doesn't do anything to change the world,
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.580]   but it might make you feel better.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.380]   - Yeah, which is actually a bit concerning
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.060]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.100]   One being that the fact that you've invested in an ESG fund
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.860]   almost always means that you've paid higher fees.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.460]   And I actually do subscribe to what Tarek Fancy,
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.300]   the former head of sustainable investing at BlackRock,
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.380]   has said, which is that ESG is a dangerous placebo.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.060]   Because I think that if people think they've done their job,
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.740]   they've invested in an ethical manner,
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.380]   they're likely to just kind of walk away
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:15.220]   from that whole arena of impact as job done.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.500]   And actually, if they're doing something that has no effect,
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.300]   but they've left it alone thinking that it's sorted,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.980]   that's more dangerous, actually,
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.380]   than not persisting in that belief.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.340]   - Hmm, well, let me ask you this,
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.020]   because it's something that I have believed for a long time.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.100]   I've been in the investment business for 35 years,
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.220]   and before there was ESG,
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.220]   there was socially responsible investing.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.060]   Always looked at this
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.140]   and looked at the fees associated with it,
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:47.180]   and never really believed that this was having any impact.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.100]   There is a lot of belief among many advisors
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.900]   that if you didn't do ESG investing,
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.820]   in a typical ESG fund,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.100]   if you just put your money in a broad market index fund
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.820]   that had extremely low cost fees,
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.100]   that you take the fee savings that you get from doing that,
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.220]   and then you donate that to whatever cause you believe in,
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.300]   you'll have a much bigger impact
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.060]   than you would doing ESG investing.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.340]   - I think that's almost certainly true,
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.860]   but I would take it a step further.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.140]   And this is coming from the work of Oliver Hart.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:29.020]   He's provided some really interesting insight in this space.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.020]   He talks about the comparative advantage
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.900]   that a company has in internalizing externalities.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.300]   And that's quite interesting, right?
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.500]   He talks about this case in which DuPont Chemical
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.100]   had the choice of disposing responsibly of some chemicals
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.820]   at the cost of 19 million,
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.900]   or dumping them in the Ohio River,
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.900]   as actually did occur in the '80s.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.700]   And when litigated, they discovered that the cost
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.260]   to the rest of the economy was actually 350 million
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.460]   from that spillage, right?
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.660]   So having prevented it in the first place
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.340]   would have been much better.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.660]   If you think about what charitable donations could do
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.660]   to counteract the effects of things
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.780]   that would have been prevented in the first place,
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.820]   I think you might want to do two things.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.700]   I think you may want to still donate to charities
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.740]   and so on and so forth,
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:21.740]   but I would also make sure to only work with a fund manager
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.020]   who's willing to help actually get those companies
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.460]   to internalize externalities.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.420]   And that's rare.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   Most fund managers are not doing the things
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.980]   that we would need them to do
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.580]   to help move companies in that direction
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.740]   and prevent much greater costs from being absorbed
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.900]   both by society, but also other companies
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.660]   in your portfolio, right?
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.500]   That's the reality of externalities,
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.460]   is that they end up depressing the whole market
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.580]   and that's something that we could prevent
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.900]   as owners of companies.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.540]   - Your paper is on universal ownership.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.100]   So could you describe for us,
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:03.100]   how do you invest with a universal ownership mindset?
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.140]   - It's a really important question.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.460]   I think it's probably one that will still be debated
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.300]   for some time.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.020]   But what is clear is if you're a universal owner,
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.900]   as in you own a little bit of everything,
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.060]   and this can be because you're an individual
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.940]   with an index fund or because you're a big pension fund
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.180]   and you do just kind of automatically
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.940]   end up owning a bit of everything,
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.100]   then you have to worry about the whole portfolio.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.300]   When you look at the entire portfolio,
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.700]   you can't just think about profit maximizing
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.940]   each individual company or holding
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.180]   because that can actually end up hurting
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.980]   the overall performance of your portfolio.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.820]   And I might just use Exxon as an example here.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.140]   If you're a universal owner,
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:51.020]   you may not want Exxon to profit maximize
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.300]   to its fullest extent because that would impose costs
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.140]   on everything else in your portfolio,
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.100]   especially over the long-term
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.740]   because of carbon emissions and climate change.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.100]   And Exxon is actually responsible for something
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.460]   like two or 3% of all historical emissions.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.660]   You can actually attach some real figures
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.300]   to the damage already caused by Exxon
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.860]   across one's portfolio in agriculture
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.020]   and real estate and insurance and food systems.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.460]   You name it, pretty much every sector is already affected
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.220]   and that's slated to increase.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.180]   So if you're a universal owner,
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.020]   you have to think, actually,
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.860]   I would prefer that Exxon adopt a transition approach
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.980]   and every other company to do so as well
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.740]   because even if it costs Exxon a bit more to do that,
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.500]   the overall effect for my portfolio is improved.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.060]   So that's the idea.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.340]   And then practically speaking,
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.780]   how you implement that is you have to think,
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.940]   well, what is going to actually change a company's behavior?
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.220]   And we've already talked about how selling
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.700]   that company's shares in the secondary market
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.220]   probably isn't going to have an effect.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.380]   So what do you do instead?
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.940]   Well, a company like Exxon,
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.860]   but when building, say, new fossil fuel infrastructure,
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.940]   a fossil fuel company will probably raise debt.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.540]   In fact, that's how a very large majority
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.860]   of new capital for fossil fuels is raised, through debt.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.060]   About 90% is the approximate estimate.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.420]   And that comes from loans and from debt issues, bonds.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.180]   And that means that actually a big focus,
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.220]   if you're a universal owner,
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.460]   should be on what banks are financing
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:35.100]   because it's not a very large proportion
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.780]   of their loan book that will be dedicated
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.060]   to something like fossil fuels,
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.780]   but the impact will be huge and systemic.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.060]   So that's a good target for the types of engagements
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.340]   that you may want to have as an investor.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.540]   I just want to understand what exactly you're saying.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.260]   You're saying that the way to have an impact
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.180]   on company's behavior is when they need money.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.020]   Yes.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.740]   And when they're trying to raise money.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.580]   Yes.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.980]   And that's when you bring up these issues
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.620]   as a potential investor?
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.460]   Yes.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.140]   And why that's as important is that there are some studies
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.020]   to suggest that, let's say you're a company
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.100]   wanting to raise debt with a bond issue,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.180]   you can raise more money and at a better price
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.700]   if you have lots of demand.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.220]   And the inverse is also true.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.460]   If you don't have sufficient demand,
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.220]   you're going to be able to raise less money
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.700]   and at a higher cost.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.940]   And the same is actually true for initial public offerings.
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.420]   That's when a company goes onto the stock market
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.580]   for the first time.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.700]   The same thing is true.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.100]   If you have a lot of demand,
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.940]   you can raise more money and at a better price.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.820]   So this is the reason that it's so important
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.660]   to look at primary market investments
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.860]   as those in which you'll have the most direct effect.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.580]   And I like the way you phrased that, Rick,
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.140]   because it's a two-parter.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.540]   One is that probably there are certain companies
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.500]   you should be denying debt to,
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.740]   as in you should not be participating in new issues
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.820]   for those companies.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.340]   But what you're talking about, too,
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   is the pressure that you can actually put on at that moment,
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.100]   the kinds of engagement that you can have
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.260]   when a company is looking for new cash.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.580]   That's a lot more leverage than you might otherwise have.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.500]   And the other big lever as an investor,
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.700]   let's say that you retain shares in this company
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.980]   that you want to change the behavior of
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.260]   and you've denied debt to that company.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.380]   Well, as an owner of the shares,
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.260]   there's been a huge focus on shareholder resolutions.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.020]   Tons of those get filed every year,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.340]   and they tend to be disproportionately
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.460]   about environmental or social issues.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.500]   So they kind of get a lot of the attention of the ESG crowd.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.220]   - Let me circle back to something I said before.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.340]   If you're excluding these companies from your portfolio,
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.500]   then you have no ability to put in
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.620]   a shareholder resolution.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.580]   So it seems like it's counterproductive
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.580]   to not own the stock of the company
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.500]   if now you have no say in the company.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.380]   Unfortunately, the skepticism
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.420]   should stretch a little bit further.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.980]   I now am not sure if shareholder resolutions
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.100]   are that effective themselves.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.580]   There are better tools available to investors in a company.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.020]   So just to say quickly why shareholder resolutions
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.620]   may not always be the best way to go,
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.860]   they tend to be about disclosure only.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.380]   And that goes back to the philosophy of ESG, by the way,
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.460]   because ESG is all about trying to identify
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.260]   the risks to your portfolio
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.980]   so that you can stock pick more effectively, basically.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.620]   So the disclosure of risks is what's useful
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.220]   to someone with that mindset.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:37.420]   But disclosure itself can't be meaningfully connected
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.620]   to actual real world outcomes.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.580]   There are quite a few studies on this,
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.460]   and it's difficult to conclude from those
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.460]   that there's the straight line between improved disclosure
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.420]   and improved environmental performance, say.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.020]   - Are there any other tools,
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.220]   big tools available to investors?
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.500]   - Yeah, I've left the best till last, I guess,
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.900]   which is that if you vote against
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.300]   the re-election of directors,
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.620]   that is probably the greatest power available
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.620]   to an investor in a company.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:11.100]   And there aren't enough studies on this, I will say,
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.740]   and we need more research on it.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.820]   But it does look like you can start to see some responses
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.540]   at the company level long before you actually win that vote,
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.620]   because, and this is the idea behind it,
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.340]   that very high-status individuals
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.540]   who tend to serve on boards are personally embarrassed
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:34.540]   if they have votes against, even to the tune of 10% or 20%,
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.780]   that would be quite a huge embarrassment
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.260]   to a high-status individual.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.580]   And you do tend to see, then,
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.860]   greater company-level responses to that.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.020]   And if you think about what could be deployed
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.660]   in that regard on climate,
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.900]   you could start to imagine that you could do something
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.940]   across whole sectors, saying here is an objective standard
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.460]   that's set by science, and here's what would have to happen
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.380]   for us not to vote against your directors,
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.620]   and do something that applies to a whole sector
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.460]   so that there isn't a disadvantage
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.340]   to those who are decarbonizing on schedule, say.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.260]   It's all about voting against directors and denying debt.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.980]   If I had to pick two tactics as a universal owner,
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.660]   it would be those two things,
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.940]   because they're the sharpest tools in the toolbox.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:30.380]   - Ellen, what type of progress do you think is being made
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:34.940]   in the industry, in the investment management industry,
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.620]   towards this universal ownership concept?
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.780]   - It's a really interesting,
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.540]   I mean, I have to give a depressing response,
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.420]   which I'm sorry to say, it's okay.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.260]   - Sorry.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.500]   - I think we're just, we're not there yet at all.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:58.420]   People are still, at best, in an ESG mindset,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.420]   and I'm hoping that we can see a leapfrog, frankly.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.020]   Because of the pandemic, we have a greater understanding
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.540]   of systemic risks, an instinctive understanding
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.580]   of systemic risks, and I'm hoping that that will allow us
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.580]   to go straight to universal ownership
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.580]   instead of passing through ESG.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.100]   But I also have concerns about the conflicts of interest
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.900]   of very largest fund managers,
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:27.060]   which are trying to bid for the business
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.620]   of the pension funds of these big companies
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.860]   that are contributing externalities to the system.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.900]   So I find it very unlikely that they are going to be
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.020]   the ones to lead the charge, and in fact,
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:42.020]   that has been borne out in terms of ESG adoption as well.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.660]   My hope is squarely on pension funds,
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.100]   potentially some sovereign wealth funds,
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.700]   and endowments, foundations, et cetera.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.100]   I think that's probably where we're most likely to see
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:59.220]   that leapfrogging towards universal ownership.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.780]   - Well, I'm circling back to my ESG fund argument
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.700]   here in the United States, where neither one of those
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.300]   are being utilized by ESG funds here in the US.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.860]   You have no voting power.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:15.100]   The weak one, the resolution, if it even works,
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.260]   you don't even have that option.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.740]   You don't have the option to vote out board members
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.820]   that may have a different viewpoint,
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:25.300]   and since you're just trading equity
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.820]   or not trading equity on the exchange
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.980]   in the secondary market, these funds are not involved
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.060]   in the primary market.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.700]   So there's really nothing of all of your research
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.660]   that actually shows that it might work.
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.100]   Let's talk about one last thing,
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.980]   and that is government involvement.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:46.100]   In your paper, you were very specific to talk about
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:50.220]   one way you could really make change
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.820]   is through laws and regulations.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.660]   From an ESG investing standpoint,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.740]   I mean, maybe there is something going on here
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.260]   in the United States where politicians
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.180]   are becoming more aware of,
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.580]   a lot of people are investing via ESG,
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.540]   so maybe they're becoming more aware of this,
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.820]   and maybe that is influencing at least what they talk about
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.900]   in Washington.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.180]   Could you talk about, as far as from the investment level
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.660]   to the government level, how does that shift take place?
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.860]   I haven't seen any studies on this,
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.300]   so I just wanna leave open the possibility
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.340]   that that can help to provide support
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.540]   for government legislation.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.860]   If people see that people are willing to put their money
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.980]   where their values are, whether or not that's misguided
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.340]   or not, as you and I have discussed,
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.140]   that, who knows, that could contribute
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.700]   to a politician's level of comfort
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.460]   with enacting legislation in line
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:47.460]   with those revealed beliefs.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.420]   I'm trying to actually give some reason
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.940]   for people to invest in ESG here in this country
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.260]   who want to, without slamming them too bad here,
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.300]   saying, "Well, look, even though it's not doing anything
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:02.300]   "for your portfolio, maybe by investing this way,
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:07.980]   "maybe it's in the media, you've got fund companies
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.300]   "creating ESG funds left and right
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.260]   "using all different things."
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.340]   I mean, it's in the news, and therefore,
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.180]   it's getting the attention of politicians.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.380]   And is that having some effect?
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.420]   - Yeah, I think it probably is.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.580]   Again, I don't have studies on this,
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.460]   so this is just an opinion, but I think it's unlikely
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:32.220]   that you would see this level of media coverage
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.220]   of a phenomenon without its having any effect
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.860]   on both company practices and politicians' willingness
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.300]   to enact legislation in line with it.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.820]   And I think we are increasingly seeing companies
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.820]   kind of flailing about trying to figure out
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.820]   how to maximize their ESG scores and so on and so forth.
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:54.220]   By the way, I find ESG scores to be problematic as well.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:58.140]   But I think it's unlikely that you would see
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.620]   this level of interest in a phenomenon
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:05.140]   without its having those larger effects.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.740]   - Well, I'm just trying to come up with a reason
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:11.100]   why people would invest in ESG funds in this country.
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.020]   So that might as well be something that we can hang on to.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.460]   Maybe, maybe it's making some sort of a political impact.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.980]   Maybe. - Maybe.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.980]   - Well, Ellen, thank you so much.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.420]   Greatly appreciate your time today
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.380]   and your work that you're doing,
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.180]   and I wish you all the luck in the world.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.020]   - Thank you so much, Rick.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:30.380]   And it's a real pleasure to talk to somebody
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:33.060]   who instinctively gets this.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.220]   - Well, thank you.
