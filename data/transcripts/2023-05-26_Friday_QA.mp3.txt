[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.040]   And on this Friday, as we do on any other Friday in which I can arrange the appropriate technology,

[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.840]   We begin with Annette in North Carolina. Annette, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.540]   Thank you, Joshua, for taking-- for answering these calls. I really appreciate it. I like this setup, too, anyway.
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.720]   I am calling about some tax strategies. I'm 68, and I teach, and I'm trying to figure out how to
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.420]   minimize my taxes or how to create a business with it.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.700]   I have an LLC because I was a contract instructor, but they've made us W-2 employees.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.200]   And I want to keep working, but I'm paying a lot of taxes. And, you know, they say, "Well, have more taken out."
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.640]   I'm doing that, but it's almost to the point where I'm going to just be working for free.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.240]   Understood. What is your current income from your W-2 job?
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.020]   Well, I am retired, so I have a pension, and I'm doing Social Security.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.560]   So my income is about-- with the part-time job, I teach one class online. That's all I do.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.060]   So it's about $97,000.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.600]   Okay, so your income from your W-2 job is $97,000. Is that correct?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.040]   No, my W-2 from my job is about $14,000. And then I have a pension and Social Security all together.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   Okay, so $14,000 from the job. How much is your pension income?
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.680]   $55,000.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.880]   And how much is your Social Security?
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.260]   $32,000.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.600]   Okay. And in addition to that, do you have other sources of income from the business?
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.360]   Is the business profitable for you?
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   I don't have a business. That's what I'm trying to--
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   I understand.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.840]   Okay, so you previously had an LLC, and you were previously--
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.440]   No, I still have the LLC, but I'm not able to use it because of the tax law in 2017.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.280]   So it cut out a lot of those things that you could deduct.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.960]   So I don't have those business-related expenses anymore.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.400]   And so basically, because I'm a W-2 employee, you're no longer an independent contractor.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.600]   Understood. Okay.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.000]   For how much do you intend to teach for the foreseeable future,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.240]   or do you intend to stop teaching at some point?
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.440]   Well, don't laugh. I think I'm only up to about 9 or 5 plus.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.720]   Okay.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.880]   And I like working, and I'm gifted.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.960]   And so I will be teaching and doing other things.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.160]   I want to create a course and use my teaching skills like that.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   I'm just trying to figure out some things.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.000]   I was approached about teaching for a private school,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.280]   but we figured it out.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.960]   I mean, it amounted to about $12 an hour,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.680]   because I would have to have so much taken out.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.720]   Okay.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.000]   So, by the way, I would never laugh,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.920]   because one of my heroes is Dr. Leila Denmark.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.800]   You ever heard of her from Atlanta, Georgia?
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.440]   I have not.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   Okay. So, Dr. Leila Denmark,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.480]   she was a pediatrician from Atlanta, Georgia,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.040]   and she worked as a pediatrician for almost 75 years.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.000]   She retired at the age of 103 from active practice,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.880]   and she lived till age 114.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.040]   She was one of the first,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.320]   I think she was one of the first women to graduate from medical school in the United States,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.600]   and she had an incredible career, amazing woman.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.360]   My wife was actually a patient of hers when she was a baby.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.680]   My wife's mother took her to Georgia to consult with Dr. Denmark as a baby.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.120]   And so, I'm never going to be the one who's going to laugh at you.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.760]   I think that Dr. Denmark set the appropriate example for all of us
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.440]   of how to enjoy a career,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.720]   how to bring meaning and purpose into the world.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.400]   So, if you're looking for laughter, you're in the wrong place.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   (laughs)
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   So, at the moment, you're planning to teach for the foreseeable future,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.920]   and you have this income.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.800]   What is your current living expenses?
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:30.000]   Um, very low, like, maybe $3,000.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.680]   Do you have the option to suspend your pension payments?
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.400]   Any idea if you have that choice?
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.840]   I don't know. I might suspend the Social Security,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.440]   but with the pandemic, you know, it had everybody kind of, you know.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.920]   Okay.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.560]   So, let me give you the big picture,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.960]   because the frustrating thing is there's not any great answer for you.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.880]   The taxes that you pay are the taxes that you pay
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.480]   for the privilege of living in the United States and working in the United States.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   It just is what they charge you.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.240]   And for living and working in the state that you live and work in.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.080]   There's not a lot you can do in your current financial situation,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.000]   but I'll tell you what you can do in just a moment.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.440]   But just know that there's not a lot.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.120]   And if you continue to teach, even if you are paying a significant amount of taxes,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.560]   that could be a very smart thing for you to do,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.280]   simply because you like to teach,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.000]   and that's something that makes a difference in the world,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.800]   and the burden might be the tax burden.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.160]   So, let's walk through the different options that you face.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.600]   When you are an employee, there are very few things that you can do
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   to reduce your taxes owed, other than to fund retirement accounts.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.400]   So, that should be your first thing, is you should fund a retirement account.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.080]   Does your company offer you access to a 401k?
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.840]   Or a 403d?
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.400]   It does a 401k, but I think the fees are kind of high,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.720]   the last time I checked on it.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.200]   Okay. So, the fees might be high.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.760]   They often are in teaching, especially in the 403b space,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.800]   where they use tax-sheltered annuities that often have high fees.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.840]   So, the fees might be high, but that's the first thing that you could do.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.080]   If you don't need your income, if you are an active employee
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.040]   of a company that has a retirement plan, a 401k,
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   then you can contribute up to all of your income into that 401k.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.120]   And incidentally, you can continue to do this after the age of 70,
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.080]   what used to be 70 and a half, now it's 72.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.960]   So, after the age of which you ordinarily start to receive
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.080]   required minimum distributions,
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.200]   as long as you are working at a company
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   and you don't have more than a 5% ownership interest in that company,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   then you can defer your salary into a 401k.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.360]   And that would be the first thing that I would do.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.760]   So, sign up for your company's 401k plan
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.200]   and defer some or all of your income,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.280]   your earned income, into that account.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.800]   Other than the pension and Social Security income,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.360]   do you have other retirement accounts, such as an IRA?
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:17.800]   No, I have a 401k with my pension job.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.320]   So, an old 401k?
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.880]   Yes.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.560]   Okay.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.200]   What you can do is you can roll your old 401k over into your current 401k.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   You can do the same thing with old individual retirement accounts,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.560]   if you had any of those.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   You can roll those into your current 401k.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.280]   And then you can, as again, as long as you're employed by that company,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.160]   you can continue to defer the required minimum distributions,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.880]   continue to put money in there,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.320]   and that will eliminate the taxes owed on that current income.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.040]   So, that $14,000, if you defer all of it into the 401k,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.800]   immediately goes away from your taxable income.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.680]   You're still left with your pension and your Social Security,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.560]   but at least the $14,000 wouldn't be taxed currently.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.200]   Make sense?
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.720]   Right.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.600]   Okay.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.000]   Now, the second thing that you can do is maximize your deductions.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.360]   So, things like charitable deductions.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.400]   And so, if there's an organization that you want to support,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.640]   or if you're doing something that could be structured as an organization,
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.400]   there's a lot of room, especially if you are a teacher
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.880]   and you want to work in some area of teaching.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.000]   Then, if you want to give away some of the money, you could do that.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.400]   So, you said, you made the statement, you said,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.920]   "All my money is going to pay for,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.960]   basically all my salary is going to pay for taxes."
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   That's not true, because there is no 100% tax rate.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.800]   The highest tax rate...
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   It just feels like it's a lot.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.760]   So, it's not true.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.520]   Right.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.360]   But, you could always just simply...
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.280]   One good way of getting rid of taxes
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.200]   and not giving it to the government is giving it away to charity.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.160]   So, if there's a charity that you want to support
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.720]   and you don't want to pay the money in taxes because you don't need it,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.320]   you can give as much money away to charity as you want.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.000]   And if your itemized deductions, including your charitable giving,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.840]   are larger than your standard deduction,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.880]   and you take itemized deductions,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   then you can zero out your income taxes
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.440]   by giving all your money away to charity.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.960]   So, if you needed zero dollars of income to live on,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.760]   and you gave away the entirety of your income,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.880]   then you would pay no income taxes.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.720]   And the same thing can happen with regard to any portion of your income.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.640]   So, that's something to keep in mind,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.360]   because you sound like you have a desire to keep on working
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.680]   and being involved in areas of education.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   And so, it would be normal for someone in your situation
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.440]   to have contact with some organization or some individual
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.080]   that you think is doing good work.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.880]   And you can support that organization or individual
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.760]   through charitable contributions,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.040]   and you get a discount on those contributions.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.160]   The third thing that you could...
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   Go ahead.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.000]   I think I thought of that because I'm single,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.400]   and so basically you have to go over the $12,000.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.360]   So, I figured for it to be beneficial,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.840]   I would need to probably do about $17,000,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.160]   so that you have 17 minus 12, which is about five.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.520]   Right.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.720]   I mean, that's what I figured.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.320]   Right.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.840]   So, you can sit down...
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.960]   Am I thinking correctly?
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.360]   Yes.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.480]   Do you do your taxes yourself with a computer program, on paper,
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.720]   or do you work with an accountant?
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.640]   I've been doing it myself with H&R Block,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.080]   but I'm going to a CPA and see what they know.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.800]   I mean, I've been to a CPA before, but it's the same thing.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   There's not a lot...
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.720]   So, the frustrating thing for employees,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.040]   there's not a lot that you can do to reduce your taxes
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.080]   other than use retirement accounts.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.920]   So, let's just be clear about that.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.640]   There's no magic.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.400]   I've spent 20 years searching for the magic
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.360]   of how to pay zero taxes.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.520]   I've read all the books.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.640]   I've done all the research.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   I've learned it all.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.200]   And there is magic in some situations,
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.640]   and virtually none of those situations
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.480]   are going to apply to you personally
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.120]   based upon the facts that you said to me.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   So, there are magical options that can apply to other people,
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.840]   but from what you've described to me so far,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.760]   there isn't going to be any magic
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.280]   that's going to apply to your situation
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.680]   other than these options that I'm going through with you.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.960]   So, you can work...
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.680]   If you talk to the accountant, have the accountant show you,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.600]   and you can say, "Let's pretend I give $20,000 to charity,"
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   and then I go ahead and itemize my deductions
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.920]   because of this $20,000 to charity,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.000]   what would my taxable burden be?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.440]   And that's a pretty simple and easy answer to do it.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.520]   If you have the H&R Block software from a previous year,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.640]   or you just go in and meet with whoever did it,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.960]   it's super easy to play with those numbers
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.000]   in a piece of tax software if you have access to that.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.720]   What you said is the normal thing.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.320]   Most people do not itemize deductions.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.360]   And so, until your itemizable deductions
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.600]   exceed your standard deduction,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.560]   that's the only place where this strategy comes into play.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.400]   But if you wanted to give away $20,000 or $30,000 a year,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   you could do that,
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.000]   especially if your expenses are as low as you described,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.760]   of about $3,000 per month,
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.360]   and your income, which is coming in from guaranteed sources,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.040]   is as high as you described,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.200]   then you could afford to go ahead
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.960]   and make charitable contributions.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.680]   And if you put together...
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.760]   If you're giving enough money away,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.360]   you can wipe out a good portion
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.160]   of your tax liability with that.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.680]   - Right, okay.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.720]   So, other than that, I would need to have a business,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.560]   correct? - Correct.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.600]   So, that's where we're going next,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.520]   is, okay, if I have a business.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.880]   Now, here's the problem with, quote-unquote,
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.320]   having a business.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.800]   Could you, in theory, save some tax money
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   by taking business deductions against your income?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.160]   Maybe, but I'd be very surprised
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.520]   if you were the kind of lady who was gonna maximize that.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.440]   So, if somebody is very, very motivated to save on taxes,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.840]   and somebody starts a business
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.920]   that is a hobby kind of business,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.120]   like, let's say I start a business taking stock photography,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.080]   and my business idea is that I'm gonna travel the world
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.680]   taking stock photographs,
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.600]   and I'm gonna travel from my home business destinations,
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.280]   I'm gonna plan a trip to the Bahamas,
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.640]   I'm gonna go and I'm gonna stay at a hotel for one week,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.320]   and the goal of this trip is to take photographs
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.120]   that I'm gonna then list on a stock photography website
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.200]   to create an ongoing residual income source for myself.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.540]   Well, when you get into a situation like that,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.400]   there's a lot of expenses that you can deduct,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.600]   and there's no rule in the IRS tax code
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.160]   that you can't have fun while you're doing business.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.820]   But for somebody who's teaching
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.160]   in a fairly conventional format, what can you do?
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.520]   You could deduct a computer, maybe a microphone,
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.680]   some sort of system like that.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.240]   If you go to a lot of conferences or events,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.640]   you might be able to bring some of those things in
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   underneath your business activities, et cetera.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.520]   But the teaching business is probably not designed
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.240]   to be a really fun business
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.320]   that can maximize your tax deductions.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.080]   And so, while you could run a business,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.920]   you're going to need to actually have a business motive.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.360]   So there's no reason you cannot keep
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.840]   your current LLC, it's fine.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.980]   There's no reason you can't simultaneously work
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.800]   for an employer and simultaneously run a business
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.120]   and use your business deductions through that.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.640]   It's just that the business needs to have a business plan
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.700]   and it needs to be run in a business-like manner.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.740]   You need to be able to demonstrate if you're audited
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.040]   that you're taking prudent decisions
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.160]   with a goal of making a profit.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.340]   And as long as you have a goal of making a profit,
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.720]   if on occasion you have business losses,
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.100]   then those business losses can be used to offset
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.120]   and deduct against some of your other sources of income.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.400]   The challenge is in order to do this legitimately,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.160]   you have to do quite a bit of work.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.880]   And in order to defend yourself in an audit,
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.280]   you need to keep quite a lot of paperwork.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.480]   And I don't want to project upon you,
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.280]   but you've probably reached a point in your life
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.080]   at which you're not overly enthusiastic
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.600]   about doing all of that work, keeping all those records,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.680]   going through all those hoops,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.760]   just in order to save a few thousand dollars of tax money.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.400]   You're probably at a point in your life
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.580]   in which that sounds like a big hassle.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.000]   And just paying a couple thousand dollars
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.120]   is probably a simpler and easier solution.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.680]   So it is an option that can be fruitful,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.860]   but I'm guessing that it's not
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.520]   a really fruitful option for you.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.360]   - Okay. - Okay.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.560]   - All right, actually it's more than a couple,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.120]   but anyway, I appreciate this.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.240]   One last question. - I got one more.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.360]   Yeah, before you go to your last question,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.200]   before you go to the last question.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.920]   - That's not on there, this is about you.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.520]   Did you remember that podcast with the man
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.560]   that helped young guys in his community?
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.880]   It's a really old podcast.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.260]   - I do, yes.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.800]   - What number is that?
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.620]   - Just a moment and I will tell you.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.720]   While I am looking that up,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.580]   let me give you one more discussion though.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.380]   - Okay.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.820]   - I gotta give my brain a moment
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.380]   to come up with the name of the guy.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:33.080]   The fourth option that you can consider
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.300]   that can save on your taxes
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.020]   would be to defer some of your income.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.860]   So if I had caught you before you filed for Social Security,
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.860]   I would love for you to not be taking Social Security
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.620]   until at least the age of 70.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.420]   I don't remember the rules on whether you can suspend it
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.300]   now that you have started it,
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.020]   but I would go to the Social Security office
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.780]   and I would ask them if you can suspend
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.100]   your Social Security payments.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.780]   In addition, depending on what they tell you,
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.060]   you might also consider suspending your pension.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.620]   But probably I don't, now that you've started it,
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.740]   I don't think they're gonna give you
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.620]   an option for suspension.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.140]   So I don't remember the Social Security rules on this
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.080]   and I doubt your pension is going to allow you
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.180]   to suspend it.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.380]   But if you could, there's no reason for you
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.380]   to take extra income from it
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.380]   that you're not required to take
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.500]   under things like required minimum distribution rules
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.740]   if you don't have a clear plan for the income.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.460]   And so you might as well just leave it in the account
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.300]   and then have it for the future
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.480]   when you might have more of a plan for it
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   or have it for a time when you have the ability
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.460]   to leave it to beneficiaries or endow somebody
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.720]   that you want to endow.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.100]   And I found it.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.100]   So the episode that you're asking for is episode 398,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.780]   titled-- - 398, thank you.

[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.540]   I should reach out to him and redo it
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.740]   because that was always one of the most interesting
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.780]   podcast episodes that I did.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.060]   And I would love to get an update with him.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.180]   So it's 398 with Tim Yarborough.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.060]   - Thank you, yeah, it was good, thank you.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.460]   - My pleasure, anything else?
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.940]   - I'm good, thank you so much.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.460]   Have a good day. - My pleasure.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.780]   All right, we go now to Pat in Idaho.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.620]   Pat, welcome to the show.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.980]   How can I serve you today?
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.500]   - Hi, I was wondering,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.780]   I know you've lived in other countries before.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.300]   And I was wondering how you would transfer your US dollar
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.900]   to that country.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.620]   Like what is the most efficient way to do that?
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.340]   - Now for a limited time at Delamo Motorsports.

[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.260]   you're not going to find a better deal

[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.780]   - I would begin with the question,
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.580]   why do you want to transfer your US dollars to that country?
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.480]   So answer that question first.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.100]   - Well, if I decided to live somewhere else, yeah.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.360]   - Are you an American citizen?
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.160]   - I am.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   - Born and raised in the United States?
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.960]   - For the most part, yeah.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.880]   - Okay, and is there any reason you think
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.420]   you would renounce your American citizenship?
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.240]   - I don't think so.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.480]   - Okay, so if that's the case,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.280]   I think that the strongest argument
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.520]   is actually simply in favor
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.720]   of your keeping your financial infrastructure.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.200]   And this is actually a huge benefit
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.560]   of being an American.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.720]   Most people, when they leave their home country,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.420]   one reason they would leave their country
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.600]   would include severing their tax residency
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.280]   in their native country.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.440]   So if you were Canadian, for example,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.760]   and you were planning to move to Thailand,
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.560]   then generally speaking, most Canadians would want
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.720]   to end their tax obligations to the Canadian government
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.000]   by moving abroad.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.920]   Now, the Canadians have some exceptions
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.000]   but often Canadians want to stay enrolled
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.160]   into the national healthcare system.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   And so they actually will work
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.920]   to maintain their presence in Canada,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.960]   in some cases, in order to maintain their enrollment.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   But separate from that, from a financial perspective,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.380]   since a Canadian can completely end his obligation
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.960]   to the Canadian government,
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.160]   then most Canadians want to end their tax residency
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.300]   if they leave and move abroad for good.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.920]   Or another example, and this is Germans, Brits,
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.880]   really almost any country out there.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.040]   So each country has a set of rules
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.560]   of how to end your tax residency.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.100]   In some countries, it's simple,
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.920]   but in most of the advanced Western countries
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.240]   with big tax governments,
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   where most of my listeners come from,
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.600]   those rules are pretty consistent in saying
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.440]   that you need to sever all of your permanent ties
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.680]   with the country.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.360]   So the Canadian would sell his house,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.560]   the Canadian would close his bank accounts,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.300]   the Canadian would close his credit cards,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.520]   the Canadian would, in many cases,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.480]   surrender his driver's license.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.200]   He wants to demonstrate to the government
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.400]   and the taxing authorities, hey, look, guys,
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.180]   I don't have any connection with you guys anymore.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.600]   And by so doing, he can file his exit return
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.040]   and he can never again have to deal
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.640]   with the Canadian taxing authorities
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.880]   as long as he doesn't move back to Canada.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.560]   For Americans, it's completely different.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.080]   For Americans, you always have a tax relationship
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.320]   with the government because the government engages
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.080]   in citizenship-based taxation.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.760]   Americans are taxed no matter where in the world they live.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.960]   There are ways that you can eliminate the taxes
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.040]   that you owe primarily
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.880]   through the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.320]   which allows you to generate income outside of the country
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.000]   and up to a little bit, $120,000,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I forget this year's number, but around that number,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.720]   you can generate that income completely tax-free.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.600]   And then your other sources of income are taxed
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.200]   based upon dividends, capital gains, et cetera.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.000]   But the neat thing for Americans is simply
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.120]   that you don't have to end your relationship
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.920]   with the United States.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.600]   So an American citizen who wants to move abroad
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.120]   could have a mansion in Miami,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.040]   could have all of his bank accounts,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.500]   all of his investment accounts,
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.000]   have everything in the United States.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.480]   And if he qualifies for the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.680]   he will get the benefits of being abroad
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.440]   without severing all of his ties with the United States.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.700]   Now, there is a minor quibble here I need to explain.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.200]   In order to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.840]   there are two tests.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.400]   The first test is what's called a strict days test.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.920]   And if you don't spend more than 30 days
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.280]   inside of the United States,
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.000]   meaning you spend at least 335 days
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.720]   outside of the United States,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.160]   then you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.320]   regardless of your other activities.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.000]   So an American digital nomad can put his backpack on his back,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.440]   can head out of the country,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.320]   and as long as he just doesn't spend time
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.280]   in the United States,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.960]   he's gonna get the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.140]   There is a separate test
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.720]   for the foreign earned income exclusion
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.520]   that allows a little bit more time spent
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.760]   in the United States.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.440]   And that's the center of life test.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.600]   So if an American has his center of life in another place,
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.000]   let's say that that guy from Florida
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.480]   actually moved to the Bahamas,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.840]   and he has a residency permit in the Bahamas,
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.080]   and he owns a house in the Bahamas,
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.300]   and that's clearly where he lives.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.720]   Well, in that situation,
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.920]   he can actually go back to the United States
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.840]   and in theory spend more than 30 days.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.240]   There's no hard limit on it,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.800]   but possibly as much as even four months per year
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   in the United States,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.520]   as long as his genuine center of life
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.760]   is actually located outside the United States.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.480]   And he still qualifies for the foreign earned
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.600]   income exclusion,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.900]   thus allowing him to pay no taxes
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.440]   on his first $120,000 of income, no income taxes.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.520]   And if he works for a foreign corporation,
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.000]   he can eliminate all of his employment taxes.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.040]   But that American can keep all of his infrastructure
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.120]   in the United States.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.920]   He can keep his bank accounts in the United States,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.680]   he can keep his credit cards in the United States,
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.120]   he can keep his retirement accounts in the United States,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.400]   he can get social security,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.040]   he can be enrolled in Medicare,
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.360]   he can get his pension income,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.520]   all of that stuff can stay in the United States.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.240]   And it's immaterial from a tax perspective,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.200]   it doesn't matter.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.720]   And in fact, he could actually keep all of that,
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.320]   even if he renounced his citizenship.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.400]   So Americans who actually go to the point
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.880]   of renouncing their citizenship,
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.000]   they're still eligible for social security payments,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.640]   they can keep their credit cards,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.700]   they can keep their 401ks, et cetera.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.240]   The one distinction is they often
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.720]   are not gonna be able to get any Medicare care
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.800]   because that requires them to be in the United States.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.360]   But in theory, they could in theory
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.320]   possibly work that out as well.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.280]   So with the US government,
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.240]   there's no reason why,
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.380]   even if you leave the United States,
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.960]   you have to move all of your assets abroad.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.640]   So now it comes down to a more careful question of,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.840]   should I move my assets abroad?
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.200]   And if so, why should I?
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.320]   The United States has a world-class banking system.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.340]   Notwithstanding all of the gurus on the internet
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.680]   who wanna say that the United States
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.720]   is the worst place in the world,
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.200]   the United States has a world-class banking system.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.760]   It is a highly sought-after destination
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.160]   for many people outside of the United States
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.720]   to bank, to invest, et cetera.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.840]   Investment products, world-class.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.700]   Low expenses, great markets, everything is great.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.560]   In fact, for foreign investors,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.520]   investing in the United States is phenomenal
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.240]   because you can, depending on what form
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.280]   your income is received at,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.180]   you can potentially make a lot of money
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.840]   completely income tax-free.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.920]   That's for non-Americans.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.680]   But the banking system is really good.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.040]   The credit card system in the United States, second to none.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.120]   The investment system in the United States, second to none
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.560]   for the kinds of products where it works.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.520]   Not to say you might not make a fortune
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.080]   finding some little emerging economies,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.340]   mutual fund in another place.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.460]   There's all kinds of options,
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.560]   but the US system is not something to run from.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.500]   And the US dollar is the global currency of choice.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.160]   So if you're going to abandon
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.520]   one of the world's best banking systems,
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.520]   which you have easy access to,
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.040]   which you have established infrastructure in,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.700]   you need to be intentionally going to something better.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.320]   There are other excellent financial jurisdictions
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.240]   in the world, but you need to be going to one of those.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.560]   And so you don't look at it and say,
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.880]   you know what, I'm gonna go to Mexico,
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.920]   so I'll just go ahead and move all my money
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.080]   from the United States to Mexico.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.600]   You'd be an idiot to do that.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.960]   If I moved to Mexico,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.280]   I would keep every bit of my banking infrastructure
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.240]   in the United States.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.520]   And if I ever opened even a single bank account in Mexico,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.480]   I would open just one single checking account
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.360]   and just put a few thousand dollars in it
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.840]   because there's no need for it.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.560]   In today's digitally connected world,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.940]   when I travel the world,
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.240]   I use my American-based credit cards.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.920]   I have zero transaction fees on them,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.680]   no foreign transaction fees.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.380]   I use several debit cards,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.360]   but I get no foreign transaction fees
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.520]   and I get all of my ATM fees reimbursed around the world.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.480]   So I don't move all of my money outside the United States
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   just because I'm outside of the United States.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.960]   And in fact, I keep the infrastructure in the United States
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.600]   because it's more convenient, it's better,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.240]   keeps most of my money in the US dollar,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.920]   which is where I want it.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.000]   It allows me, and I want it there,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.960]   and I just wanna deal with the currency conversion rate
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.720]   at most transactions because the US dollar
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.060]   is probably the better currency for me to hold long-term.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.360]   Now, where this comes in is,
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.960]   let's say that you're gonna buy a house.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.240]   So you're moving to a foreign country,
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.080]   you're gonna buy a house,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.040]   and you're gonna spend $300,000
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.780]   on a house in another country.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.380]   Well, that's where you need to start thinking more carefully
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.680]   about when am I going to exchange the money?
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.100]   And then depending on the specifics of the country
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.480]   that you're going to,
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.960]   there's going to be a clear answer to your question.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.120]   It's not a matter of,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.760]   well, let me just go to TransferWise and do it.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.920]   That's an option, but it's more a matter of
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.000]   what country am I buying the house in,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.800]   when do I need to open the bank account,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.180]   let me go ahead and when's the right time to do it
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.820]   in advance so I can close on the house
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.780]   in the local currency, et cetera.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.020]   But I would not encourage an American
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.780]   to go and move all of his assets abroad
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.500]   just because he himself is going abroad.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.580]   In the fullness of time,
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.820]   let's just say that you move from the United States
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.580]   to Switzerland, right,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.240]   to pick on a great banking jurisdiction,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.080]   or the United Kingdom, great banking jurisdiction,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.340]   or Singapore, great banking jurisdiction.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.700]   So you've moved there.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.940]   You've lived there for five years,
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.640]   eight years, 10 years.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.020]   You don't ever have any plans
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.660]   of going back to the United States.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.060]   Well then, at that point in time,
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.900]   I would still keep, generally,
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.580]   keep retirement accounts and things like that
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.780]   in the United States.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.220]   But at that point in time,
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.140]   you would go ahead and start moving
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.660]   significant amounts of your assets
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.860]   to the foreign jurisdiction
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.660]   because you're living now in that foreign currency,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.420]   and it doesn't make a ton of sense for you
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.760]   to have all of your money in dollars
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.420]   when in reality, you're living in the Singapore dollar,
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.140]   or you're living in the Swiss franc.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.020]   But even there, I wouldn't move 100% of it.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.740]   I would still keep all the bank accounts open.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.420]   I would still keep all of the credit cards open.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.660]   I would keep all of it open.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.980]   I would just have 80% of my money abroad,
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.780]   and I would treat the accounts in the United States
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.100]   as my foreign asset diversification
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.860]   rather than my primary accounts.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.260]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.900]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.940]   And speaking of the digital world,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.580]   I was wondering if there would be a lot of friction
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.900]   to efficiency loss if you use crypto
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.580]   to convert your US dollar to,
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.280]   let's say, a different currency.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.980]   Is that something that is practiced today?
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.980]   - Well, if you buy Bitcoin at 50,000
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.340]   and you sell it three months later at 30,000,
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.020]   that was a whole lot more expensive
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.240]   than foreign transaction fees.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.300]   So you want to be very careful
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.000]   when you're thinking of buying an asset,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.020]   just like if you buy gold coins
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.080]   and then you carry your money abroad
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.740]   with gold coins in your pocket
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.300]   and you have to sell it and pay a bunch of fees,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.260]   that's very expensive.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.020]   If we're talking about money in the bank,
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.380]   I would just simply search for simple
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.580]   foreign exchange transactions.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.460]   And there would be a couple of ways that I would do it.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.780]   Number one, depending on your level of wealth,
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.500]   you can't beat Revolut, for example, phenomenal.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.100]   Revolut is one of the best
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.960]   modern banking products in the world.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.260]   It's wonderful.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.620]   So you can move your, with Revolut,
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.180]   you can have as many of all the different
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.080]   foreign currency accounts that they hold.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.860]   They give you a great transfer rate on it.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.180]   Really, really wonderful.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.140]   And so for some thousands of dollars,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.180]   I wouldn't trust my life savings to Revolut.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.180]   I don't have any reason to know that they're bad.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.820]   I'm not saying they are bad, but they're new
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.340]   and I don't trust new.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.580]   I'm pretty skeptical of things
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.980]   until they've been proven for a very long time.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.360]   So, but for day to day, for some thousands of dollars,
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.280]   something like Revolut is world-class
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.720]   because you can maintain both.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.240]   So you get a Revolut account,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.360]   you move $10,000 to your US dollar account with Revolut,
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.300]   then you go ahead and convert it into British pounds
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.720]   'cause that's where you're gonna be living
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.760]   and you keep it there.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.860]   And whenever you notice the rate is favorable,
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.040]   you go ahead and make your transfer and it's great.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.100]   So that's great.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.600]   There are transfer wise is very well known
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.720]   in the international foreign currency exchange places.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.520]   And then let's say you can just do a wire.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.240]   And so what I would encourage you is to start with,
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.520]   start by opening a bank account in your foreign bank.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.400]   And if possible, don't commit yourself
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.960]   to transfer the money until you're ready.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.700]   And so frequently what you can do,
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.200]   especially coming from the United States
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.680]   where you're banking in the dollar,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.400]   is you can open a US dollar account at your foreign bank
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.580]   as well as a local currency account.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.020]   And just go ahead and put your money
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.340]   into the US dollar account.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.500]   And then when you are ready to buy the local currency,
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.740]   just do that conversion within the bank
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.180]   and you generally get a pretty favorable rate there.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.980]   So don't go look for schemes like going through crypto
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.580]   or going through gold coins or anything like that,
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.380]   unless you actually need it.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.100]   The only reason I would buy a cryptocurrency
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.920]   was because it's something that I am either speculating on
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.260]   and I believe that it's going to increase quickly
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.820]   or it's something that I want to hold long term.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.780]   Because you have too much of a risk
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.240]   on the fluctuations in value that can immediately wipe out
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.480]   all of any possible savings in terms of fees.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.740]   That help, Pat?
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.780]   - Yeah, yeah, that helps.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.340]   Thank you for giving out some recommendations
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.240]   for converting currency from US
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.580]   to some other foreign currency.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.480]   - Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.360]   What I would say is go slow.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.920]   There's no reason to make big decisions on stuff like this.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.520]   Go and spend a couple years traveling
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.860]   outside the United States
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.680]   before you make any big infrastructure changes.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.280]   Obviously, you'll get rid of your apartment
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.960]   or something like that, but just go slow.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.120]   And then after a few years of traveling
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.480]   and spending time abroad,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.280]   then most of the answers to these questions
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.500]   will be a lot more obvious to you.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.060]   We'll go to Bob in Arkansas.
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:15.900]   Bob, welcome to the show.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.040]   - Really appreciate what you do.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.240]   I found your podcast at the end of April
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.100]   via someone telling me about it
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.840]   and I have been voraciously consuming your past episodes
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.320]   and also just purchased your new course.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.160]   - Wonderful.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.040]   - So I have been a two is, thank you,
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.540]   but I have been a two is one, one is none
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.720]   since about March of 2011,
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.600]   but very new to realizing that,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.800]   that also applies beyond the US.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   So I was working pretty hard on that in the US
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.400]   and various contingencies,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   but just hadn't broadened my aperture to look globally.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.740]   And so I'm kind of looking for some guidance
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.500]   on other countries to look at.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.420]   And just as context, I've been at this for about a year.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.520]   I'm a slow reader and I was really busy up until recently.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.880]   So I started with Costa Rica
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.920]   'cause I'd heard great things about it.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.480]   At the time I was living in Hawaii
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.560]   and I loved Hawaii other than the government and the people.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.500]   And Costa Rica sounded like maybe Hawaii 50 years ago
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.600]   and put a lot of time and effort into researching it
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   only to conclude somewhat recently
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   that they're built on a socialist model
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.440]   and they're running out of other people's money.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.000]   And I may be wrong in that conclusion
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.860]   and feel free to correct me if I am.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.800]   So then I shifted to Panama
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.040]   and I put a lot of research into Panama.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.280]   It sounds promising.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.000]   I've got a trip scheduled in July
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.900]   to go check it out in person,
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.660]   but I have no idea for number three.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.240]   And then also just other places I should be thinking about
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   maybe even for place number two.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.840]   - Okay.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.080]   You said you got my course, you've gotten my newest,
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.400]   let me plug it, howtoretiresuccessfully.com.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.160]   You were talking about my retirement course
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.720]   or my international skate playing course,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.420]   which have you already purchased?
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.680]   - Your international escape course.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.520]   - Perfect, okay.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.640]   - The idea of two is one, one is none,
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.120]   but beyond just the US.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.040]   - Right, okay.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.800]   So my newest course is how to retire successfully
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.720]   and that's available for other listeners
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.320]   who are looking to talk about retirement,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.880]   but that will not be talking about internationalization.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.440]   For somebody who is interested in internationalization,
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.340]   there is no better resource that I can point you towards
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.680]   other than my international escape plan course,
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.400]   which other listeners can buy at internationalescapeplan.com
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   because in that course, I lay out for you
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:49.000]   a thoughtful strategy of how to go about it.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.520]   What I don't do in that course,
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.640]   and I intentionally because it changes so much,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.600]   is I don't suggest any particular country.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.800]   I suggest a phased approach to building a plan
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.200]   that can see you through virtually all bad scenarios
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.600]   that I can come up with
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.720]   by doing a little bit of prior planning.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.840]   And I give a range of options,
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.620]   which range all the way from, you know,
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.240]   have a passport and a credit card
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.040]   and just go abroad as a tourist
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.960]   all the way to the hardcore phase four
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.600]   of moving abroad completely.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.800]   So that's for the benefit of other listeners.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.600]   Now, back to what you said, Bob,
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   why do you think, so let me distinguish,
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.960]   there's a difference between having a backup plan,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.980]   a plan B versus having a plan A,
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.920]   meaning there's one thing for you to say,
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.080]   I'm living in the United States,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   I'm gonna live in the United States,
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.600]   but I really like to have a Panama residence permit,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.580]   so, you know, a bank account down there.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.120]   So if I needed to go, at least I could go there
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.340]   versus I'm going to move abroad.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.100]   Are you looking for a plan B or a plan A?
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.440]   - I'm probably somewhere in between at this point.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.880]   So the more I see of the US,
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.200]   the less I wanna live here
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.360]   in terms of the direction the country's going.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.480]   So initially I wanna find at least a plan B,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.380]   then the goal is to begin spending
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.340]   at least part of the year there.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.060]   And then if I like it enough,
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.100]   you know, that becomes plan A and the US becomes plan B.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.680]   - Understood, all right.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   So I probably wind up discouraging about 80% of people
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.480]   who think they wanna move abroad from the United States,
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.560]   especially people who may be at your phase of life.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.880]   You sound like an adult male
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.640]   who's been successful in life
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.360]   and thinking about what's next.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.000]   You didn't talk about going abroad to get a job.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.840]   Is that right?
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.660]   How old are you?
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.560]   - So I'm 56 and I'm not looking for a job.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.460]   - Okay, so I would generally discourage most people
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:52.460]   in your demographic from trying to move abroad as a plan A
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.960]   because I think the most of the benefits
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.940]   that you're probably looking for are better achieved
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.320]   by moving somewhere else within the United States
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.900]   or by simply doing some traveling outside the United States
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.840]   versus relocating yourself.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.360]   And this is unique to Americans.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.280]   The advice is consistent with advice I give
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.940]   to citizens of other nations,
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.940]   but specifically to Americans, there's some distinctives.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.040]   I kind of feel like if I do my job right,
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.240]   I work really hard to discourage people
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.840]   from permanently moving abroad
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.360]   with the idea that I'm just gonna move abroad
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.120]   and I'm gonna find a dream life in Costa Rica
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.000]   or Panama or wherever.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.640]   If I work hard to discourage you from doing it
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.240]   and you ignore my advice and you do it anyway,
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.560]   then you're one of the perhaps 20% of people
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.320]   for whom that's the right decision.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.520]   But with the other 80% who listen to my discouragement,
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.040]   I've helped you, I've saved you years of frustration
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.960]   and effort by kind of laying out the world realistically.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.840]   - So let me give you,
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.800]   I will give you some countries to consider,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.740]   but let me explain to you why that is.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.440]   You sound like a freedom loving guy
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.000]   and you're a little frustrated about the big government
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.960]   and anti-state trends in the United States.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.940]   Is that accurate to some degree?
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.760]   - I would say that's a vast understatement.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.800]   - Okay, trying to be a little bit politically correct here
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.840]   and inclusive in my language.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.760]   So here's the problem.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.580]   Everything that annoys you about the United States
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.500]   is probably worse everywhere else.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:37.360]   So in the United States, although right now,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.920]   liberty loving people seem to be in retreat
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.880]   and there's a massive growth of nanny state government
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.300]   and intrusive big government, et cetera,
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.600]   you've got 150 million people that agree with you.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.160]   150 million people that think you're exactly right
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.320]   and who are pissed off at the current situation.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.440]   Now you've got 150 million people who are opponents of yours
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.640]   and they happen to have the political power
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.800]   and there's who knows 50 million people in the middle
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.160]   that are the deciding vote.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.080]   But you've got more allies in the United States
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.280]   than you will have in any country anywhere else in the world.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.720]   And I have spent a lot of time traveling
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.880]   and looking for a place that's better.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   And I cannot find a place that is better on everything.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.240]   For any specific issue, you can often find a place
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.460]   that is better for you on that issue.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.600]   But in terms of the totality of the things
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.320]   that probably are important to you
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.480]   because of the kinds of things
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   that are important to me as well,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.440]   you're probably better off with a different region
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.820]   in the United States than you are going abroad.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.880]   So I'll give an example.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.800]   I like Panama.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   I think Panama has a lot to offer.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.400]   I think that, in fact, right now I've been talking
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.760]   with Mikkel Thorup about advertising to my listeners
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.320]   a special event in Panama to go and do a week tour,
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.360]   a special tour for my listeners,
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.600]   limited number of people,
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.200]   and basically have a week tour of Panama
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.040]   and look at the options.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   'Cause I think Panama is a great one-stop destination
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.280]   to set up a residency permit, set up a driver's license,
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.560]   set up a bank account, set up a home even.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.580]   It's easy access.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.840]   It's a great international hub.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.640]   I think Panama has a lot to offer.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.640]   If you were annoyed about COVID in the United States,
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.120]   Panama was 10 times worse.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   In Panama, you could only go out and go to the store one,
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.800]   was it one day a week?
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.040]   And it was separate days for each person of your family.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.640]   And it was based upon the number of your cedula.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.880]   And so you couldn't,
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.320]   it wasn't just that they closed the stores,
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.220]   it was that you weren't allowed to leave your house
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.120]   except one day a week.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.960]   Now, Americans got all upset
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.160]   about the relatively mild lockdowns
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.760]   that various governments imposed, all upset.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.000]   And Americans had the lightest lockdowns
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.680]   of almost any place in the world,
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.000]   except where culturally nobody cared, right?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.960]   Some of the countries in Africa
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.280]   where they just never did anything
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.420]   and the government is not a large, strong, strong government.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.920]   But I mean, Panama, Costa Rica,
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.960]   all these places had crazy requirements.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.520]   And in the United States, things like masking,
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.600]   and I'm just making this as a general thing,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.080]   masking in the United States ended a year and a half,
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.200]   two years before it ended anywhere else.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   If you had been in Panama in 2022, in fall of 2022,
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.440]   and you had the temerity to leave your condo
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.200]   and go into an elevator without a mask on,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.080]   you're gonna be written up
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.400]   and have complaints by your neighbors
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.680]   because they're a big, they're just their culture.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.120]   Now, on the flip side, there are a whole set of freedoms
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.640]   and things that you can get in Panama
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.480]   that you can't get in the United States.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.880]   And so, Panama doesn't impose a ton of taxes.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.000]   You can live in Panama very tax lightly.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.160]   Panama is the world's, I think, second largest purveyor
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.480]   of, or second largest registry of foreign corporations.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.440]   And so Panama is a wonderful place for certain things,
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.880]   but for a guy in your age and stage of life
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.960]   who's looking for a place where it's better,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.880]   you may find it in Panama, but you're gonna,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.280]   once you get there, you're gonna find a whole set of things
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.640]   that really annoy you that are better in the United States.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   And so, and people often don't appreciate that
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.080]   until they've actually gone abroad
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.960]   and spent enough time abroad.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.000]   I myself didn't appreciate that until I had gone abroad
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.520]   and spent enough time abroad.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.360]   And the reason I honed in on your age is this,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.600]   assuming that you've been financially successful,
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.420]   unless you're starting a new business,
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.000]   unless you're something else that you're doing,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.040]   if you just have assets and you're living on your assets
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.000]   and your investments and things like that,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.960]   your tax situation doesn't improve.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.880]   Your cost of living is probably not gonna change that much.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.980]   If it goes down at all, it's only gonna go down
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.320]   in certain categories.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.400]   And so many of the things that people were looking for
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.880]   by the idea of going abroad,
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.400]   I think are better served in the United States.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.840]   And if you don't like the culture around you,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.320]   you can choose a different region in the United States
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.840]   that offers what you have.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.200]   So the reason I'm using COVID is it's recent in our memory.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.840]   But if you think about COVID,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.440]   your experience through the pandemic
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.480]   was drastically more impacted
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.360]   by who the governor of your state was
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.160]   or who the mayor of your city was
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.760]   than who the president of your country was.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.360]   And so in some states,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.400]   they were putting sand in skate parks.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.680]   In other states, the governor said,
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.260]   "Yeah, we're not doing that here."
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.960]   And you had total freedom.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.140]   And it was a state by state basis.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.720]   But you can move among those states
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.200]   and you could probably find many, many more people
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.860]   who fit with you versus in another place,
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.360]   which brings me to the next thing.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.640]   In terms of social life,
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.800]   one of the biggest impacts on your personal life
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.560]   and on your experience of life
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.080]   has more to do with the people that you spend time with
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.380]   and what you consume than anything that's real,
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.560]   anything that really impacts your life.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.880]   And so the benefit of the United States
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.360]   is there's 100 million people that think like you.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.360]   And you can find them
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.320]   and you can surround yourself with those people
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.640]   and you don't generally have to spend much time
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.080]   listening to the people that you disagree with.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.280]   I myself live in a happy little bubble.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.900]   I live in a community of people
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.320]   that pretty much think like I do.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.520]   We're not group think,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.400]   but we kind of share the same values.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.100]   I have isolated myself and my family
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.560]   from a whole lot of the stuff that makes me mad.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.280]   And it's gotten better.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.560]   Now, of course, I don't live in the United States,
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.680]   but my point is I could do it in the United States
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.060]   and I could do it abroad.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.660]   So it's a matter of, more a matter of what you consume
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:46.660]   versus than anything that's real and external.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.160]   So where does a foreign country really come in?
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.880]   Well, if there's something that the country offers
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.120]   from a lifestyle that you really value
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.560]   and you can gain a lifestyle that you want in that country,
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.040]   then it makes a lot of sense.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.520]   So if you really wanna be a surf bum, well, absolutely,
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.140]   but you could be a surf bum in Panama, in Costa Rica,
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.480]   in Nicaragua, and the government doesn't matter that much.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   It's a matter of finding the surfing community
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.040]   and being there.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.320]   If you want the big city experience,
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   or there's a certain thing,
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.480]   like again, certain financial regulation,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.460]   or you wanna live in a zero tax place, okay,
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.280]   well, then you go to that place that's better on that issue.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.000]   But in general, as far as the total package,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.380]   I think that most Americans are excessively critical
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.360]   of their own nation, and they don't understand
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.440]   the many problems and issues that they'll face
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.340]   in another place.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.880]   So what I would recommend is make a list
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.440]   of the specific issues that most annoy you,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.460]   and then think about what countries might give you
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.820]   a better solution on those issues.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.160]   And you may not need to just go abroad,
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.160]   but rather just spend some time in the countries
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.760]   that you like the most.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.800]   So have you ever read, have you yet read,
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.600]   I know you're new to this internationalization stuff,
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.200]   but have you read any of the original stuff
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   by the PT theorists, Peter, what did he publish?
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.520]   Peter Teradish or Grandpa, all the same guy.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.080]   But have you ever read any of the original PT book?
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.640]   - I have not, I've never heard of that before.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.800]   - Okay, have you ever heard of flag theory?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:31.440]   - I've heard of it in terms of oil tankers.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.040]   - Okay, similar concept, but for individuals.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   Let me give you a mini lesson.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.160]   First of all, I gave a lesson in the course
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.760]   that you bought on flag theory.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.960]   It's in, I forget which part it was,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.020]   you may not have gotten to it,
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.960]   but I covered it carefully in the course.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.560]   And so for the sake of listeners,
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.680]   now that I've introduced the topic,
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.820]   let me just cover it because this I think
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.600]   should be your first stop before you try
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.280]   to find one country.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.360]   So it's commonly called a few things.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.960]   Today it's most commonly called flag theory.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:00.660]   Originally it was called PT theory,
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.660]   and PT was created to stand for,
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.580]   was created as a euphemism that people would apply
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.340]   to a bunch of different stuff.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.260]   So PT would stand for perpetual traveler
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:18.660]   or permanent tourist, some variation of those things.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:22.260]   And the basic idea, this was invented back in the '80s
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.060]   by a group of libertarians.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.000]   The guy, I'm blanking on names,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.900]   I hate it when I blank on names.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.820]   The Schultz, the guy who wrote
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.300]   "How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World,"
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.220]   there were about four of them that were working together.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.820]   W.G. Hill was the book, was the pen name
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.440]   that the original book was published under.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.460]   So they created this idea,
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.420]   and there was a bunch of libertarian playboys
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.420]   that were looking around in the '80s and saying,
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.460]   the big government is growing all around the world,
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.300]   what do we do?
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.420]   How do we escape this?
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.340]   And so they started by going around the world
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.220]   and looking for better places.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.580]   And eventually they came to realize
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.820]   that there is no one better place,
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.620]   but rather if we would choose a better place
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:15.380]   for each aspect of our lives, then we can do that.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:19.820]   And so they created PT theory or flag theory.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.860]   And Schultz, Howard or Harry, I can't remember his name,
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.460]   he was one of the original publishers on it.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.580]   And at first it was three flag theory,
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.180]   later it became five flag theory,
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.500]   now there's sites and whatnot.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.140]   You hear people talk about seven flag theory, et cetera.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.980]   The basic idea is you disconnect
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.260]   the different parts of your life
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.260]   and you set them up individually.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.500]   And stick with me because this is really important
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.700]   to my answering your question.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.900]   First flag is usually a citizenship flag.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.640]   So what country do I have my passport from?
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.140]   So do I have a passport from, in the perfect world,
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.100]   you wanna have a passport from a country
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.820]   or a citizenship from a country
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.900]   that's going to give you a powerful travel document
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.020]   so you can travel around the world fairly easily.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.400]   You wanna have a country that's not gonna impose on you
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.360]   any onerous requirements, things like military service
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.460]   or taxes on money earned abroad, et cetera.
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.460]   And basically it's just gonna leave you alone,
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.780]   but you have your citizenship in that country.
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.460]   The second flag is your residence.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.160]   So where is your legal residence?
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.540]   And ideally you'd like to have a legal residence
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.700]   in a country that will let you live there
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.300]   and that will give you all the documents that are necessary.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.760]   Some people might need a tax residence certificate,
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.660]   some people might not,
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.220]   but basically a residence permit in that country,
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.580]   the ability to live there.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.580]   And then ideally they're gonna leave you alone.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.740]   You don't wanna have a country that's gonna tell you
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.560]   you can't homeschool your kids.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.500]   You don't wanna have a country that's gonna tax you
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.700]   on income that's earned abroad, things like that.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:53.700]   The third flag is your banking situation.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.620]   So which you would like a country that serves for you
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.300]   to store your assets in.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.580]   Ideally this would be a country
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.980]   that has a really great financial system,
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.900]   a country that provides you with a good solid place
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.140]   to invest your money.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.540]   Ideally this would be a country that doesn't impose taxes
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.460]   on non-residents so your money can grow without any tax.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.700]   Ideally this would be a country
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.860]   that has favorable asset protection laws,
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.760]   gives you good privacy around your money, et cetera.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.360]   Your fourth flag is going to be your business haven,
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.120]   your business jurisdiction.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.620]   So here you want a country
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.040]   through which you can operate your business.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.280]   A country that ideally is going to have
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.980]   a regularized business environment
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.380]   so you can do things like in the modern world,
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.560]   have good merchant processing accounts,
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.500]   access to PayPal, access to Stripe,
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.440]   access to merchant processing accounts,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.160]   access to good business banking
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.600]   so that you can conduct your business
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.100]   easily in the modern world.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.460]   But ideally this would be a country
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.280]   that's not going to impose taxes on you
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.120]   if you don't live there,
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.200]   that's going to just let you there.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.840]   Or if those taxes are imposed, they're going to be modest.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.240]   Ideally this would be a country that has good laws
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.840]   that protect you as a business owner
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.100]   from fraudulent lawsuits, good privacy laws, et cetera.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.340]   Then your fifth flag is what they used to call
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.440]   your playgrounds.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.640]   And the playground is the place that you spend time
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.080]   that offers you the lifestyle that you want.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.120]   And so for those Libertine playboys,
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.480]   it was what countries, if I want to do drugs,
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.420]   what countries in the world can I do drugs
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.540]   and not worry about being arrested?
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:30.280]   If I want to hire prostitutes,
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.480]   what countries in the world can I hire prostitutes in?
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.580]   If I want to drive my car at 150 miles an hour,
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.120]   where can I drive my car at 150 miles an hour
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.800]   without being arrested?
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.640]   And basically for every lifestyle desire
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.120]   or for every vice, there's a place in the world
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.520]   that you can go where not only is that behavior accepted,
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.680]   but in some cases it's celebrated.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.280]   And so you love to gamble,
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.260]   well go to a place where gambling is celebrated.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.440]   Or you love to shop,
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.680]   go to a place where shopping is celebrated.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.720]   But go to those places as a tourist
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.240]   and spend time in the places that you want to be.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.560]   And so I like to use Europe as an example.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.600]   If you, many people want to be a citizen
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.080]   of the European Union and live in the European Union,
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.200]   that's fine, but I think it's a lot better.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.600]   Go to Europe as a tourist, spend three months there,
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.800]   buy what you want to buy.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.380]   And when you're on your way out in the airport,
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.880]   you can get all of your VAT tax refunded to you
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.500]   as a tourist for whatever you bought.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.940]   And so you can enjoy the European lifestyle,
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.640]   but you don't have to pay European taxes on anything.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.060]   You know, no European income taxes,
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.840]   no European socialized medicine taxes,
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.780]   no European VAT taxes.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.240]   It's basically all refunded to you on your way out
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.760]   as long as you come in as a tourist.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.040]   So when I was an aspiring libertarian
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   who was annoyed with the anti-liberty direction
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.520]   of my native country,
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.720]   and I came across that theory many years ago,
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.520]   I said, "This is probably the best way
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.120]   "that a liberty lover could actually live freely
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.680]   "in an unfree world."
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.960]   And so I started testing it.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.240]   And I'll tell you that it is actually the best way
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:08.080]   I've ever come up with if you care about liberty intensely.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.560]   Now, it's not the perfect lifestyle for a lot of people.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.440]   So it often involves a lot of movement
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.120]   and a lot of people don't wanna move.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.000]   Some guys really enjoy the idea
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.220]   of going to four countries a year
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.080]   for three months in each country.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.120]   You could do it more, you could do it with two,
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.960]   but that's about the minimum number of places
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.760]   you're gonna need to spend time.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.680]   Two places a year.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.440]   Three is better, four can be great.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.420]   So, and that's not gonna work for a lot of lifestyles.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.740]   But if it does work for a lot of lifestyles,
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:37.900]   then you can use that model and lens
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.360]   to consider all the different countries of the world
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.320]   and think about the things that you most like.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   Now, it's harder for Americans to follow this model
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.200]   because of citizenship-based taxation
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.000]   and because of the deep connection
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.680]   that most of us have to our natal country.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:57.760]   And so Americans are, it's very, very hard for us
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.840]   to consider just not doing business
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.960]   with the United States anymore.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.080]   And I don't think it's necessary,
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.980]   as you heard from the previous caller.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.280]   But what is necessary is not to go out
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.640]   looking for the place that is better,
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.480]   but looking for the place that is better
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.860]   on this particular aspect, this particular thing
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.800]   that I'm trying to change about my life.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.560]   And then just go and enjoy that place.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.080]   And in the course that you have,
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.360]   International Escape Plan, by talking about that,
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.360]   I talk about how this is, how you can apply this.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.800]   And you don't need to search for the world's best place.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.360]   You're searching for a place that is good enough
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.000]   or the best on this particular thing.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.080]   So an example with Panama, right?
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.240]   What is great about Panama?
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.560]   Well, what's great about Panama
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.280]   is they have a simple to establish residency program
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.200]   that has very straightforward.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.920]   You can come in, you can gain a legal residency permit,
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.960]   and they have a minimum amount
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.840]   of physical presence requirements.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.000]   So you don't have to go there
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.720]   and spend six months a year there like you do in Canada.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.480]   So Panama is a great option for that part of it.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.660]   Now, do you want to live in Panama?
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.540]   You might, but you would have to check that out
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.580]   and go and spend some time testing it.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.960]   But you don't need to decide that that's the place
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.560]   that you're gonna go and spend all your time.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.960]   You talked about Costa Rica.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.280]   Costa Rica has great things and it has bad things.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.720]   One of the things that's great about Costa Rica
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.120]   is it can be a very welcoming place,
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.600]   especially to foreigners.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.760]   It has interesting flora and fauna, et cetera.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.560]   What's not great about Costa Rica?
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.440]   Setting up a residency permit in Costa Rica
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.920]   is crazy expensive.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.300]   And one of the conditions of setting up a residency permit
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.340]   is that, let me be careful with that crazy expensive,
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.980]   it's more expensive than many other places.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:45.500]   And one of the things that gets most retirees
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:49.320]   they don't realize is a condition of maintaining residency
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.340]   is you have to maintain contributions
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.940]   to the social healthcare system
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.180]   that you're probably never in your life gonna use.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.220]   And so that adds hundreds of dollars a month
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.340]   to maintain this thing.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:00.500]   In addition, you're not gonna get,
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.460]   the shopping is hard, it's expensive.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.160]   It's just nothing like some of the benefits
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.240]   that you get in other places.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.420]   And so Costa Rica can be great,
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:11.140]   but you can access that without ever becoming a resident
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.860]   and go and spend a couple of months there,
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:14.780]   get a little beach place if that's what you like
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.100]   and enjoy that, but you don't have to move all your life
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.180]   and infrastructure there.
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.540]   So forgive the long windedness of my answer,
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:25.040]   but if you understand that, then it can be annoying
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.560]   because I'm not telling you a country,
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.080]   but I'm telling, in fact, if you just want one country,
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.920]   I'm telling you it's the United States.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.120]   That's where you're gonna find probably most
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.560]   of what you're looking for.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:40.360]   But what you can do is create some of those backup plans
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.160]   and start testing them out.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.660]   And then if you find that you enjoy those backup plans,
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:47.700]   then, and you like spending time,
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.200]   then move more of your life abroad.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.440]   But if I'm counseling a guy like you,
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.880]   I would encourage you to do that slowly
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.800]   and strongly encourage you
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.360]   that you will make far more progress
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.500]   on enjoying a free lifestyle.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.640]   If you turn off the TV, you turn off your Twitter account,
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.020]   you turn off all that stuff,
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.600]   you practice a lifestyle of digital minimalism,
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.520]   you surround yourself with community of people
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.040]   that are like-minded to you,
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.320]   and you pick one or two issues that you care about
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.000]   that you might be able to affect in your local area,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.380]   and you spend your time working on a couple of those issues
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.800]   rather than trying to go to another country
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.060]   thinking that it's gonna solve your problems.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:37.720]   - So question for you in terms of localism within Panama,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.020]   in the COVID example that you picked,
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.140]   I have no interest whatsoever in being in a city
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.640]   like Panama City, I'm much more interested
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.240]   in the rural parts.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:52.000]   Do you have, do you believe that the same COVID hysteria
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.440]   prevailed in rural Panama that you described earlier?
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.160]   - Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.840]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.040]   on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.720]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.160]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.040]   you're not going to find a better deal
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.960]   on front row seats to a championship winner.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.080]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.680]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.920]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.440]   - Yes and no.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.800]   So you have a striking, so yes, the same COVID stuff
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.040]   applied in the rural areas because the national government
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.420]   imposed the requirements.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:43.120]   The culture was very different in terms of the culture
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.680]   in the big city versus the culture on the beach.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.880]   Anytime you go to a more rural environment
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   or kind of the beach town vibe, things like that,
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.360]   you automatically get a much more lax culture.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.640]   You automatically get a much more,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.720]   just again, much more relaxed culture.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.480]   So the laws were still there, they were just less enforced.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.920]   But the biggest difference is going to be
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.240]   the difference between you and your American identity.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.440]   That means your general built-in rebelliousness,
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.440]   your general basic annoyance with being told what to do.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.280]   That's not the Panamanian culture.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.880]   Panamanian culture has its own wonderful features,
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.400]   but they don't have a rebellious culture.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.120]   They're not founded in that.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.200]   That's not taught to them from their youth.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.140]   And so yes, you're gonna have more lax enforcement,
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.500]   and some people like that.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.880]   Again, there's lovely areas of Panama.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.560]   You can go to a huge expat hub would be David
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.140]   in that area where it's highland, it's very cool,
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.500]   it's wonderful, there's tons of expats there.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.040]   But then you get into just the question,
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.240]   and by the way, these are things to be aware of,
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.500]   and you won't know until you go and spend time there
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.960]   and see what you like.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.720]   But one of the things is do you want conveniences?
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.960]   David is not a convenient place to live.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.400]   You don't have Amazon shipping everything
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.840]   you could possibly imagine right to your door.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.640]   For one guy, that's a benefit,
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.600]   meaning I can get away from this consumerist lifestyle,
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.000]   I can live a simpler lifestyle,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.760]   I have my buddies, my friends, we live in a simple place,
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.560]   we live a simple life, and it's great.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.740]   For another guy who needs those conveniences,
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.340]   it's a massive downside.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.660]   So you will have to be the one to do that
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.260]   based upon experimenting.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.820]   And my answer to your question thing
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.820]   is go and check out the places that you're interested in,
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.300]   and then see if you like them.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.220]   And you'll know within a month or two
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.220]   kind of the general vibe that you get,
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:47.060]   and there's no reason to go and do any formalities
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.860]   with the government, just go and do tourist runs,
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.840]   do visa runs for a time,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.720]   rent an apartment for a few months,
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.160]   for six months, a year,
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.960]   see if you like spending your time.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   And the people who are the best candidates
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.340]   for genuinely moving abroad and being somewhere else
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.600]   are those who find a local community
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.680]   and a local culture that they really enjoy
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.800]   and really fit in with.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.520]   But I think my hard-won experience from my own testing
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.900]   and a lot of consulting on this subject
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:23.900]   is that Americans significantly overestimate
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.320]   the problems within the United States,
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.680]   and they underestimate the problems abroad,
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.760]   and they get there, and after the emotions settle, et cetera,
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.480]   they realize, you know what,
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.360]   it was actually really good in the United States.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.440]   And because the United States is so huge and so diverse,
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.900]   you can find any climate, any landscape,
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.340]   any community, any culture, et cetera,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.120]   then you'll have an easier time of it
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.280]   relocating within the United States
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.040]   versus relocating permanently abroad.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.300]   Now, quickly to cover my tracks,
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.960]   like in that course that I gave,
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.900]   I gave a long list of here are some things
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.640]   where I would be out of the United States in an instant.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:06.400]   So I think that everyone should have a backup plan,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.640]   because one thing I learned is once,
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.720]   and this was a huge deal for me,
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.760]   I have been in your emotional state.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   My current sanguinity comes from the fact that
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.900]   I don't need to be a US citizen,
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.600]   I don't need to live in the United States,
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   I don't need to have any money in the United States,
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.480]   I could spend the rest of my life and never go back.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.440]   And I've spent the last four years abroad,
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.760]   and so now my appreciation of the country
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.640]   has grown increasingly.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.760]   And knowing that I don't have to be there
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.380]   makes me appreciate it for what it is,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.420]   with all of its benefits and flaws,
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.320]   and be much more relaxed about it.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.080]   So if you haven't put in place any of the steps
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.280]   and you're new to this,
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.840]   then I encourage you put in place the basic steps
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.920]   little by little,
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.720]   but don't bite off the whole thing
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.920]   until you've spent some time testing it out.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:06.360]   - Well, appreciate that.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.480]   I guess one other variable I'll throw in there
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.260]   is I somewhat recently retired from the army,
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:17.260]   and the person I'm with and I were not co-located
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.840]   for 23 years together.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.300]   So we essentially have two houses worth of stuff.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:27.320]   So that stuff is gonna have to go somewhere,
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.280]   or I could just sit there and I can pay a lot per month
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.360]   to just let it sit in storage.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.020]   So in many ways, it behooves us to figure out,
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:41.780]   place B perhaps more quickly than the average person,
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.960]   just because we have a significant cost
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.640]   if we don't take a plan B.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.240]   Any thoughts on that?
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.880]   - Yeah, it's a false choice.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.540]   So with the stuff,
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.720]   you make your own assessment of the stuff,
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.020]   meaning that we all accumulate junk.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.340]   And there's a difference between a guy
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.040]   who's got a machine shop that he works in all the time.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.600]   Like he needs a place for his tools
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.040]   versus a guy who's just accumulated
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.120]   a bunch of random furniture, random stuff.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.680]   So it's not one or the other.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.260]   You can downsize from the two houses
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.860]   into one house in the United States,
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.620]   and you can just get rid of 80% of the stuff
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.660]   that's in house B and move the 20% to house A,
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.580]   getting rid of 50% with what's in house A,
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.100]   and you can have a better lifestyle on the other side.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.700]   I love international living.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.700]   I love it.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.300]   I enjoy so many things about it.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:36.300]   One of my favorite times in my life was recently,
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.380]   couple years ago, I guess technically
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.400]   I still own some cars, but I didn't have,
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.960]   anyway, the cars were all, other people had them.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.380]   I had no cars that I was, although I owned them,
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.840]   other people were all driving my cars.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.080]   So I didn't have to deal with them on a day-to-day basis.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.960]   I had a small storage unit with some personal effects
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.040]   that was just a tiny little storage unit.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.540]   And I was just living in hotels, Airbnb's,
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.880]   just moving around the world with a couple of,
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.080]   with my wife and children,
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.160]   but with just a tiny underseat bag.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.200]   So we could get on any airplane flight, any train.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.040]   I loved it.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.400]   And so my, what reason I'm saying that is,
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.500]   you can do the stuff that you're trying to do
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.900]   and you can get rid of the stuff.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.300]   So your mindset of thinking that you,
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.980]   thinking traditionally of,
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.980]   I have a house in the United States.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.340]   I need to find, I'm annoyed by the United States
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.060]   and I need to find another country where things are better.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.660]   What country should I move to?
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.340]   And then thinking, I'm gonna move to that country.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.560]   I'm gonna get a shipping container.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.480]   I'm gonna load everything up
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.500]   and I'm gonna move all my stuff to that country.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.860]   I think that's a mistake.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.240]   It's a huge amount of costs,
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.440]   it's a huge amount of investment
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.660]   and it's a dumb plan to start with.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.520]   So what I would say is,
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.700]   is your partner still in the army
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.000]   or is your partner also retired at this point?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.400]   - She's retired.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.220]   - Okay, so what I would do is,
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.800]   first get rid of one of the houses,
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.000]   choose the house that you like more
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.840]   and get rid of--
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.940]   - We only have one house.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.200]   - Okay.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.040]   So where's all the stuff is in two locations?
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.160]   - We have two houses worth of stuff and only one house.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.660]   - Okay, so go through and get rid of half of the stuff.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.500]   Like there's just no reason--
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.300]   - I can't, it's not in my possession.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.400]   In other words, other than just telling the army
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.500]   to send it to a dump.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.200]   - Okay, so the army has your stuff stored
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.180]   and the army will ship it to wherever you tell them
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.480]   to ship it, is that right?
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.000]   - Correct, or they will continue to hold it
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.560]   at a certain number of thousand dollars per month.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.400]   - All right.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.120]   How much is the value, the dollar value today of,
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.700]   just a guess, of all the stuff
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.160]   that the army is currently holding for you?
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.280]   If you had to buy it all again,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.640]   how much would it cost you?
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.520]   - Well, and it also has things like pictures
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.760]   and things that are not replaceable.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.600]   - Understood.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.080]   - So that's just the other piece of it.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.560]   But I mean, if it all disappeared tomorrow, I'd be fine.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.280]   I mean, that's the reality that I think you're getting at
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.280]   is if it all burned up in the storage places that it is,
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.040]   my life would go on just fine.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.200]   - Right, okay.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.400]   So then we have personal mementos and personal effects.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.600]   That's not gonna be more than, in the end,
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.780]   a couple of Rubbermaid totes worth
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.720]   by the time you get it all sorted through.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.000]   And the rest of it is just miscellaneous stuff,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.240]   some toys, some hobby stuff, some furniture, utensils,
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.120]   all the normal stuff of living.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.920]   So what I would encourage you to do,
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.560]   and I'm speaking very broadly,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.760]   of course, here in a generalized context,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.240]   and I'm gonna move on here
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.680]   'cause I got three other callers waiting,
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.520]   but what I would encourage you to do
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.520]   is have the army ship all the stuff to your house.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.240]   Host, pull out all of the personal mementos
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.200]   and all of those things, all the personal papers,
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.320]   all the personal mementos, all the personal books,
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.520]   things like that.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.800]   You know you don't need the furniture, et cetera.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.200]   So just post an ad online and sell the furniture.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   Sell it cheap, collect the $4,000 that you have for it,
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.680]   or whatever that is.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   All the stuff, the dishes and clothes and things like that,
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.560]   just get rid of all that stuff.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.560]   Then set yourself a one-month project
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:12.560]   to store digital copies and organize your personal effects.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.960]   And I think if you set it as a one-month project,
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   you're gonna be working hard for a month,
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.500]   but you can get it done in a month.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.040]   So with your pictures and things like that,
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.200]   you can digitize those pretty easily.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.520]   So what I did when I was going through this
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.060]   was I bought a good quality duplex scanner.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:36.000]   The specific one that I have is called a ScanSnap iX500.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.880]   I don't know if that's still the best scanner or not.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.520]   It was at the time, it's a $500 scanner.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.700]   So go and do a little research,
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.700]   get yourself a good quality duplex scanner.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.160]   What a duplex scanner is, it's a device
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.560]   that as you feed things through it,
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.560]   it will scan both sides of the paper automatically,
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.880]   and it'll do about 30 pages a minute.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:02.180]   So just about as fast as a good quality copy machine
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.500]   can spit out copies, it's pretty fast.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.420]   30 pages a minute is pretty quick.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.080]   And so what you can do is you can get all your papers,
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.740]   everything like that, lined up,
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.880]   and just go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.340]   and you can get scans of all of that.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:18.060]   And it can do mixed media, it can scan pictures.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.460]   Those fast scans are not gonna be
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   archival quality of pictures,
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.480]   but that would be something
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.600]   so that you have a digital backup.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.340]   And I'm not encouraging you to get rid
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.380]   of all of the pictures.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.800]   But with all the pictures,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.540]   buy a whole set of giant set of matching photo albums,
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.140]   put all of the pictures and albums
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.460]   so that they'll be stored,
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.780]   put them in big rubber made totes
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.720]   that are gonna be really heavy,
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.220]   but that are gonna be simple to store
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.220]   and keep things out of it,
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.300]   keep them clean and protected, et cetera,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.320]   and then find a place to store that stuff.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.820]   So all your personal stuff.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.780]   If you have a huge book collection,
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.680]   this is work, but what I did
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.980]   was I scanned my entire library.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.460]   That's a big project.
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.780]   It might be premature.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.700]   Books are easy to store.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.780]   They go in books pretty well.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.840]   But what I did was I did destructive scanning.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.760]   I whacked off the spines of all my books.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.740]   I passed them through the duplex scanner
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.420]   and I digitized the entire library
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.780]   so it's on my computer.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.420]   If you need help, just go to the internet
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.080]   about living a paperless life
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.940]   and all this stuff and it's out there.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.500]   There are services that you can hire
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.460]   if you wanna spend money
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.160]   where they'll professionally scan all your photos,
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.460]   provide everything to you digitally.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.980]   Then all that stuff, put it away.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.060]   And then if you have very valuable personal mementos,
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.500]   things that really matter,
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.900]   maximum maybe two storage totes of that stuff.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.900]   Your mother's favorite thing and the other thing.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.780]   Just pack that stuff out.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.780]   Rent out your house.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.700]   Rent out your primary house.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.480]   Find a friend, someone at church
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.620]   or someone in the army who's retiring
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.860]   who needs a year to land somewhere.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.220]   Rent out your primary house
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.760]   so that the house is occupied and taken care of.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.440]   Don't rent it on the open market.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.600]   Find someone who would be trustworthy
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.240]   who just needs a place to live
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.400]   so it covers the housing expenses.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.340]   Load up some suitcases and go travel the world for a year.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.760]   Spend a year on the road
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.320]   traveling to all the different places
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.480]   that you think could be interesting.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.800]   Go spend a month in Panama.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.080]   Spend a month in Costa Rica.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.480]   Spend a month in Colombia.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.760]   Spend a month in Argentina.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.920]   Hop on an airplane, go to Europe.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.960]   Travel around Europe.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.960]   Go to Eastern Europe.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.080]   Go to Western Europe.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.520]   Pop through Turkey.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.380]   Get on an airplane, go to Asia.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.960]   Spend some time traveling for a year or two.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.360]   And while you're on that trip,
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.800]   make careful notes of the things that you like
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.240]   and the things that you don't like.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.920]   And on that trip, spend time with expats,
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.200]   people who have moved there
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.960]   and immigrated to those countries,
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.520]   and find out what they like
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.240]   and what they don't like about the places where they are.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.880]   And then see what resonates with you
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.680]   and see what your experiences are.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.680]   What can happen for you on that trip
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.600]   is as long as you will stop browsing Twitter
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.200]   and stop following the news,
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.360]   is you'll forget about most of what's happening
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.600]   in the United States,
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.980]   and you can just be immersed
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.320]   into a new and very present life.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.820]   And your income should handle that.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.000]   Your finances should handle that,
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.360]   especially if you have whatever expenses you have covered,
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.480]   and you spend a month or two stocking stuff away.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.880]   And you'll come back,
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   and you'll have so much more clarity
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.960]   on your life after that experience.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.600]   You'll have clarity on what you missed
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.560]   about the United States,
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.920]   and you'll have clarity on regions
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.440]   that you wanna explore more.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.720]   And then if at that point in time,
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.400]   you realize, you know what, we really enjoy Turkey,
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.440]   or we really like Colombia,
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.240]   or we really enjoy France, or something like that,
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.880]   then you can go ahead and go farther
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.480]   and go ahead, rent an apartment,
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.840]   ship a pallet of stuff in from the United States
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.360]   that you want, and do that.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.400]   But one of the best things you can do
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.240]   is free yourself from the physical possessions.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.840]   And when you realize how free you can be,
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.160]   it'll add to your sense of mental freedom,
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.920]   political freedom, et cetera,
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.500]   by recognizing I'm not tied down in this one place.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.680]   I don't have to be here,
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.400]   and I don't have to find kind of the world's perfect place.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.680]   It doesn't exist.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.760]   I don't think it exists.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.720]   There are different places
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.240]   that are good for different people.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.600]   But on the whole, you can be very free
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.120]   if you have the legal background
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.880]   that I described with flag theory,
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.480]   and you can be very mentally free
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.920]   if you focus on what you want in your life,
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.960]   and you focus on ignoring a lot of the stuff
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.840]   that you don't want in your life.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.120]   - Thank you very much for your time,
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.960]   and I apologize for confusing your courses.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.240]   As I think about it,
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.920]   I was listening to an older podcast where you announced it,
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.120]   'cause I've been listening to your new ones,
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.600]   and your old ones intermixed.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.440]   - There we go, all good.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.360]   - So apologies for that, that will mix up.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.760]   - All good, my pleasure.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.000]   Check back in in a couple months.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.160]   I'd love to hear from you in a couple months
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.240]   on a Friday call and see how things are going
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.680]   and see what of this advice has worked and what doesn't.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.480]   Sam in Chicago, welcome to the show.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.780]   How can I serve you today?
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.480]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.920]   - My pleasure.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.480]   - I was thinking recently about putting together
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.700]   a digital library, just a personal digital library.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:15.240]   I've heard you talk about Caliber for like your eBooks,
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.800]   but I'm also looking at wanting to archive
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.400]   a lot of the paid subscriptions that I have,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.000]   like premium podcasts and audio books,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   and even things like your courses that you have.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.880]   So like a lot of your older courses
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.880]   are no longer available to be purchased.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.960]   And I'm just thinking about having an offline private
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.920]   library, so I'd like to get your thoughts about that,
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.920]   to what extent you have locally saved content.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.720]   And after you go through that,
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.680]   I'd also like to get your thoughts on,
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.560]   once you have something like that,
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.180]   it could be a pretty valuable asset.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.840]   So how do you think about sharing that
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.080]   with your family, your community,
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.080]   and sort of along those lines?
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080]   - Yeah, it's a big question.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.240]   Let me give you a fairly brief answer.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.720]   And by the way, your call was intelligible,
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.040]   but the audio quality wasn't great.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.740]   It was, it seems like a slow connection.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.740]   So, oops, wrong button.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.640]   Is there anything you can do to improve that
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.240]   while I give you an answer?
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:36.360]   So you can do it, and there's plenty of advice out there.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.040]   I'm not the world's best guy.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.080]   And here's why.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.680]   Over the years, I've been interested in so much stuff,
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.800]   and I consume so much information,
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.880]   and I've tried to archive it all and collect it all,
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.720]   and it creates just this giant issue.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.040]   It's so hard to manage.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.440]   And you say, what for?
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.120]   And I think of it as one of those things that,
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.540]   if I put, am I really gonna access this stuff again?
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:06.520]   And at the moment, I have largely chosen
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.240]   to simply trust my brain.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.400]   My brain can usually give me the answer,
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.040]   and in the times when it can't,
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.600]   with the power of modern search engines, et cetera,
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.720]   I can usually get close enough to my answer.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.960]   So earlier in the call, somebody told me,
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.840]   or somebody asked me the question of what episode was it.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.760]   I couldn't remember what the episode was called.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.600]   I couldn't remember the guy's name.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.360]   It took me a couple minutes to think of it
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.500]   and go and search for it.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.640]   But at the end of the day,
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.440]   it's a lot easier for me to do that
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.760]   versus taking all of my podcasts,
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.440]   having all of them transcribed,
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.080]   and trying to create this comprehensive thing.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.080]   And so I think there's value in just letting stuff go.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.360]   And there's value in not trying to keep everything
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.240]   that you're trying to keep,
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.800]   but just letting stuff go so that you can
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.920]   systematically move on to what's new and what's better.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:01.920]   I do like to have stuff stored, but creating a huge thing.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.240]   I remember a few years ago, I bought a new computer.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.280]   I got a new personal brain software system
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.520]   that I was convinced was gonna be
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.440]   the world's greatest thing.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.960]   I started filling it up, and it's like, why?
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.880]   Why am I doing this?
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.440]   Is this really how I wanna spend my time,
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.680]   or can I just trust myself to learn what I need to know?
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.440]   Even when things are really valuable,
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.960]   let's say that my courses that you've bought
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.760]   are the most valuable things in the world,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.560]   and you learn so much.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.480]   Realistically, and by the way, of course,
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.960]   that's exactly what they were.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.080]   But realistically, things hit you at a certain time.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.320]   A piece of information hits you,
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.800]   and either you do something about it
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.360]   or you don't do something about it.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.080]   And if you do something about it,
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.980]   you got most of the value from the piece of education,
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.800]   and you're probably not gonna go through it three times.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.320]   I'd like to believe that all my stuff
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.640]   was worth going through two times,
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.440]   but realistically, you're not gonna go through something
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.720]   three times, you're gonna grab what's appropriate.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.080]   And so in the information age,
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.600]   when the sheer volume and quantity of information
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.400]   is increasing so much, we have to develop
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.520]   and implement careful filters
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.880]   on the information that we consume.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.160]   And my filter is action.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.360]   So I believe in just-in-time learning,
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360]   not for children, et cetera,
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   but I've had to adjust my own learning style.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.940]   When I was younger, it always served me well to,
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.840]   it always served me well to learn everything,
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.760]   about everything, and try to know everything.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.320]   But it can result in too much learning
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.760]   and not enough action.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.960]   And so over the past years,
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.760]   I've really tried to discipline myself
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.840]   to do just-in-time learning,
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.400]   and to learn towards a specific goal
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.880]   when there's something that I,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.400]   when I can know and articulate the problem.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.120]   And there's a good chance that a lot of the stuff
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.360]   that you're archiving and holding onto,
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.320]   you're not gonna be able to have that there forever.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.320]   So with regard to library management,
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.120]   I digitized my entire library
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.960]   because I wanted to go and travel.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.440]   And I did that.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.240]   I have since repurchased a lot of other books,
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:13.240]   and in hindsight, I would probably keep more books,
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.520]   just because books are relatively,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.280]   they're not super inconvenient to have.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.360]   You can put them in boxes and stick them away somewhere
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.200]   if you don't have shelf space.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.960]   So I would just, and what I've learned is just,
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.400]   I guess I've become less concerned
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.360]   with trying to create complete archives of everything.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.080]   I do have a hard drive that is full of stuff.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.920]   And so if you could do that,
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.440]   my courses, I've always tried to make it
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.280]   so my students can just download it.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.120]   I don't talk a lot about that,
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.800]   but it's always there that you can download it, my stuff.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.160]   I don't put rights management and encryption
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.000]   and anything on it.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.240]   Mostly, I always provide the files
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.520]   so it can be downloaded to your personal archives.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.480]   So if my platforms disappear, you have that.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.480]   And I think because of the inexpensiveness of storage,
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.760]   that it's simple to do.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.200]   And obviously, digital storage is not such a big deal,
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:09.160]   but I think it does still weigh us down,
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.280]   just like physical storage.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.360]   I have a friend of mine who was a massive DVD collector.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.280]   And this guy, a single guy, lots of money,
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.280]   his entire house is a four-bedroom house
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.520]   that's entirely devoted to his stuff.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.840]   And over the years, he just bought so many DVDs,
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.480]   and I find his collections oppressive.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.320]   And I'm like, dude, why do you need all this?
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.680]   Now, of course, I'm a millennial,
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.200]   and just watch it or skip it.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.440]   But I guess what I'm saying is,
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.120]   a lot of it doesn't need to be stored.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.400]   If you are gonna store it, what do you need?
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.280]   Well, I think the answers to it
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.280]   is you would create a RAID configuration of redundant disks.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.440]   I can't remember all of the data on this.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.200]   I looked into this deeply sometime back,
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.400]   but I decided not to do it.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.120]   But you create a RAID system.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.160]   There's software that does it,
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.840]   so you have multiple large hard drives
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.680]   that are put together.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.400]   There's mirrored backups, et cetera.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.120]   You can create a Plex server
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.320]   that has all of your media on it,
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.320]   and you can put that into a system
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.520]   that is indeed quite valuable.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.320]   I have a friend of mine that has a huge,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.800]   he is one of these pack rats, of good information.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.160]   I'm not accusing him of being a hoarder,
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.880]   like of good information.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.280]   He has something like 14 terabytes of information
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.760]   stored on a device, and it's in a Pelican case, et cetera.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.000]   And I have considered making him a five-figure offer
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   to purchase it because a lot of his information
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.260]   is technical stuff, et cetera.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.640]   And there is huge value in it.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.000]   So if you do it, go and look for an array.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.640]   I wish I remembered all the software
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.520]   off the top of my head.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.880]   I could get you that at some point.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.240]   But you would create an actual storage system,
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.660]   and you would do it in a very disciplined way,
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.420]   and it's going to be a significant amount of time.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.480]   So I guess I'm hedging my bets and kind of quibbling here,
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.120]   but on the one hand, move lightly through life.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.520]   You didn't come into the world with anything.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.480]   You're not taking anything of the world out of it.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.760]   Most of what you need to know is in your own brain.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.340]   Don't burden yourself down with trying
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.960]   to archive everything when you're probably
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.800]   not gonna use it.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.000]   A lot of my stuff may be obsolete three years from now,
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.640]   as well as everything else that you did.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.740]   And so the costs, especially, one more comment.
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.440]   I have found, I used to obsess about this stuff
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.480]   because I wanted to be good with money.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.320]   I wanted to be frugal.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.740]   I didn't want to go and purchase another copy
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.200]   of a book that I already owned, et cetera.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.680]   But as you move through life,
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.680]   your financial condition improves
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.960]   if you're focusing on the right stuff
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.560]   to the point where it really doesn't matter.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.520]   So I've repurchased certain books multiple times.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.800]   I had a physical copy of it.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.940]   Yep, that physical copy is gone, or I have it scanned,
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.680]   but I'll go ahead and I'll grab it on Kindle,
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.720]   I'll grab it on iBooks or whatever it is.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.520]   I'll grab the audio book, and it doesn't matter
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.360]   because if something is really valuable,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.240]   so what if I pay $80 for four copies of it?
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.780]   It might not be the most efficient thing,
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.920]   but I'm only doing that when there's 800
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.120]   or $8,000 ideas in there that I need at a certain time.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.440]   And so most of that stuff has become,
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.760]   not a rounding error, I don't want to sound arrogant,
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.920]   but it's just not a big factor to my finances.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.520]   So if I've got premium stuff that has DRM on it,
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.360]   no big deal, I'll just rebuy it somewhere else.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.800]   So those are my thoughts.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.360]   - All right, quick follow-up.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.600]   So how's my audio?
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.240]   - Better now, thank you, you fixed it.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.200]   - Okay, awesome.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.720]   So if I could get you to touch on sort of your view
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.860]   on sharing content as a content creator,
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.680]   if I were to have a library like your friend here with,
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.160]   I could see gathering upwards of 10 to $20,000
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.480]   worth of paid content.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:56.840]   And how would you view offering that as a service?
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.720]   So like, let's see, Herbology, Srinivasan,
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.640]   has a book called "The Network State"
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.080]   and he talks about, are you familiar with that?
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.480]   - I haven't read it, no.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:10.400]   Or I, sorry, actually, hold on, sorry, forget.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.920]   I have a copy of it, I am familiar with his project,
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.600]   I have a copy of it in my files that I have not read.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.680]   So there we go.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.680]   - Okay, so it's kind of like having groups of communities
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:28.040]   that are connected online that would act sort of as entities
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.580]   or like a state would.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:30.840]   And so in something like that,
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.880]   you could have something like a van life community
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.880]   where they're all connected by their hobby of van lifing,
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:43.280]   but there could be certain perks and stuff associated
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.640]   with being a member of the van life state.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.360]   And one of the perks could be being a member
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.400]   of a massive library that's greater than any one
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.440]   of the people could come up with on their own,
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.760]   but it could be sort of a public resource.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.720]   What would your thoughts be if, let's say you found out
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.560]   that like all of your back catalog of courses
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.320]   were in something like that too,
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.040]   not freely distributed on the internet,
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.880]   but in a private library that was shared?
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.400]   - Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.560]   So first, let's begin with the legal perspective.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.440]   What you are describing is illegal under US American law.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.440]   I am pretty skeptical that American copyright law
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.700]   should be how it is.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:35.920]   I'm pretty skeptical of it.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.000]   I don't go deep into it.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.360]   I don't have a thesis ready to present on it,
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.000]   but I don't think that current copyright law,
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.120]   the way that it's applied in the United States
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.640]   is the way that it should be.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.000]   I am opposed to it.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.700]   So if all the copyright laws were disbanded
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.360]   or if they were severely modified,
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.600]   I've never dug deeply into the history
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.180]   of how Disney screwed up copyright law, et cetera,
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.840]   but I think there's enough smoke there for me to think.
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.880]   I'm of the opinion that there's fire there,
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.640]   but I've never dug into it myself.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.720]   But I've read enough essays basically against
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.840]   the concept of modern copyright law
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.960]   for me to be convinced that it probably
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.800]   should be thrown out.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.720]   With regard, I myself, I try to be careful
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:23.240]   'cause I don't wanna get in illegal hot water,
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.520]   but I take liberties on occasion with copyright law.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.640]   I've read far too long of passages from books
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.680]   and things like that.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.620]   And what I always try, the way I myself manage that
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:40.120]   is I always try to think of what I think
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.600]   the intent of the author would be.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:46.960]   And I think that, so if I read,
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.800]   what would be an example?
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.960]   I read extensive portions from "Climbing Parnassus"
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.560]   some months back.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.860]   Here's a book that I clearly took great liberties
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.440]   with the copyright.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.520]   But as I look at it, the book was old,
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.280]   10 years old or something like that.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:06.200]   The book is not a big bestseller or a big seller.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.760]   There's virtually no appeal for these ideas
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.020]   in the modern era.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:17.120]   And so as I see it, I'm trying to spread the author's ideas.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.720]   The author isn't making, it's not a latest greatest thriller
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.240]   where the author's making millions on it.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.200]   The author wrote the book out of a passion for ideas.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.500]   And the author is trying to spread these ideas.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.720]   And I'm trying to serve the author in spreading the ideas.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:35.440]   And so of the tens of thousands of people
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.880]   who listened to some portion of my reading
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.400]   that those excerpts that I did,
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.880]   there are, I'm sure there were hundreds of people
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.360]   who said, you know what, this really resonates with me
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.680]   and went and bought the book.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.200]   And then there were thousands of people
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.800]   who never bought the book, listened to it,
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.200]   and the ideas impacted them,
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.760]   but they never would have read it in the first place.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.520]   And so I don't think the author was harmed in any way
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:05.520]   by my reading extensive portions of his ideas in public.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.960]   I think the author was helped because the ideas are advanced
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.440]   and I would bet that if he were answering the question,
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.280]   he would say, yeah, I'm glad that you did it.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.360]   And I didn't ask him.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.240]   And if he wrote to me and said, Joshua,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.440]   please take this down, I'd be off immediately.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.900]   So back to my stuff, I kind of think of it the same way.
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.840]   I don't worry too much about piracy
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.160]   'cause pirates are losers.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:29.380]   Like people who go out and don't pay for stuff,
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:32.760]   they don't amount to anything, they're just losers.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:35.600]   And I have no interest in, if they get onto my content
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.720]   or they take a course of mine,
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.460]   maybe they won't do that anymore.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.040]   But I mean, they're just pitiful people
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.880]   who don't pay for stuff.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:45.440]   They're losers, they're not able to be successful.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.180]   It's a terrible mindset.
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:52.240]   The idea of not paying people for their contributions
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   in some way is, again, it's a loser mindset.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.360]   But those people who don't pay for my stuff,
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.340]   who find it some, I would guess that some of my stuff
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:06.100]   is out there on some torrent site, et cetera,
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.660]   'cause everything is out there.
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:10.080]   But I don't worry about it for a couple of reasons.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.940]   Again, the people who do that and don't find a way
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.760]   to find the current stuff, they're losers.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.720]   And I figure, hey, if they take my stuff,
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.740]   maybe it'll help them something.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.940]   And at some point, they'll come back
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.060]   and it'll all work out, they'll pay me at some point.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:27.100]   And more importantly, they can't keep up.
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.240]   And so I can produce new, better content
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.060]   far faster than anyone can rip it off.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:37.280]   And they can't keep up with me,
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.600]   they can't keep up with my brain
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.700]   and with my learning and my ability, et cetera.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:43.260]   And if I released a course three years ago
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.820]   and I took it off the market,
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.080]   well, the reason I did it is because the current one
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.540]   is way better and I've made it better.
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:52.860]   And the most valuable thing that somebody has
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.180]   in their life is time, not money.
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:33:00.180]   And so when I was young, I consumed lots of,
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.340]   I had lots of bootleg stuff.
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.960]   I grew up in the era of Napster and whatnot.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.160]   But I guess I still probably have a lot of those files,
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.900]   but I have gone on to spend thousands and thousands
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:14.780]   of dollars with the people who impressed me the most.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:18.660]   And so if I went through the names,
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.940]   it doesn't, these are just digital files
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.700]   that got passed around and I didn't stay a loser
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.460]   who just tried to get free information.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.900]   I used the free information that I got.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.900]   And then I wound up paying those people thousands of dollars
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.140]   and purchasing their other stuff.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.960]   And I'm loyal customers of many people.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.960]   So I don't myself worry about it.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.600]   I wouldn't care much.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.580]   I would just, I don't, I'm not interested
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:44.860]   in spending my time trying to argue
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.360]   over pedantic stuff like that.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.100]   I'm interested in going on building,
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:51.660]   getting better, bigger, et cetera.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.500]   And so I don't have strong opinions on it
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.860]   beyond what I've described.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:57.860]   - Well, that was very helpful.
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:58.700]   Thank you.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.520]   - Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.360]   Anything else?
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.460]   - I think that'll do it.
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.280]   I'll probably call back.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.940]   - Yeah, love to speak to you again.
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:08.220]   And I should spend more time digging
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.860]   into the copyright arguments and whatever
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:11.300]   and to be able to prepare,
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.980]   to have a coherent argument on it,
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.340]   but I've never, I just haven't gotten around to it.
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.460]   Go to the great state of Pennsylvania.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.300]   Welcome to the show.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.300]   How can I serve you today?
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.820]   - Hey, I am a Pennsylvania area code,
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.580]   but I am actually in the great state of Washington.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:25.980]   - Even a better state.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:27.180]   Pennsylvania is for losers.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180]   Great state of Washington.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.220]   That's where it's at.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:32.340]   - I love them both.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:35.920]   So I'm gonna take this into a slightly different direction.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.900]   And I don't know if you've spoken on this before,
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.380]   but sometimes you say, ask me anything.
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.900]   So I'm going there.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:46.740]   This is about family and about keeping my siblings together.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:51.320]   I have two brothers and we are very strongly loyal
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.500]   to one another.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.260]   And now we are facing that time in life
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:00.260]   when our parents are needing some help and are aging.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:04.640]   And so, there are some things coming up
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.140]   for people that are difficult.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.500]   And I just wanted a little bit of advice from you.
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.240]   So specifically what's happening, mom and dad are aging.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:18.340]   Mom probably needs to go into assisted living
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.920]   and dad is mostly fine.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.160]   He'll be fine and that's good.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.660]   I'm trying to get my brothers over the denial of mom is,
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.560]   mom is just fine.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.400]   She's not fine.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.780]   She's had some strokes.
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:34.480]   She has some areas of fine and then some confusion.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.040]   And they don't really want to hear any facts from me.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.680]   There's a dynamic there where my success
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.880]   makes me untrustworthy to them.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.960]   It's a white collar, blue collar thing.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.380]   So there is a dynamic there.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.360]   And I've learned that it's better for me
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.460]   not to try to be expert at anything when I'm with them.
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:58.000]   So, or even nudge toward expertise.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.440]   Hey, go look at these resources, not good.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.500]   So what I said to them was, hey, let's get an attorney.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.180]   I'll pay for an hour and let's just ask them questions
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:10.260]   to see what can happen, which I think is good.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.640]   In response to that, one of my brothers
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.340]   is a little bit concerned about retirement.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:17.260]   He thinks he's gonna do some things with real estate.
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.220]   I think he's gonna be fantastic.
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.820]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:25.060]   But what he did was talk to dad
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.980]   and got dad to change the will
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.420]   and put the house in his name only,
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:32.700]   instead of split between the three siblings,
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:35.020]   which was a backhanded move.
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:36.780]   He kind of did it in a bad way,
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.020]   telling dad he loves the house,
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.400]   but really he just wants to rent the house.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.660]   So I feel like that's like a little bit of a red flag.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:48.140]   And then he talked about maybe having dad
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.380]   transferred into his name to save on taxes.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.780]   Well, that can't happen.
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:55.660]   And I talked to dad and the reason is
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:57.020]   'cause dad needs to live there
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.020]   and it's not gonna be a lot of taxes.
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:02.300]   We're not in a position to have to worry
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:05.040]   about that amount of taxes and all that.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.420]   And what if we transferred into his name
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:13.020]   and he died to rent the house,
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:15.820]   or he gets into a terrible accident
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.420]   and needs a lot of healthcare
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:18.780]   and has to sell his assets,
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.780]   then where does dad live?
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.060]   Like it's a whole,
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.740]   and there's not gonna be a house anyway.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.920]   Probably dad is so healthy,
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:27.060]   if he drops dead, there will be a house.
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.820]   If he has any end of life care,
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:30.820]   that house is gonna pay for it.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.140]   So I briefly talked to dad and gave him,
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:35.340]   I'm dad's advisor.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.100]   First I said, "Dad, am I still your advisor?
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.140]   "I know that was the legal agreement
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:40.620]   "that you asked me to be,"
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:44.380]   and all of the things in his,
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.680]   for healthcare, which I've had to do a couple of times
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:47.520]   and other things,
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.660]   and he said, "Yes."
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:52.200]   And I said, "Well, I just wanted to let you know,
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.940]   "like I know you wanted to give Joe the house."
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:55.780]   And he said, "Yeah."
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:57.180]   He got real fired up.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.520]   And I said, "That's good.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.180]   "I understand, but also maybe don't do,"
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.100]   and I explained a couple of things
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:06.940]   about my concerns about why he should
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:09.140]   keep the house in his name for now.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:12.860]   So dad's on board with that.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.300]   I'm left with the situation
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.080]   where my brother,
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.400]   my brother, I don't know what he's gonna do next,
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.760]   who he's gonna convince of what,
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.360]   and I wanna bring him,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.400]   and he is an ethical person.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.160]   I think he is making a mistake right now.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.200]   I think he might be getting some bad advice
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.500]   from a friend who I haven't met, but I intend to meet.
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:39.720]   And, oh, my earbud is going,
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.480]   so I'm changing earbuds, sorry.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.840]   - All good.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.320]   - Sorry, sorry.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.660]   My earbud, my earbud.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:46.500]   - I know what it's like.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.320]   They run out.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.840]   My count is two hours and 45 minutes.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.000]   That's how long mine lasts.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.060]   So if you're, we're at an hour and 40 minutes
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.180]   into this call, you've been waiting on hold,
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.320]   so it's understandable.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.160]   No problem.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.980]   (laughing)
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.820]   - So that's fine.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:03.220]   So what I'm trying to do,
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:05.460]   so I got the name of a great lawyer,
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.080]   and I told the same brother, I said,
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.520]   "You know, I feel like you will be head of household one day.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.020]   "I want you to think of yourself as a leader of a family
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.260]   "because when the next generation,
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:17.300]   "my kids and our other brother's kids,
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.460]   "as they grow, he's probably,
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.800]   "he's been in a physical labor job.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.880]   "He's always been physically fit.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.100]   "He may live the longest, most likely."
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.340]   So I'm trying to build him up
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:31.620]   into what I see as his potential as leader
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.260]   and try to steer him toward good decisions.
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:37.660]   That to me is the real value here.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.440]   My daughter is great.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.740]   She makes great decisions.
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.900]   She could guide the family if I passed
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.940]   or something like that,
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.740]   but also I'd love to keep everybody together
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.620]   and keep everybody whole.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:52.740]   So I got the name of a great lawyer from a friend that helped
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.440]   and he said, "Oh, I called that lawyer
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.740]   "and never called me back,
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.860]   "but I have a lawyer from my friend."
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:59.500]   So I think it's a friend advising him
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.300]   to do a little underhanded thing.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.660]   So is it really a lawyer?
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.860]   Is it, I don't know.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.040]   So I said, "Okay, let's do that."
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.040]   Make the call, get the call set up.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.200]   So I'm putting it in his bucket to do that,
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.460]   but time is marching on.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.100]   So I may have to take another path myself
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.240]   to get mom in good shape.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.280]   But I still wanna keep this whole thing whole.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.020]   And so then he said to me,
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:33.020]   "Hey, Meg, do you have dad's will, this, this, this,
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.040]   "like the advanced directive,
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.360]   "like all the different things?"
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.900]   And I do, and I'm dad's designated person.
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.140]   Our other brother is mom's designated person.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:44.340]   And we all agreed we would work together
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.460]   to make decisions and to keep everything well.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.080]   And we have a process for that
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.440]   where whoever's in charge makes the final decision.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.820]   And we all support that person
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.300]   'cause mostly worried about my baby brother with mom
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.300]   having like guilt feelings or something,
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.860]   if he should make a decision
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.980]   or having concern that others in the family
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:09.060]   may give him grief, and we're gonna stand next to him
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:11.140]   no matter what he makes the decision.
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.180]   We'll do legwork if he needs it, but we'll stand with him.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:17.540]   But you see, like there's this whole dynamic.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:18.860]   And I think to myself,
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.460]   Joshua is gonna have a really great perspective on this,
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:23.580]   but I don't know if he's been there yet in life
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.820]   to think it through.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.260]   So it's, yeah, okay.
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.580]   - Yeah, one of the benefits of working in this stuff
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.620]   is you accumulate experience.
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:34.980]   When you work in an industry, you accumulate industry far,
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.460]   you accumulate experience far beyond your years.
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.380]   You could be a 25-year-old,
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.460]   you could be a 25-year-old attorney,
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.660]   but if you've worked in divorces,
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:47.820]   you have an 80-year-old life experience
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:52.620]   in terms of relationships and relationship dynamics.
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:54.540]   And that's what has helped me so much
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:58.180]   is working in this, in addition to some personal experience.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:02.100]   So first, I have some more questions I wanna ask,
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.720]   but I wanna just make one thing really clear.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.940]   So let's assume the best about your brother,
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:09.940]   meaning he's a man of integrity, ethics, et cetera.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.820]   He's doing stupid stuff
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:16.460]   because the idea that any father
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:20.500]   should ever transfer a house into his son's name
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:24.620]   while the father is living is dumb from a tax perspective,
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:26.620]   from a legal perspective, et cetera.
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:29.940]   The only reason I could ever think why you would do that
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.100]   would either be some kind of scheme
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:37.100]   to lower the parents' assets for Medicaid planning, et cetera,
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.080]   and that's a dumb way to go about it.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.160]   You're not doing proper Medicaid planning in that scenario.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.760]   Or it's some kind of fraudulent desire
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.500]   to basically steal a house from your parents.
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.920]   From a legal and tax perspective,
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.020]   the most important thing for your father to do
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:53.240]   with something like a house,
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:56.960]   even if he wants to completely inherit that particular son,
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.000]   is for him to own the house until he dies.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.120]   And if he owns the house until he dies,
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:05.520]   then the house as capital gains property
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.140]   will receive a step up in tax basis,
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:12.980]   and the son will receive the house completely tax-free.
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:16.300]   Or alternatively, if he's trying to give the money
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.620]   to his son, don't give the house,
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:20.540]   sell the house and give the money.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.940]   And so even if he sold the house and give the money,
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:26.340]   that itself would be a superior structure
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.420]   from a tax perspective.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.040]   Now, there are potentially a couple of facts
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:30.880]   I didn't investigate.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.180]   I'm not gonna investigate all the details.
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.440]   Maybe your father just owned this house.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.280]   Maybe it has a high tax base, et cetera.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:36.300]   There could be a few things,
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:39.080]   but your brother is doing stuff that's actually dumb.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:42.280]   Like the idea of somebody writing,
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:44.640]   first, let me do a bit more fact finding.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.580]   Has your father and mother lived in this house
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:47.720]   for a significant amount of time?
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.560]   Thus, they probably have a significant amount
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.640]   of gain in the house?
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.120]   - Yeah, well, it's their second house.
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.360]   Mom and Dad kind of live in different houses,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.900]   but honestly, it's in central Pennsylvania.
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.580]   Dad bought the house for $12,000
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:07.260]   and now it might be worth $60,000.
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:10.500]   So we stand to gain hundreds of dollars
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:11.740]   if we go back. - I understand.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:12.900]   - You know what I mean.
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.780]   - So I guess the point is that if your dad bought the house
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:20.220]   for $12,000 and it's today worth $60,000,
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:25.220]   if your dad signs over the house to his son,
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:29.720]   his son inherits a $48,000 of taxable income
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.040]   upon which he owes taxes.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.800]   Now, obviously the numbers here we're talking about
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.780]   are modest, it doesn't really matter,
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.040]   but your son would have to wind up owing a tax bill
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.220]   of $15,000 that he otherwise wouldn't owe
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:43.280]   if he would do something smarter.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.960]   So what could be done?
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.940]   Dad can sell the house,
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:49.680]   Dad will then get $60,000 for it,
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.100]   Dad will get the money tax-free
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:52.480]   because he's lived in the house,
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:56.180]   and then Dad can give the son $60,000 and he can go,
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.880]   or Dad can will the house to the son,
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.580]   and then Dad dies and son receives the house,
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:06.020]   sells it for $60,000 and gets $60,000 tax-free.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.400]   So clearly the numbers are modest,
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:11.800]   but people go out all the time trying to do smart stuff
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:13.040]   that they think is smart,
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.500]   and due to their general ignorance,
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.060]   they don't understand that this isn't
[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.660]   the smartest thing to do.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.820]   So just, he needs to be super careful
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:22.520]   because if his friend is giving him advice,
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.560]   his friend is not giving him great advice.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.240]   So those are the technical tax details
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.320]   on that one particular thing that you described
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.080]   that may be useful to you at some point.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.760]   Now, let's move to the general perspective.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.340]   I wouldn't confront your brother with that information.
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:37.980]   If he winds up running into it,
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:41.400]   or if you can discuss it in a very casual way
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.240]   that he discovers his error, fine,
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.800]   but people don't like to be told they're wrong,
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.800]   and they especially don't wanna be told they're wrong
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.460]   by their fancy-pants sister who makes all this money
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:52.480]   and has this white-collar job, et cetera,
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.160]   and who they have conflict with.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:57.500]   And so that's clearly something you need to be careful of.
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:00.280]   And you're doing really smart stuff, I think,
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.640]   as a woman, and trying to push your brothers,
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.840]   trying to honor them, trying to raise them up.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.880]   Like, this is smart move on your behalf
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:12.080]   in terms of how to encourage them.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.160]   Couple of big-picture things.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.340]   First of all, is your family,
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:17.400]   are the relationship dynamics in your family
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.100]   capable of sustaining a peaceful family meeting
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.460]   with three children and your father together
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.940]   in one room at the same time?
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:29.260]   - I mean, it's possible, but it's also possible
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.660]   that it could go sideways.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:33.180]   And the other thing is they both have,
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.980]   my baby brother has a wife,
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:37.140]   and my younger brother has a fiance
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.580]   who'll get married this year.
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:41.020]   And they have opinions,
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.700]   but they're not necessarily based on fact.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.300]   Like, they're based on emotion,
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.980]   and they want to be heard.
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:52.120]   So we had a third brother, and when he passed away,
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.660]   I did the project, let's call it the project management
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.900]   of the funeral for everybody.
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.340]   I came back, I did all the project management,
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:01.820]   and I brought all the decisions to the family to say,
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:04.300]   what decision would you like to make?
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:06.060]   I did the legwork, here are our options,
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.300]   what decision would you like to make?
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:10.780]   And it so ired everyone that they had
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:13.960]   a little discussion with me about, I have to be in charge.
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.500]   So I said to them, no, I don't have to be in charge.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:20.720]   I loved Tom, and I did the right thing here,
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.000]   but I don't need to even be at the funeral.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.840]   I'm happy to let you all do all of the legwork
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.100]   and make all of the decisions,
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.320]   and I will attend or not attend,
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.960]   and I can be released from this.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.120]   And they were terrified.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:37.920]   So they said, oh, no, no, no, you keep going as you are.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:41.960]   So I started making inroads with having them understand
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.920]   that I'm really not trying to be in charge of anything.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.500]   I am the worker and benefiting from all of my labor.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:53.360]   But we did have one meeting with the women involved,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   and they're wonderful, lovely people,
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.760]   and I love them dearly, but there was no, it was chaos.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.180]   There was no one single topic of discussion.
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.760]   There was no result from anything.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.360]   It was just a lot of people talking at each other
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.200]   around all kinds of topics.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.880]   And that is a therapy session.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.000]   That is not a decision body.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.160]   So I'm afraid that that kind of a thing
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.080]   could happen again too,
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.500]   where people don't have a lot of experience
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:30.560]   in collaborating with other people and understanding,
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:33.800]   okay, I'm only gonna talk if I have something to add.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.240]   I'm gonna give a thumbs up or a thumbs down.
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.960]   I'm gonna state my case if it's different.
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.920]   None of that is happening at all.
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:45.840]   So it could go well or it could go poorly.
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.680]   I don't know.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.760]   I might have to, I might be able to enlist
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:53.680]   one of my sisters-in-law to be a mediator
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.320]   if I can get some time with her and lay it out,
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.760]   but I don't know if that will work or not.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:48:59.600]   I don't know.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.280]   - Yeah, and you definitely face--
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.920]   - If I can get one of them on board.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.120]   - Yeah.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.560]   From what you've already described,
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.160]   you face a danger of building resentment
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:12.320]   for your own personal effectiveness and efficiency.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:15.640]   And there's already some feelings
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.000]   based upon what you described.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.040]   And so you face the danger of increasing that.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.840]   What is the current net worth of your parents?
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.000]   Big picture, just big picture.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.200]   What would you guess is the current net worth
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.040]   of your parents?
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:32.160]   - I would guess it's probably $80,000 or 100,000,
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.680]   very little.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.080]   They have the other house.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:39.160]   They, something terrible happened and they lost it
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.360]   and then they bought it back.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.880]   And I think that, and it just, stupidity reigns.
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.080]   I think that there's probably very little,
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:52.240]   very, very little, if even that much, I don't know.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.080]   - Got it.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.400]   - 50,000 in the one house, maybe a couple thousand
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.120]   in the other, maybe nothing, I don't know.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.480]   - Okay, as far as your personal financial situation is,
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.720]   if you received a one third share of $100,000,
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.480]   would that change your life in any way, meaningfully?
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.320]   - No, and you know what?
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.920]   I would give it up in a heartbeat.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:15.000]   The only, right now, the reason I'm working
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.200]   is to help my niece and nephew get to college.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.040]   - Of course.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.080]   - That's my dream for them.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:19.920]   - Okay.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.240]   - So, if I don't get the money, I don't care.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.080]   - With regard to your two--
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.520]   - I would give, yes.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.840]   - With regard to your two brothers,
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:29.000]   would it change either of their lives?
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.520]   - Yeah, I feel like it would help,
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:35.080]   like the one who wants to do some real estate investing,
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.840]   I think it would help him start with that,
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.640]   get some property started, and the other one,
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.160]   I think it would change his life.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.160]   Maybe he would do something with his family,
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.200]   like, I don't know, remodel his kitchen
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.200]   or something like that, or maybe he has
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.120]   some other dream involved, but I think it could,
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.720]   I think it would be something that would
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.760]   impact them very positively.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.680]   - Okay, so I just want to get clarity,
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:03.440]   'cause it's one thing if somebody has $100,000 estate,
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:06.160]   it's another thing if somebody has $100 million estate.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:08.720]   And so, with $100,000 estate, and with the fact
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.080]   that it's not gonna change your life,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.800]   then we don't need to worry too much
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.240]   about nickels and dimes, we need to worry
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.320]   about maintaining relationships,
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.080]   and I don't think you should just
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.380]   walk away from inheritance.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:21.640]   If you want to receive an inheritance
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:24.000]   and give it away, that's fine, but be careful
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.800]   of just saying, like, I don't want the inheritance,
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:28.040]   'cause that could grow more resentment.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:28.880]   - No, I agree.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.720]   - Right, so I think--
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.560]   - I agree.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.400]   - You should receive that.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:32.220]   - 100% agree.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:33.060]   (laughing)
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:35.400]   - Yeah, it took me a little while to get there,
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.880]   but probably from listening to you,
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.440]   my brain got there, it's like, wait a minute,
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:41.160]   what I really care about is, I really do want
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:44.040]   that blessing from my father, and then
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.920]   if I could bless somebody else and say,
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.440]   you know what, I'm giving it to you,
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:49.640]   that is more honest, yeah.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:51.920]   - Right, and that's something that you could do separately.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.040]   So, it's nice to know that the money
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:57.560]   is immaterial to your life, but you shouldn't
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.080]   volunteer that the money is immaterial to your life,
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.160]   or say to them, oh, I don't need any inheritance.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.640]   It's just a starting point for me
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:04.840]   to understand what we're working with.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.240]   Now, number two, let's divide the issues
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.520]   into two separate things.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:12.800]   So, there's financial, and then there is care
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.000]   of mom and dad, and if I were approaching
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.600]   the situation, I would try to get buy-in
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:23.000]   on a few basic principles, and what I want
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000]   to get buy-in on is the idea that as the children
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:34.600]   of our parents, our duty is to care for them,
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:39.720]   and our responsibility and our corporate desire
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:43.280]   is to see to it that in their final years,
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:48.280]   they are well cared for, that they are well cared for.
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.760]   Just leave it there, and make sure
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.880]   that everyone agrees on that, and I think
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.680]   from what you're describing, everyone would agree.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.320]   Now, there's a lot of talking about what that means,
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.960]   but then if you can get buy-in on that fact,
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:02.480]   that our duty as children for our parents
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.840]   is to care for them, and to make sure
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.880]   that they are provided for and cared for
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:11.560]   to the best of our ability in their final years,
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.800]   and we agree on that, then we can move on
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.480]   to say, do we also agree that the first resources
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:21.120]   that should be used for that are their money,
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:25.200]   that this is their money, they have given us money before,
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:27.560]   they can do whatever they want with their money,
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.400]   but this is their money that needs
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:33.920]   to be provided for their care, and so here's where
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:37.160]   I think most normal people who are not,
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:40.760]   most normal ethical people would agree with that,
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.800]   that the first purpose of our money
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:45.680]   is to care for ourselves. - That's so good.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.640]   Yeah, because my brother, the same brother,
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:51.520]   has this idea that we could get mom into a place
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:54.200]   and then each chip in a couple hundred bucks a month,
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:59.040]   and it covers her, which is just like, it's cute,
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:03.440]   but it's not reality, I mean, even if she's probably
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.000]   gonna be a Medicaid case, and even if that's the case,
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.760]   even if we did chip in a couple hundred dollars a month now,
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   she has had strokes, she's gonna need memory care,
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.160]   and so it goes up to 8,000, 10,000,
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:16.880]   friends of mine are looking at $16,000 a month
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:21.880]   here out in Seattle area, but for mom,
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:26.160]   it might not get that high, but $5,000 or $8,000 a month
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.880]   is certainly more than we're gonna be able to do
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.800]   splitting among the three of us.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:34.360]   So we really do need to think, so my brother has some
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.880]   of these ideas that are just not well-formed
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:41.520]   or not well-informed, which is why I wanna get
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.040]   the right attorney to say, by the way,
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:49.040]   the way it really works is, you know.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.960]   I've tried to get into visit places,
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.160]   I told him a place that she would really love to go,
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:56.480]   where her mother was, and I said, "Why don't we,"
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.940]   I said, "I'm gonna visit there," and he's like,
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.360]   "No, no, no, I'll set up the visit."
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.480]   I'm like, "Great, you set up a visit.
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:04.640]   "I don't even have to be there, I can be, you know,
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.120]   "I can be Zoomed in if I'm not in the same state."
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:08.960]   - Right, right.
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:10.480]   - So I'm trying to get them to understand that,
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:12.400]   but I think that's a key point.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.800]   Their money should be used for that first,
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:17.200]   and that's probably a key point we need to establish
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.160]   with the attorneys, because if we,
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:23.920]   I already have heard that if, say he did sell the house
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:26.400]   or give the house away, and then within five years,
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.400]   needed to go into assisted living himself,
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.060]   if it's a Medicaid case, then that's,
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.320]   within five years, they look back five years,
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.260]   and that something bad happens.
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.520]   I don't know exactly what, but you can't just,
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.920]   you can't just give your house to the kid and say,
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.320]   "Hey, state, pay for me."
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.360]   You know, you really have to use your assets.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.880]   - Exactly, it's fraud, it's fraud.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.320]   They will claw back the money,
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:53.400]   and they will require you to pay the money
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.400]   that was given away within the last five years.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.680]   So it's fraud.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:00.680]   - Okay, and that's what I'm worried about with my brother.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.520]   - Exactly.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.700]   - And that's what I'm worried about with my brother.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:07.240]   Yeah, that he's gonna get himself in like this bad situation
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.920]   that now we have, you know, that he's not really foreseeing.
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.920]   - Right, and again, I would say that
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:15.040]   from what you described about,
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.080]   "Oh, dad can give me the house," he's acting ignorantly.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:22.840]   He doesn't have the confidence, the education,
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.920]   the experience, et cetera, to know the facts.
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:27.720]   He doesn't know how to consult professional advisors
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.780]   or sources of self-help information,
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:34.120]   and he doesn't have the capacity or the experience
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.680]   to understand all of what he doesn't know.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:41.560]   This is the biggest flaw of ignorance in anything,
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:44.240]   especially in finances, is that you don't know
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.480]   what you don't know, and therefore,
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.360]   you don't know the questions to ask.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:51.840]   And this is always, this is the key with ignorance
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.040]   in any field is that we don't know,
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.280]   if we're not experts in the field,
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:56.480]   we don't know what we don't know,
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.800]   and we don't know what to ask,
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.240]   so therefore, we make decisions based on limited information
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:03.560]   and often, if we had more comprehensive information,
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.120]   we would make better decisions.
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:08.240]   And so that's kind of the challenge that he's facing.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.840]   So let me move quickly.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.520]   Number one, I would encourage you
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.280]   to establish with your brothers,
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.080]   and again, this is one of those things
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.360]   where this probably doesn't start with your dad,
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.920]   but if you can talk about it with them
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.880]   and if you can sustain a healthy conversation,
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.120]   I would try to get buy-in on a couple of things.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.320]   Number one, do we all agree that our priority
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:31.840]   as sons and a daughter of our parents whom we love
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:34.960]   and we're good, honest people who love our parents
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:37.240]   and wanna work together, that our priority
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:39.820]   is to do what's best for mom and dad?
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:42.920]   Yes, of course, we wanna do what's best for mom and dad.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.080]   Everyone agrees to that.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:48.160]   And then do we also agree that mom and dad's assets
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:52.000]   should primarily be used to do what's best for them?
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.240]   And we're all hoping that when they die,
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.240]   we get a million dollars, but until that happens,
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.960]   we're going to make sure that all of mom and dad's assets
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.040]   are used to do what's best for mom and dad
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:08.240]   and to provide for them what they need.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:13.240]   And I can't imagine any reasonable moral person
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:16.720]   disagreeing with that.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.600]   It may be through with gnashing of teeth, right?
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.900]   I may just be drowning in debt as a son
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:25.000]   and desperately need money, but I'm at least gonna
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.280]   acknowledge that what I've said is correct.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:32.640]   Then the next thing to do is to create
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.120]   some very simple data points.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.220]   And so what you can do is if you have access
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:40.400]   to your parents' affairs, you need to create
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.740]   a current balance sheet, very simple, right?
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:44.360]   Here's their house, it's house number one
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:47.320]   is worth $80,000, house number two is worth whatever.
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.840]   You need to create a simple statement of affairs
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:52.440]   to understand where they are, and you need to create
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.960]   a simple understanding of what their income is.
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:56.720]   So they have social security, if they have
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.800]   any other sources of income, they need to be understood
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:58:59.800]   what they are.
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.000]   And so because what happens in these family situations
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.600]   is often there's not even understanding of the actual facts
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.880]   because as children, we're all busy,
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.240]   none of us really wanna get involved
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:13.080]   with our parents' lives, we all have our own concerns,
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:15.880]   et cetera, and so if you can create a simple balance sheet
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.960]   of here's the assets that mom and dad have,
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.960]   here's the debts that mom and dad have,
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.760]   here's the income that mom and dad have,
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.940]   and here are their expenses, then at least we can start
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:27.000]   from the same place.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.760]   And what, and your father also, again,
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:34.200]   I don't wanna, people sometimes just through
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:35.520]   no fault of their own, but they don't,
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:36.800]   they're not rational.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:40.360]   So the idea that a guy with $100,000 net worth
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:43.200]   can give away his house when his wife
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.580]   is heading into memory care, and when he himself
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:48.800]   is strong and vigorous and likely to live
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:51.160]   for another 20 years, this is crazy.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.920]   Like, no, you need this $100,000,
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.280]   and it needs to be in the bank so that you have some money
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:58.800]   to buy the things that you need.
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:01.680]   And to me, it will be obvious that if you put that
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:05.680]   on paper, you'll understand that no significant changes
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.720]   should happen here financially.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:10.600]   No big gifts should be made, no anything should be made.
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:12.520]   And the reason you need to communicate on paper
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:16.680]   is to get aligned with the other brother, if necessary.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.840]   Just with the facts, not--
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.720]   - Oh yeah, he's a little bit upset that he was
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:22.320]   like kind of pushed out, and he's like,
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:24.140]   well, nobody asked me about the house,
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:27.320]   and that, you know, and the other brother was like,
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:30.000]   oh, well, and my dad was like, I just started.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.700]   So we will unravel that in time.
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:35.640]   I feel like that's a comma, not a period.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:38.600]   - Okay, do you have, how do you and your brothers
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:41.840]   communicate, do you have a group text message,
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.320]   you know, a WhatsApp group?
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.520]   What do you have, a group text message?
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.960]   - We have group text, and yep, and then I,
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:50.560]   and they're in Pennsylvania, so I visit Pennsylvania,
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:51.480]   I also have a daughter in Pennsylvania,
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:54.400]   so I visit Pennsylvania every couple months,
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.840]   and we sometimes talk on the phone.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:00.000]   And I also individually talk to each of them in email.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.480]   I have a lot of communication.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.320]   - Good, wonderful, okay.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.880]   - And with their wives and with their kids,
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:05.200]   like I keep it all going.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:08.320]   - Good, so you might consider, you might consider,
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:09.960]   with your group text, you might consider
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:12.560]   creating a group text with you, your brothers,
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:14.000]   and their wives.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.320]   You don't need the kids involved,
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.000]   just you, the brothers, and their wives,
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.280]   so that everyone's on the same page.
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.740]   And having their wives in the group, I think,
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:26.040]   can be helpful to minimize some of that
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.360]   brothers against a sister dynamic.
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.280]   It's important to have women and men
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.520]   fully informed of all the facts, et cetera,
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.880]   so they can talk about it with their spouses, et cetera.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.560]   Moving quickly, the next thing I would say
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.440]   is you need to get a clear understanding
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:42.720]   of what is likely to happen with mom
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.360]   and what is likely to happen with dad.
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:49.460]   So if you have, have you already had a professional review
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.640]   by a medical professional of your mom,
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.080]   a report made by a professional, an assessment?
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.400]   - No, but she's clearly in need of help.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.560]   Like, this is pretty clear, yeah.
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.780]   - So it's clear to you,
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:04.480]   but it's not clear to your brothers, right?
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.320]   - Right, right.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:07.920]   - Okay, so you need to commission an assessment,
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:11.320]   a formalized assessment, by a consultant, an expert,
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.240]   a doctor, a memory care, I'm not sure,
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.420]   I don't remember the name to use,
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:18.360]   but somebody, have them assess your mother,
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.120]   create the medical assessment,
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:21.760]   and have the medical professional
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.100]   create a recommended care plan for her.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:25.780]   - Okay.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:28.220]   - And you need to know that as a starting point.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:31.140]   And that needs to be an actual document,
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:32.620]   'cause then now you and your brothers
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:34.040]   have something to talk about.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.940]   If you just give your opinion,
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:37.760]   and your brother's a blue collar worker,
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:39.620]   and he sees your mom once every four weeks,
[02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:41.340]   and like, well, mom doesn't seem that bad,
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:42.860]   but when you're there with your mom,
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:44.080]   you're there with her for four weeks,
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.040]   and you understand all that's happening,
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:48.060]   you need a professional medical opinion
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:50.180]   that you can then take it off of you,
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:52.760]   and you can discuss what the medical advisor says.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:55.820]   And that would be the first thing I would do.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.900]   And then you need to understand what,
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.940]   so based on that medical opinion,
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.420]   let's assume that your mother is heading
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:04.900]   for a memory care unit.
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:07.460]   The next, well, before we go to the memory care unit,
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:09.940]   you need to ask yourself and talk about,
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:13.340]   is there a way that we could provide care for mom?
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:16.580]   And, 'cause this may be something that you could do.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:18.260]   So your brother, for example,
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:20.460]   especially the brother who wants to have the house,
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.720]   it may be the case that he and his wife
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.760]   could provide a high level of good care
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.200]   for your mother and your father,
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.040]   and maybe he would want to do that.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.600]   On the other hand, maybe they have no space,
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.740]   no desire, can't do that, et cetera.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.720]   So I don't, you know, we don't,
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:36.960]   none of us wanna institutionalize our parents,
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:39.760]   and that should be the last resort,
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.040]   although it can be a very necessary step
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.680]   with a severe case of dementia or Alzheimer's.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:48.720]   So you need to understand the options
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:52.320]   and talk about them as based upon the professional report.
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:55.460]   Then with those options, then your next task
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:58.220]   is to bring in professional knowledge
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:00.280]   of the state of Pennsylvania
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:02.420]   with your state's Medicaid laws
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:05.300]   and what paths are available.
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.700]   So I would hire a Medicaid attorney,
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:10.300]   an elder law attorney in the state of Pennsylvania.
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:12.700]   I would describe your parent's situation.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:14.180]   That's where you put down the balance sheet.
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.620]   Here's whose name is on the house.
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:17.960]   Here's the thing, here's whose name is on the bank accounts,
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:18.800]   et cetera.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.280]   What are our options under the Medicaid laws of Pennsylvania?
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.320]   Very clearly, your mother is a candidate for Medicaid,
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:30.320]   and that will happen either by spending down
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.000]   all of their assets, and your father will be left
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.640]   with his social security payment,
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:37.080]   and the assets will be spent down to pay for her care
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:39.400]   in the memory unit if that's where things go,
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.600]   or there may be an ability for you to set aside
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:45.700]   and separate the assets so that he has the house
[02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:46.540]   that he can live in.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:49.420]   I don't know Medicaid law in Pennsylvania,
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:51.440]   but normally he would be able to retain a house
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:54.180]   that he lives in, and normally there would be able
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:56.700]   to be an allowance for his personal effects, et cetera,
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:58.820]   and then your mother would qualify for Medicaid.
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:01.520]   And then your next step after that is to figure out
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:04.820]   can we actually get care in our state
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.340]   under the Medicaid program?
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:08.580]   Just because there's an ability for the program
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:10.980]   to pay for it doesn't mean you can actually get care.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:13.240]   Lots of people who are fully qualified for Medicaid,
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.160]   they can't actually get the care that they need.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:17.920]   And so you'll want to explore the options.
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:21.360]   Medicaid in some cases does provide in-home care.
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:24.520]   And so if you can get some kind of in-home care
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.920]   that is sufficient for your mother's needs
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:28.680]   so that she can stay home with her husband,
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:29.880]   that would be great.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.200]   If you can't get in-home care, understand the facilities,
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.800]   et cetera, all the stuff that you're doing.
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:37.160]   So that would be the process that I would go down,
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:41.580]   and I think that where you can serve your brothers
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:45.700]   will be for you to be really good at what you are good at,
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:49.380]   of presenting the data, the research
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.660]   that you're skilled at collecting,
[02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:54.300]   and then trying to bring it to a family meeting
[02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:56.860]   of what do you all think would be best for mom and dad,
[02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:58.040]   and trying to get agreement
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:00.220]   on these basic foundational issues.
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:03.760]   And if we're dealing with normal, ethical people,
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:07.540]   then the answers will emerge pretty obviously
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:09.340]   from that data that you've collected
[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:11.460]   with the professional assessment,
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:14.500]   with the Medicaid lawyer's advice,
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.100]   with the actual statement of accounts,
[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:18.860]   the actual assets and income of your parents, et cetera.
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:21.340]   The decisions should emerge.
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.640]   The right answer should emerge from that data.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:25.700]   - Totally makes sense.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:26.540]   Yeah, totally makes sense.
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:28.540]   And even if they are good, rational people,
[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:30.740]   we're dealing with emotions here
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:32.740]   that come up in difficult times.
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:35.000]   So having all that rationality
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.120]   and having the women involved too, the wives,
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.560]   I think that will help as well.
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:40.840]   'Cause even if people fly off the handle initially
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:42.540]   or have opinions or something,
[02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:46.020]   cooler heads will prevail in time,
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:48.080]   maybe the next day or something like that.
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:52.400]   And I think it's a fantastic thing
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.200]   'cause one of the wives, her mother,
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:57.520]   will probably be in a similar situation in not too long.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:01.040]   And if I can present a way that, like a path,
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:04.160]   here's what I did, can we do the same thing for your mom?
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:07.160]   To get her set up well,
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.220]   I think that would go over well as well.
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.360]   That might be my angle to get her to,
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:13.720]   not necessarily agree with me,
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:16.920]   but think clearly of her own right
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:19.120]   and come up with her own assessment.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:23.360]   'Cause honestly, she's great in difficult situations too,
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.680]   I've noticed.
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:28.040]   So she has a lot of common sense.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.060]   - If my wife's hand touches my arm
[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.500]   in the middle of a discussion,
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.000]   there is a deep volume behind that simple touch.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.920]   So I think it would be wise for you
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.080]   to bring everyone together in those conversations.
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.560]   - Yeah, it's such great advice.
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:43.840]   Thank you so much.
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:45.680]   Just really appreciate this.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:46.520]   - My pleasure.
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:48.240]   - There's not a lot of people to talk with about this.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:50.120]   - No, there's not, there's not.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.620]   But I think that you're doing the right stuff
[02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:53.720]   and I hope that those steps will help you.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.000]   I think the most important thing
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.520]   is just for you to be careful.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:59.540]   I was gonna ask you, and I'm gonna move on here,
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:01.840]   I was gonna ask about who's older, et cetera,
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.700]   but there's no question that
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:05.840]   when you get into a situation like this,
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:08.200]   the tensions between brothers and sisters
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:10.560]   and the resentment about miss successful
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:13.940]   and male and female dynamics, all those things can be there.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:16.560]   But if we begin by believing the best,
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.400]   we all love each other, we all love mom and dad,
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:22.320]   we want the best, and we commit to articulating
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.720]   what that would look like,
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:25.200]   then we can work systematically
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.700]   through the specific decisions.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:31.400]   - Peter in New York, thank you for your patience, sir.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.680]   You are up and you are the final one today.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.120]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.240]   - I'll try to make it quick.
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:42.640]   I think I got ripped off by someone offering
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:47.640]   a online service and should I try to sue this person
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.800]   to get my money back or is there anything else
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:53.760]   that I need to take stock of in a situation like this?
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.600]   - How much money?
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:57.720]   - 750 bucks.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.920]   - Can you do a charge back on a credit card?
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:04.400]   - I think it's been so long that I don't know.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.880]   I'm not sure what the time limit is on that
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.880]   'cause the payment was made about 18 months ago.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:11.700]   - So I don't know, but I would start
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:13.260]   with a charge back attempt.
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:15.000]   That would be the first thing.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.320]   And then are they communicating with you at all?
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.640]   - Periodically, yes.
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:23.800]   That's what's sort of frustrating is it was this service
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:25.800]   that I just don't think got off the ground.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.800]   I don't think it was a straight up scam,
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:31.000]   but it's one of these, hey, we're having cash flow problems,
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:31.820]   I'll get back to you.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:36.820]   So it's intermittent, but yeah, it's one of those,
[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:39.600]   the person hasn't totally ghosted,
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:43.400]   but quasi-responsive, I guess is how I would say it.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.600]   - I guess, I mean, in theory, so number one,
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.760]   try a charge back on your credit card.
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:50.520]   That would be number one.
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.920]   I've never actually looked into how long ago
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:53.900]   you can do that.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.600]   So I don't know what those laws are,
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:59.320]   and I'm ignorant to that.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.320]   I should go and study that a little bit.
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.080]   But I would start with a charge back on the credit card.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.560]   Obviously, I would talk to them,
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:07.900]   and I would ask them for a refund.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.640]   I would ask them for a partial refund
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:11.520]   if they won't give you a full refund.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.160]   And so if there's some kind of scenario
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:15.000]   where they delivered 20% of the value
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.760]   that they were expecting, listen, guys,
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.320]   could you refund $400 of it or something like that?
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.260]   That's reasonable.
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.860]   Being in the position of selling stuff online,
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:30.960]   the thing I want is I want happy customers.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:35.880]   And to me, having some guy's money
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:40.560]   that doesn't like me and doesn't like my stuff
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:43.800]   is not worth it if it means that the guy
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:45.640]   could go and write a nasty review
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.320]   or publish a website or something about me.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:49.960]   I don't go and look for that stuff.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.200]   I hope that there's nothing out there.
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.200]   I've never kept someone's money who wanted it back.
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.720]   I've never, 'cause I just don't want,
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:00.880]   I don't want it on my conscience, first of all.
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:02.320]   It's just a man, and I don't want it on the internet.
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:05.080]   I don't want people writing nasty stuff about me
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.000]   and saying, well, I didn't get this.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.680]   And so whenever anyone has ever asked me
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:11.120]   and expressed any form of dissatisfaction,
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.260]   I've immediately refunded their money
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:16.480]   or immediately made it right in some way.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:20.480]   And so now if this guy has sold something
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:24.740]   that he can't deliver on, and he has cashflow issues,
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:27.860]   he may wanna do that, but the money may be gone and spent.
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:30.860]   And yes, could you sue him and whatnot?
[02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:31.700]   Yeah, you could.
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:34.680]   I wouldn't waste my time with $750,
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:37.280]   because here's the way I look at it.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:41.300]   If it's $750 and $750 is a big deal for you
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:43.100]   because you're poor and broke, and I know you're not,
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:44.700]   but if you're poor and broke,
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:46.740]   then you don't have time to mess around
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:48.740]   with trying to get $750 from somebody.
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:50.060]   You need to go and make money.
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:53.460]   And if you're rich and successful, it's $750.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:55.820]   Screw it and move on, and just next time,
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:57.860]   think of a different solution.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:01.500]   I would never bother with trying to go with $750.
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:02.880]   I would never bother trying to go and do that.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:05.300]   Maybe you write a review, write a review,
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.980]   make a report with Better Business Bureau,
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:10.020]   something like that, put a review on his Google reviews
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:11.860]   or on his Facebook reviews, et cetera.
[02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:14.860]   Provide enough detail so that it's there
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:19.860]   to warn other people of the bad service,
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:23.320]   but that's as far as I would go.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:25.980]   - Okay, that sounds good.
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.140]   I'm gonna try to charge back.
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:27.980]   That's interesting.
[02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:28.800]   I'll see what the deal is with that.
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:31.380]   - Yeah, and then I think, I don't have much to add.
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:32.580]   I just wanna clarify.
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:35.140]   On the reviews, I think any normal,
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.660]   rational, experienced person understands
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:39.900]   that we can't make everyone happy.
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:44.180]   And so, when I see five-star reviews,
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:47.340]   one-star reviews, et cetera, we can't make everyone happy.
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.340]   And so, I will do business with people
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:53.380]   who have unhappy customers because people don't like us.
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:55.240]   We screw stuff up.
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.000]   But if in your review, there is an allegation of fraud,
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.980]   then that is really important.
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:02.460]   So I always pay careful attention
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:04.380]   to the way that reviews are written.
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:07.060]   So if you can provide an accurate assessment,
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:08.860]   and then if you can just make sure
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:11.220]   that you have whatever history or records
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:12.780]   that you have to protect yourself.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:15.280]   If somebody comes after you and sues you for libel,
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:16.860]   I don't think that, there's no way
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:17.960]   in the legal system to do that.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:20.540]   But just to know that you have support for it,
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.100]   if you write an accurate review,
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:23.400]   I think that's the way that you can do it.
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:26.000]   Write off the $750, take it as a business loss.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.220]   And I'm serious, it's totally a loss.
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.660]   And take it as a loss, and then do your service
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.720]   to the community by leaving an honest review
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:39.060]   in some format where it can be there as a warning
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:41.400]   to other potential buyers in the future.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:44.660]   - I will do that, sounds great.
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:45.860]   - Great, anything else?
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:47.740]   - Nope, have a great weekend.
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:48.700]   - Thank you so much.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:51.580]   And with that, we conclude our show for today,
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.260]   Mammoth Show today, but I haven't been able
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:54.620]   to do Q&A shows the last couple weeks,
[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:55.860]   so I'm glad to do it.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:57.580]   I wanna thank you for listening,
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:58.900]   thank you for being here.
[02:13:58.900 --> 02:14:00.820]   If you would like to ask me one of these questions,
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:04.020]   I tell you what, all my listeners got some free advice.
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.380]   (laughing)
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:08.040]   Some of these calls and whatnot were pretty long
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:08.880]   and pretty extensive.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:10.240]   Usually, I've had to charge people a lot of money,
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.200]   but I keep telling people,
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.520]   if you want a cheap way to talk to Joshua,
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.520]   just call in for a Friday Q&A show,
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.500]   'cause it gives me content, allows me to teach others,
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:19.080]   and everybody benefits from it.
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:19.920]   Thank you for listening.
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:22.520]   Remember that for four more days,
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.120]   you can enroll in my newest course,
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:26.160]   which is How to Retire Successfully.
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.680]   You can do that at howtoretiresuccessfully.com,
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.920]   howtoretiresuccessfully.com, four more days.
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.960]   At the moment, I haven't reached my number,
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:36.180]   so registration is still open.
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:39.340]   In addition to that, you heard me mention
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:41.040]   the International Escape Plan course.
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:43.400]   Internationalescapeplan.com is available to you,
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.760]   internationalescapeplan.com.
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:48.040]   With regard to Bitcoin, I had a caller that talked about,
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:50.160]   should I put money into Bitcoin
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:51.700]   as a way of moving to a foreign currency?
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.440]   You heard that my advice was no,
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.200]   but I do still think you should own Bitcoin.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.320]   And if you'd like to own Bitcoin privately,
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:02.960]   go to bitcoinprivacycourse.com, bitcoinprivacycourse.com.
