[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   [silence]
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.600]   There are now a lot of data supporting the idea
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.060]   that acupuncture of all things can be very beneficial
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.880]   for improving both female and male fertility
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.160]   and should a woman get pregnant
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.500]   for improving the quality of outcomes.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000]   That is the likelihood that there will be
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   a successful pregnancy that is carried to term,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.640]   not premature and so on and so forth.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.200]   Now, for some of you out there, you might think,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.400]   oh, of course, acupuncture.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.960]   Acupuncture has been known to work for thousands of years.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.400]   And therefore, it's not surprising
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.560]   that it would assist with fertility and pregnancy.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.400]   For many of you out there, however,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.680]   probably thinking acupuncture,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.680]   that seems kind of like fringe science.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.240]   But what I can assure you
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.080]   is that there are now quite a few clinical trials
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.520]   funded by government agencies
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.040]   like the National Institutes of Health
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.600]   showing that acupuncture is a very effective treatment
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.960]   for a number of different things,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.000]   including fertility and pregnancy,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   but for hormone status, for stress relief,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.200]   but even for chronic illnesses of different kinds,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.820]   including autoimmune illnesses.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.040]   So this is no longer considered fringe science.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.600]   In fact, one of the best laboratories in the world
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.320]   working on this is a laboratory
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.880]   out of Harvard Medical School
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.020]   run by a guy named Chufu Ma.
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.840]   Chufu's lab has really been exploring in a mechanistic way
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.040]   how the different stimulation sites
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.360]   that are used in acupuncture,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.100]   so where the needles are inserted,
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.800]   tap into neural pathways
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.040]   that link the different organs of the body.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   So for instance, they've found that stimulation
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   of a particular site on the lower limb
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.360]   can reduce inflammation dramatically throughout the body
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.920]   by way of neural pathways that originate in the lower limb
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.080]   and extend to areas such as the kidney and the pancreas.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.800]   So all these "ancient maps" of the human body
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.080]   as they relate to acupuncture
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.500]   are now being parsed at the level of mechanism,
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.560]   which I think is wonderful
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   because it not only is showing us
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.440]   that so much of what has been purported and reported
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.400]   in the landscape of acupuncture
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.000]   actually has an underlying mechanistic basis.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.200]   And with additional mechanistic understanding,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   of course, always arrive new and better practices.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.980]   That's the idea, to evolve these fields of acupuncture,
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.080]   to evolve the fields of mechanistic understanding
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.680]   of our biology and health.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.040]   And so the issue of whether or not acupuncture
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.920]   can assist in getting pregnant
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.620]   and in carrying a child to term
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.120]   and for that child to be healthy
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.520]   are really starting to emerge in a major way.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.860]   And rather than go into all those data in detail,
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.520]   what I can tell you is that there are clinical trials
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   and data supporting the fact that female fertility itself
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   can be supported by acupuncture through several mechanisms.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.260]   One of which is the balancing,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.760]   and I realize that's a somewhat tricky term
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.120]   and I'll define it better in a moment,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.200]   the balancing of hormones
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.360]   across the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.280]   including regulating levels of FSH
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.600]   so that they're not too high nor too low
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.720]   and restricting the FSH to the follicular phase
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.000]   of the menstrual cycle,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   as well as using acupuncture to improve things
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.720]   like blood flow and the health of the ovary itself
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.000]   and other aspects of the female reproductive axis.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   So acupuncture can operate at the chemical level,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.300]   impacting hormones.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.680]   It can act at the mechanical level,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500]   impacting the different tissues
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.280]   through which the egg has to pass and so on and so forth.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.160]   Likewise, on the male side,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.140]   acupuncture has been shown to improve semen volume,
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.760]   quality of sperm, sperm motility, et cetera,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.600]   and in large part through changes in the neural pathways
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.000]   that innervate the very tissues and vascular input
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.780]   to the scrotum and testicles,
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.000]   because as we learned earlier,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   temperature regulation of the scrotum and testicles
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.600]   is so vital for getting healthy sperm
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.640]   and increasing sperm quality.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.480]   In addition, there are good data to support the idea
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.920]   that acupuncture can increase levels of testosterone,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.760]   free testosterone and the sorts of hormones
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.680]   that are going to support healthy hormone production
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.480]   and sperm production in males.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.440]   And this is distinct from applying testosterone
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.900]   from an exogenous source, right?
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.320]   So when we're talking about acupuncture
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.880]   and increasing levels of testosterone,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.320]   we're talking about increasing levels
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.360]   of endogenous testosterone.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.840]   So those Leydig cells can support the Sertoli cells
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.440]   and the Sertoli cells can make that androgen binding protein
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.880]   and you get an enhanced spermatogenesis.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.200]   You can find evidence for all of these different features,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.600]   both changes to the chemical milieu, that is the hormones,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.520]   and changes to the mechanical milieu,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.800]   including for instance,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.120]   improvement of the pathways leading
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.280]   from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.320]   to the vas deferens,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.860]   basically clearing out the plumbing
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.520]   so that more quality ejaculate can be delivered,
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.920]   which of course is going to increase
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.000]   the probability of fertilization.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.560]   So when you hear that acupuncture
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.180]   can improve the likelihood of pregnancy,
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.400]   that's an accurate statement
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.460]   for which there are now increasing amounts
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.760]   of mechanistic data.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.080]   If you want to learn more about how acupuncture
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.760]   can be used to contribute
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.240]   to improve fertilization in pregnancy,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.880]   there are a number of different excellent reviews on this,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.640]   both as it relates to females and as it relates to males.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.200]   One of the best papers that I happen to like
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.360]   is one that we'll provide a link to in the references
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.120]   entitled Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.960]   for Female Fertility, an Overview of Systematic Review.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.600]   So a review of reviews.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.360]   This was published recently in 2021.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.720]   We'll provide a link to that.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.020]   And there's also going to be a link to a review
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.680]   that relates to acupuncture for male fertility
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.360]   and hormone augmentation.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.980]   I should just mention briefly
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.760]   that if you're going to look at scientific papers,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   one thing that you'll want to consider
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.920]   is also looking at the references that they reference.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.440]   Now, of course, papers tend to reference a ton of references
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.720]   in particular in reviews.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.080]   So what you'll want to do is look for the references
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.040]   that are showing up most often in the introduction.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.000]   Those references often are going to be
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.040]   the most prominent recent reviews
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.640]   or the most important findings in recent years.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.960]   That's not always the case, but that's often the case.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.700]   So if you read the first couple of paragraphs
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.580]   of these papers, and these are openly available
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.840]   as full text, by the way, online, if you go to these links,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.440]   you'll be able to access the best papers,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   the most relevant papers in the context
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.760]   of acupuncture supporting female
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.880]   and acupuncture supporting male fertility and hormone status.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.360]   you
