[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.300]   And in this episode, I want to talk about taking action in this bear market.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.680]   Because in the previous episode, I talked about how to buy treasury bonds.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.420]   So in Financial Samurai fashion, it's good to learn how, and then it's actually good
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.420]   to take action.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.880]   Otherwise, you're just learning for learning's sake, and nothing's ever going to change,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.760]   or nothing is ever going to happen.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.320]   So right now, we are back to bear markets.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.520]   S&P 500 is down about 25%.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.120]   And I remember-- this is interesting-- I remember back in 2009, it was much worse then.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   It was pretty scary.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.640]   We had like a 50% drawdown in the S&P 500.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.520]   And I started buying five-year CDs.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.000]   And why did I buy five-year CDs?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.120]   To lock up my money.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.160]   Well, it was because friends left and right were getting laid off.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.880]   I thought there was a good chance that I might get laid off.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.860]   So I was thinking to myself, hmm, I better start saving aggressively.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.520]   And CDs at the time, five-year CDs, were yielding over 4%.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.820]   So is this deja vu?
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.440]   Because US treasuries are yielding over 4%, or at least they were.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.680]   But you can still see some durations, like five-year treasury notes yielding over 4%.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.440]   And so I have been buying three-year, two-year, one-year, nine-month treasuries, because they're
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.440]   all yielding over 4%, 4.18% to 4.45%.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   And what I remember about the global financial crisis is that when my CDs came due in 2012
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.720]   and 2013, I staggered them.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   But they were five years.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.200]   I think I might have bought a seven-year once.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040]   But I was like, wow, I should have just bought stocks, because the stock market had roared
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.920]   back after five to seven years.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.040]   So I say there's a good chance the stock market will roar back in five to seven years.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.640]   And it's almost like deja vu.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.320]   Do I want to make that same mistake and invest so heavily into risk-free assets?
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.520]   This is something that you and I have to think about on our own.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.080]   And my answer is I am going to invest about 60% of my cash hoard into US treasuries.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.040]   And this time, I'm going to stagger them, not all five-year and seven-year.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.960]   I'm going to stagger them to three-month, nine-month, one-year, two-year, and three-year.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.880]   Three-month treasury bills are only yielding about 3.5%.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.000]   So you're not getting the 4.45% as you could with a three-year.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.520]   But you get that money back in three months.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.220]   And it's nice to always feel liquid during times of uncertainty.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.000]   It always feels off, folks, to deploy your capital during a bear market.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.040]   It's a natural instinct to hold onto certainty, to hold onto what you have.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.320]   But US treasuries, as you listened in my previous episode, are risk-free investments, especially
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.700]   if you invest on the short end of the curve.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.720]   So I would utilize, at least take advantage of these higher rates for the cash that you
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.700]   plan to sit in your bank account and protect you from emergencies anyway.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.120]   Because after three months or nine months or six months, you're going to be liquid on
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.620]   a rolling basis.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.800]   So start now.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.760]   And in three months or later, depending on the duration, you're going to be liquid.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.520]   And you're going to have that rolling liquidity every single month.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.600]   Well, with 60% allocated towards US treasuries at various durations, what about the remaining
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.920]   40%?
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.040]   10% is going to go into the S&P 500 at 3,600 or below.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.560]   The valuations are reasonable.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.240]   But the fear, the risk, is that earnings will be cut by the end of this year, let's say
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.880]   by 10%.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.020]   And the S&P 500 could therefore go down another 10%.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.020]   Nobody knows.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.920]   But it would seem logical with all this slowdown and all this uncertainty that earnings would
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   be cut and the stock market could go down.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.160]   However, the PE valuation of the S&P 500 could go up as the markets anticipate the future
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000]   six to 12 months from now, better times ahead.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.280]   So nobody really knows, which is why I'm willing to leg in at current levels.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   And I look at 3,200 on the S&P 500 as a realistic worst case scenario, or 10% downside from
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   here.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.200]   The other 10%, I'm still legging into Heartland Real Estate.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.240]   Heartland Real Estate has done phenomenally well in 2022.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.080]   It's outperformed the S&P 500 by over 30%.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.240]   But Heartland Real Estate is going to slow as well.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.800]   Supplies coming on board, rents are fading.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.720]   And rents, it's really interesting because as mortgage rates rose, it pushed out the
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.000]   marginal buyers, or just buyers in general.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.200]   And so they decided to rent.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   So rents went up in the Heartland, in the Sun Belt.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.000]   But that is unsustainable in terms of the percentage gains.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.680]   Rents should grow by the rate of inflation.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.280]   Well, inflation is high at about 8%.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.520]   But in the Sun Belt, rents have been growing in the double digits, in the 15%, 16%, 17%.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.360]   I expect that to moderate.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.800]   But I'm still legging in a little bit on the way up.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.160]   And it's probably going to fade.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.080]   But I'm focused on the long term in terms of investing in single family and multifamily
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.720]   real estate in the Sun Belt of America.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.240]   So Fundrise is my favorite platform.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.640]   That's been their thesis for a decade now.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.400]   And that's been my thesis since 2016.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.200]   You can check out fundrise@financialsamurai.com/fundrise.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.520]   So so far, we have 60% to treasuries, 10% to the S&P 500, 10% to private real estate
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   funds.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.400]   We're at 80%.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.120]   What's up with the last 20%?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.520]   Well, I like venture capital and venture debt.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.400]   I like investing in both asset classes.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   I've lived here in San Francisco for over 20 years.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.920]   And it's all about building great companies.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.600]   A lot of tech companies, just a lot of startups.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.680]   And if you can invest early in some of these companies, you could do very, very well.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.160]   A lot of these companies are staying private for longer.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.000]   So the returns are being accrued to private investors more than public investors.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.600]   And it's good for diversification.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.640]   I don't have to see that daily price movements of these companies.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.720]   Oftentimes, I just invest, meet the capital calls, and then just sit back and let the
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.480]   managers do their thing.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.800]   And it does feel really good to farm out capital, to let professionals who are thinking about
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.440]   their investment style all day long try to invest in good investments for you.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.560]   Yeah, you pay a fee.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.920]   It's not cheap, folks.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.480]   2% of management, 20% of profits upside.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.360]   It's a lot of money versus just buying the S&P 500.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   But again, I have about 10% of my net worth into these type of investments, venture debt
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.600]   and venture capital.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:13.680]   So venture capital is investing more in equities, seed stage, series A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   so forth.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.760]   And venture capital is basically investing in these private companies, but lending them
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.440]   money and getting a return.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.960]   And sometimes you get warrants, which are options to buy equity as well.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.080]   Venture debt is relatively less risky because the company is already capitalized, and you're
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.440]   just going in there and lending them money, lending well-capitalized companies money to
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.880]   get paid back at a higher interest rate.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.620]   And in a high interest rate environment, venture debt actually as a whole should do better
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.120]   than venture capital.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.560]   But again, no guarantees.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.600]   I just like both styles of private investments.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.840]   And I know the GPs, and I believe in the GPs and their work ethic and their vision.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   All right.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   So what else should you do with your cash?
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.360]   In terms of paying down debt, I would absolutely pay down consumer debt, revolving consumer
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.520]   debt, i.e. credit card debt, because your credit card interest rate is going to go higher
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   with the Fed hiking rates by 3% to 4%, right?
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.400]   So the average credit card interest rate is about 18% to 19%.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.640]   Don't pay that, folks.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.840]   That is just highway robbery.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.320]   So if you've got credit card debt, please use your cash to pay that down.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.760]   You know, embolden, bolster your cash flow, and stop making the credit card companies
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   rich.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.400]   In terms of mortgage debt, I would say don't pay off your mortgage debt.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.240]   Earlier in the year, I paid off some negative interest rate, negative real interest rate
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.560]   mortgage debt.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.540]   And that was a suboptimal move, because you want to always be optimizing your cash.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.000]   If you have a negative real interest rate mortgage, that means inflation is higher than
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   your mortgage interest rate.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.320]   So inflation is paying down your mortgage debt for you.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.360]   However, I just did it anyway, because it always feels good to pay down debt.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.320]   And I've always paid down debt and invested at the same time using my FS-DARE framework,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.000]   so FS, Debt and Investment Ratio framework.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.680]   And if I follow this framework over time, if you do as well, you're always going to
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.100]   be winning somehow.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.800]   So the beginning of the year, I was paying down some mortgage debt.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.400]   It wasn't the right optimal financial move, but I felt good.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.200]   And I understood how I felt, and I understood why it wasn't the optimal move.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.720]   However, fast forward to today, it turns out, hey, paying down mortgage debt is a 25 plus
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.080]   percent outperforming move, because that money didn't go into the stock market.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   Right?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.440]   Obviously, at the time, I didn't know that.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.740]   But again, you're always winning if you're always paying down debt.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.920]   And today, well, we still have high inflation, but you can live for free now by buying US
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.960]   Treasury bills or bonds, which yield a higher rate than your mortgage.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:05.000]   So in this scenario, paying down mortgage debt is even more of a suboptimal move.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.680]   So I'm not going to be paying down any more mortgage debt from now on.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.320]   I'm just going to see how things go, pay my regular mortgage payments every single month.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.040]   And if inflation starts rolling over and if Treasury yields start rolling over to or below
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.200]   my mortgage rate, then I'll start getting motivated.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.760]   But my primary residence mortgage is at 2.175% for the next, what, five years.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:37.080]   So I just don't see the 10-year Treasury bond getting to that level anytime soon.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.840]   But it is interesting, folks, right?
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.440]   So inflation is ramped higher relatively quickly within 12 months, and it could collapse relatively
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.280]   quickly within 12 months.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.620]   You just never know.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.480]   So that's why investing in shorter duration T-bills is good for liquidity.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.280]   But that's also why investing in long-dated Treasury bonds, let's say 20 years, might
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.200]   actually be quite smart as well.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.000]   Because if inflation rolls over and collapses back to the long-term trend of 2%, locking
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.600]   in a 4.45% 20-year Treasury bond is probably pretty good.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.660]   You're not going to get rich, but on a relative basis, it's going to look pretty good.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:24.100]   All right, here is the final way I would be spending my cash hoard.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.100]   Continuing education.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:32.500]   I bet, I bet the large majority of folks do not spend any money on continuing education,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.540]   right?
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.180]   Everything is for free online, so why bother?
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:42.780]   But spending more intentionally on your education could very well be the best investment you
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.100]   can ever make, and continuously spending money on your education.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.580]   Right now, for example, you can just spend $20, $20 to buy Buy This, Not That, How to
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.840]   Spend Your Way to Wealth and Freedom on Amazon, on wherever you want to buy books.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.060]   Super cheap, but you're going to gain a wealth of knowledge worth, I would say, 100, 1,000
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.020]   times more than the cost of the book.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.260]   And I think it's very similar to other books.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.700]   One of the peculiar things about now being a published author is that I get to read other
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.200]   authors' books, and I'm addicted.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.120]   I am buying books, I'm receiving books, and I'm reading every single day all these topics
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.340]   in terms of finance, self-help, meditation, the youth sports industry, and so forth.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:35.380]   And it's just fascinating, and I love enriching my brain through deep, deep dive reading.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.300]   Reading a book is just a deeper and different way of learning.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.940]   Listening to podcasts like this one, it's nice.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940]   It scratches the surface.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.780]   Hopefully, I go a little bit deeper and I help you take more action.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.020]   But compared to a book where you're just immersed in it, you're looking at the charts, you're
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.180]   really thinking about what the author is saying, it's an even more enriching experience, and
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.460]   it's low cost.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.560]   And if you don't want to buy books, you can obviously go on YouTube and watch hundreds
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.860]   of hours about anything you want.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.740]   As a landlord, I've gone on YouTube many times to learn how to fix things, right?
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.180]   Fix change faucets, fix showers, fix garage doors, and so forth.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.860]   And I feel I have all these skills to be a pretty good handyman now in the real estate
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   market.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.820]   Your children or you could learn about any single topic from middle school and high school.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.880]   It's a really great supplemental learning for free tool.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.260]   You can also go back to school part time.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.660]   That's what I did in 2003.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.420]   This is after the dot-com bubble.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.280]   I was worried about whether I would be able to keep my job because people were getting
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.740]   let go after the dot-com bust, and there was like 10 years of the equity market going nowhere.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.660]   I didn't know that at the time, but it didn't feel that great in 2002 and 2003.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.380]   So I decided to go to UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business part time to get my MBA.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.940]   And that lasted for three years, and it cost a lot of money, but I got 80 plus percent
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.940]   of my tuition reimbursed by my firm.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:15.340]   And I also got my MBA and learned a lot of things about marketing, real estate, finances,
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.880]   entrepreneurship, that gave me a ton of confidence.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.300]   By the time I was 30 years old, with my MBA, with eight years of experience in finance
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.760]   and banking, I was feeling like a confident man.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.980]   And as a result, my career progressed accordingly.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.420]   I got paid more, I got promoted, and it felt great.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.340]   Don't underestimate the power of confidence.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:44.420]   The confidence you gain by increasing your knowledge is very powerful, very rewarding.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.220]   When you have confidence, because you have knowledge, good things tend to happen.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.780]   You start making more optimal decisions.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.500]   You start looking at problems as a fun challenge.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.940]   You look at things differently.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.940]   You really do.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.900]   And you have better control over your emotions.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.740]   You don't let things easily bother you, because you can look at different perspectives better.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:12.300]   All right, I'd love to hear how you are spending your cash hoard in this bear market.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:20.120]   Remember, bear markets on average last about 12 months, and they on average see a 35% drawdown.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.820]   We're about nine months in, and we've seen a 25% drawdown.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:30.260]   So the bad times could continue for a while, but what's better than educating yourself,
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:35.220]   enriching your mind during the bad time to prepare for the better times ahead?

[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.620]   And also, I'm thinking about 2023 and whether you find value in this podcast.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.260]   I do this as a labor of love.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.580]   I love connecting and speaking.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.380]   However, I'm trying to optimize my time.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.260]   So if you would like to support this podcast, please leave a review.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.380]   And if there are no reviews, it's okay, because it gives me permission to do other things
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.100]   in 2023.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.540]   And I just wanted to commit to recording at least 50 episodes in 2022, because that was
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.180]   my promise at the beginning of the year, and I never, never break my promise.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.340]   Thanks so much, everyone, and hang in there.
