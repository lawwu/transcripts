[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.380]   I'm sure everyone knows who he is we obviously talked about Jared's interview with Lex Friedman
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.320]   on the pod a couple of weeks ago and what happened to Matthew DM Jared and started chatting and said
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.600]   hey would you be interested in coming to talk with us yeah about these matters very you know

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.140]   you for having me so I don't think you need much of an introduction obviously you were a senior
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.300]   advisor to President Trump from 2017 to 2021 and you worked on the U.S Mexico relationship as well
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.980]   as led the Middle East peace efforts which I think is going to make up the bulk of what we're excited
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:09.060]   to talk about today just really briefly since leaving um office you've been investing running
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.360]   a firm called affinity partners is that right maybe you can share with us just a little bit
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.020]   about what you've been up to and then we'll you know kind of get into it here perfect
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.520]   affinity Partners is a private equity firm that I started when we left doing growth investing
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   private equity investing globally we raised just over 3.1 billion doing a lot of investments trying
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.980]   to bring Gulf money into Israel into the U.S trying to figure out how through investments
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480]   you could bring countries closer together people closer together looking at a lot of areas where
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.060]   there's structural transitions happening at large in the global economy whether it's near shoring
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.960]   from offline to online you know software a lot of different interesting areas
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.360]   a lot of the the Fintech space and Financial Services right now but you know enjoying it and
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.820]   the goal is really to bring the experience that we had from the previously being an investor and
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.280]   then the time in government and then thinking through how you could use those macro learnings
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.340]   and connections and relationships and navigational skills to the investing side right so we're going
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.680]   to try and talk later in the show uh about macro markets a bit talk a little bit about some of the
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.940]   activity in AI this week we think it's all pretty fresh in the
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.640]   world hopefully we can call dialogue about that I think it'd be helpful when you and I talk just to
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.920]   get ready for the show today you mentioned that you had a very liberal upbringing in the Upper East
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.360]   Side in New York and your perspective began to shift as you started to travel the country then
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.840]   you were in the Trump White House and have become very active since would love to hear a little bit
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.140]   about how your perspective shifted in the time you spent because you mentioned you started traveling
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.100]   the country and seeing things that you otherwise hadn't seen living in the Upper East Side would
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.880]   love to hear that part of your story and then we'll see you in the next episode.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.340]   story before we kind of get into things if you wouldn't mind sharing yeah sure so one thing about
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.700]   my life is that nothing has gone according to the plan I grew up in New Jersey a really nice place
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.500]   in Livingston my father was an entrepreneur in the real estate business banking insurance did a lot
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.260]   of different things really brought up me and my siblings to be focused on business and it really
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.680]   for us was a good experience growing up I actually went to Harvard and then after that chose to go to
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.560]   law school and business school where I was at NYU during that time my my father had a legal issue
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.360]   and I was forced to take over the business and so I got into the real estate business and then after
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.640]   that bought a media company in New York and that's really where I got exposure to a lot of what are
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.820]   called New York society my wife and I we met got married and through that experience I thought we
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.260]   had a very expanded world view at our house in the Upper East Side we have dinner parties we
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.620]   have heads of banks and hedge funds and technology companies and fashion
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.500]   and and um and then it was just you know really nice life and then her father announced he was
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.060]   running for office and that was a an interesting experience for us as Republican we didn't know too
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.080]   many Republicans um were you registered Democrat prior uh I was registered Democrat going up uh my
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.160]   father was a big Democrat donor we were we'd have in our house whether it be you know Chuck Schumer
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.600]   Hillary Clinton I think my father gave uh Cory Booker his first campaign donation so I know
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.500]   Cory since I'm 15 years old uh so really grew up around Democrat politics
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.260]   uh all of our life but over time I I think during the Obama years I I changed my registration to an
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.600]   independent I didn't feel uh like the Democrat party was fully representing my my viewpoints I
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.880]   felt more independent-minded and then um during the time with my father-in-law when he was running
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.980]   for office he invited me to go with him to a rally in Springfield Illinois we flew out there I got
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.900]   off the plane and um you know we we pull up to an arena and the guy comes up to Trump and says
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.380]   uh congratulations sir you just broke the record for the arena for
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.060]   independence uh then he says well who had the who had the record before and he says well it's Elton
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.920]   John 36 years earlier and he says Jared look I don't even have a guitar or piano this is impressive
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.020]   you know so you know he gets up on stage and and without really notes you know riffs for over an
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.640]   hour and it was interesting for me because I was watching you know CNN and the New York Times and
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.920]   all my friends the media basically were describing his rallies as almost like KKK conventions but I
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.540]   walked around the crowd nobody knew who I was then and what I saw was that these were just you know
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.320]   they were people were
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.760]   old young male female white minority and um and uh and it was just people who were hard-working
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.380]   Americans who who you know really felt like Trump was giving them a voice and what was interesting
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.300]   to me was a couple weeks earlier we'd been at the Robin Hood Foundation which is the big uh
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.920]   philanthropy in New York where a lot of the hedge fund managers uh support I remember the chairman
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.600]   of Robin Hood getting up and saying you know if we want to save you know the next generation we
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.960]   want to save the kids in the inner cities uh we have to uh we have to
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.400]   we have to support Common Core that's the way that we can save people and I remember Trump gets up
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.260]   there and he says uh you know if we want to save education we have to end Common Core and send it
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.340]   to the states I'm saying wait I thought I thought Common Core was this great thing and but why are
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.560]   all these people against it and so it really just kind of piqued my interest and made me realize
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.860]   that maybe my aperture was was way smaller um way more closed than I thought it was and it
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.840]   really led me to to seek out a lot of people who had differing points of view than the people I'd
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.180]   been around before I really opened my aperture explored a lot and over the years I really got
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.260]   the chance to meet with people from both sides so you know I have a lot of friends who are independent
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.420]   friends who are liberal friends who are very Republican and uh you know my personal view
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.700]   was I thought of myself more as a pragmatist fact-based and data-driven and based on that
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.620]   I tried to pursue uh the different policies that I thought made the most sense uh in as
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.780]   unemotional a way as possible how did you figure out that that moment in Springfield
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.040]   could translate all throughout the country like was there a process that you guys went through to
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.560]   validate like hold on is this just a moment in time or is this just a specific area or what is
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:00.400]   how did you guys get to the ground truth of what the scalable marketable candidate looked like
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.140]   because I'm sure that was part of the calculus in what you did because it I think the to your point
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.800]   maybe the media's perspective was hold on a second this this guy is riffing but it clearly went very
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.720]   quickly from riffing to a methodical plan
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.160]   and I don't think that that's ever really been talked about do you want to just tell us a little
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.560]   bit about that sure well I would say it was less planned and way more entrepreneurial and I say
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.780]   entrepreneurial in in two different senses you know one is the campaign was one was run incredibly
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.700]   entrepreneurially people were told that if you work for Trump you'll never get a job in Washington
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.140]   again which is why he really wasn't able to hire a lot of people initially and why a lot of the
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.460]   responsibility for the campaign fell to people like myself who really just cared about him
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.660]   personally and wanted to make
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.760]   sure that he was able to do a competent job with the operations of a campaign that led to us doing
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.600]   a lot of things in an untraditional way but we actually were able to make the dollars go a lot
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.880]   further whether it was building a data operation or how we targeted advertisers or how we you know
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.140]   did our events we were able to just do it in a much different way but from a viability of the
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.760]   candidate perspective I really give all the credit to him because what I saw with politicians is a
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.620]   lot of politicians will take polls and then moderate their perspectives this is somebody
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.540]   who without pollsters and without any political
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.840]   experience um really put forward a lot of points of view and keep in mind in a Republican primary a
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.740]   lot of his viewpoints on trade were very uh heterodoxical they were they were not what
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.660]   was conventionally thought of and what I saw with Trump was that he was able to move the polls to
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.240]   him and that was uh that was a talent and just a skill of persuasion uh and his willingness to kind
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.620]   of stick to the issues I mean at that point in time I remember seeing polls that illegal immigration
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.940]   was not like a top five issue when he started the campaign by you know the middle to end of the
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.440]   campaign people were really seeing uh the craziness that was happening at the southern border and why
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.720]   that was uh critical to our National Security and so um I think that for him he found a lot of his
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.940]   message and with him he was not a perfectly uh always on message candidate but what he did do
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.500]   was he was constantly evolving and learning and you know and would learn from the different things
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:09.400]   that happened and constantly evolving to uh find ways to to persist amazing like a startup finding
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.880]   a product Market fit yeah and what's he like as a father-in-law I'm curious
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.320]   uh as a father-in-law he's been great you know that obviously brought us a lot closer together
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.640]   you know until that time our time was mostly they're playing golf together or we'd be together
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.760]   at family events uh working together was uh was was a different element of our relationship but
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.120]   I think one of the benefits I had with him was that he knew I was always going to tell him the
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:37.060]   truth uh whether I agreed with him or not I also I think one of the things he liked about me was
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.460]   that I I was not obviously worked hard I gave him straight answers and I didn't opine on things where
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.780]   I didn't feel like I had an expertise so if you would ask me a question and I didn't feel like I
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.140]   knew the answer I would say well this is not my expertise these are the people who I would
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.120]   recommend I speak to to get perspective and let me bring you their their opinions and so I think
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.980]   he saw me as somebody who was who was competent obviously had his best interests at heart again
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.820]   I wasn't accepting money for any of these jobs so it wasn't doing it for for financial gain
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.560]   um and I just started to really believe in a lot of the policies that he was pushing and wanted
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.160]   to help him maybe translate it from a campaign speech to kind of technical
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.260]   policy and then see once he got the opportunity to help him implement it as well that's really
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.420]   cool why did you agree to do Lex and why are you doing the show today we were kind of surprised to
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:29.020]   see you on Lex and obviously like Lex said it was a very different conversation than I think any of
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.300]   us would have expected having the only exposure to you being through you know some sort of media
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:40.960]   channels what's motivating you to kind of do this today before we get into it so Lex um again him my
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.100]   wife are friends and I I'm not sure if you've heard of him but he's a great guy he's a great guy
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:49.060]   I I really follow and listen to what he does I I think in Society Today the the news uh it's kind
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.680]   of just one person's you know point of view and and they're they're they're picking and choosing
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.120]   and editing what they put into it one way or the other but the medium of the podcast is something
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.520]   that I my personal consumption uh was growing with and I felt like it was a place where you
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.080]   could have real conversations I think the people who are listening to podcasts are people who are
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.040]   looking to have a more nuanced uh perspective on something and really want to
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.320]   you know try to understand something deeper and and I respect Lex I all my private conversations
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:25.540]   with him I I really enjoyed um and I love that he was really trying to um find perspectives from
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:31.720]   people that maybe others didn't understand to try to bring greater understanding across
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.060]   and so I agreed to do it after a while I was really really glad I did and uh based on the
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.980]   the great feedback I got uh there uh my sense is is that the podcast format is is something
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.300]   that's um you could have a real conversation you can go back and forth you could argue you
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.160]   could disagree um I think that that's where people really want to get their information from so I I
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.480]   turned down a lot of you know cable news or different uh interview requests um because I
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.040]   find that you can't have as nuanced a discussion and you know I wish things were as simple as you
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.240]   know the black and white or the political slogans that people use but the reality is things are a
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.020]   lot more nuanced so when shemoth reached out I followed you guys and I've listened to you for
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.440]   for some time I was uh I was really happy to come do it awesome
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.480]   well thanks for doing it uh sex you want to kick us off on the Gaza conflict and
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.860]   framing up the present day sure based on what I've read it seems like Israel has now formed
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:31.240]   a perimeter around uh Gaza City they've sort of bisected Gaza between this north and uh South
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.340]   and they've been trying to bomb entry or exit points from the Hamas tunnel network
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.860]   and it seems like their strategy is to kind of gradually close in on that
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:48.040]   tunnel network and basically try and eliminate Hamas from from sort of this northern part of
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.120]   Gaza and then one assumes they'll move to the south and I guess one other element to add to
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:14:00.700]   it is that you know while Israel is doing that you're seeing protests both in the West and in the
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.700]   Arab or Muslim world you're starting to see statements condemning Israel by
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.800]   leaders of these other countries in the region I'd say the one by Turkey by
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:18.040]   Taiwan was notably harsh and threatening but you're starting to see again as Israel proceeds
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.960]   with this operation you're starting to see more and more condemnation from various parts of the
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.160]   international community so let's start with that is you know how do you assess what's happening on
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.260]   the ground what do you think the prospects for success are and how do you assess the risk that
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:38.800]   this sort of escalates horizontally in ways that are kind of hard to predict and could spiral out
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.740]   of control yeah so so there's a lot of different
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.100]   ways you can go with that but I'll start with kind of the first question which is
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.180]   um in the immediate aftermath of the attack my biggest concern was that Israel was clearly
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.800]   caught off guard from an intelligence and military perspective with the attack and the attacks were
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.900]   they shook a lot of people they were they were very very heinous beyond
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.420]   um really comprehension it's it's crazy the more and more stuff that comes out and we were seeing
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.440]   a lot of in a real time thanks to you know the fact that right now with X and what what Elon's
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:11.680]   done there's a lot of things that we're seeing in real time thanks to you know the fact that right now with X and what what Elon's done there's a lot of things that we're seeing in real time thanks to you know the fact that right now with X and what what Elon's done there's a lot of things that we're seeing in real time thanks to you know the fact that right now with X and what what Elon's done
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.620]   there's a lot of things that we're seeing in real time thanks to you know the fact that right now with X and what what Elon's done there to to not try to censor things in the way
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.640]   that was happening before so we were all getting a lot of information real time and it was really
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.500]   pulling at a lot of people's heartstrings my big fear initially was that Israel would react
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:29.380]   uh emotionally as opposed to uh to pragmatically and I think that the steps that they've taken since
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:34.360]   then have been uh very wise I think the fact that they took their time and have been very methodical
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.420]   about getting their supply lines ready about working how to Garner's much international support
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.620]   I mean you have to remember these
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.220]   weren't just Israeli citizens that were killed these were American citizens they were German
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.260]   citizens they were Thai citizens they were UK citizens and and the hostages as well are not
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:56.020]   just Israeli citizens so I think that Israel took its time to get the military operations set I've
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.820]   seen them go slowly methodically I mean Gaza is a very very complicated place I mean we studied
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.620]   it for four years we we we were very closely watching all the different incursions we managed
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:11.560]   Hamas and and their uh their malicious activities uh very very closely uh to avoid situations
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.020]   like this and uh the place is booby trapped like like crazy and so I do think the fact that the
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.740]   Israelis have taken their time and been very methodical and I've come up with a strategy
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.720]   has given me more hope every morning I wake up and I look to see you know praying there hasn't
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.640]   been more casualties um in Israel and um and the hope is that they continue to do it in the
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.580]   best way possible um so I think that the goal for them is really the elimination of Hamas I
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.960]   think that um you know the the big point that I really want to make in the Lex podcast which is why
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.500]   I went back uh to really do the point was that um the people who are protesting um in favor of
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.660]   the Palestinians a lot of the Israelis and Palestinians want the same thing which is uh
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.560]   they want security for Israel and a better life for the Palestinians and I think what people have
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.320]   failed to really grasp for a long time is that Hamas has been the root cause of a lot of the the
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.780]   the bad lives for the Palestinians if you think about Gaza uh before this recent before October
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.600]   7th I mean over half the population lived under the poverty line
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.060]   um you know people were really trapped there and people would blame Israel for the blockade but
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.260]   what's also happened over the last 30 days is a lot of the worst fears that we had during the
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.100]   administration or things that Israel would be saying I have totally been proven true I mean
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.240]   you've seen now I'm going to some of these uh school houses where there's you know there's 500
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.460]   or 50 different you know rocket launchers um you know in the school houses the hospitals all the
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.580]   terrorists that they've captured that they're interrogating are saying well that's where the
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.240]   military headquarters are you know now we're learning about this um
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.860]   this tunnel Network which they're saying is hundreds of miles of tunnels underground well
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.240]   that's why you know Israel wasn't allowing cement and a lot of these these materials in the cement
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.400]   that went in which was supposed to build houses for for the people of Gaza was then stolen by Hamas
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.040]   to to build these tunnels the uh the pipes that went in to to fix the water were then taken and
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   turned into to rockets that the fuel was was was stolen and and not used for for for the hospitals
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.180]   or for people to have better lives it was stolen for them to operate their tunnel network and then
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.980]   then to fuel the rockets so um it's a situation that that really does have to be dealt with again
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.380]   Israel you guys are I know poker players so uh so Israel definitely has the stronger you know hand
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:25.300]   to play here so I think time is on the one hand in their in their favor uh but on the other hand
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.640]   obviously you know the international community has historically been very uh anti-israel and
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.500]   anti-semitic in the way that they've approached a lot of these uh these skirmishes uh to date but
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.760]   I will say I think there's been more international support for Israel this time than I've ever seen
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:45.100]   um and I do think that that's a very important thing so that that's maybe General if there were
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.340]   some of the specific questions that you wanted to get to in there I can what about the risk of
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.020]   horizontal escalation let's just talk about that for a second because you do hear I think a growing
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:19:00.040]   chorus of countries who are denouncing Israel they're saying that this is collective punishment
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:07.060]   that the bombing of Gaza is indiscriminate they want it to stop there's genocide genocide yeah
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.700]   I'm not saying I agree with that rhetoric but you you do hear it
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:15.940]   you know there's a effort at the UN to um to pass a ceasefire resolution so there's a lot of people
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:21.040]   who want the ceasefire and there's a lot of growing international pressure for that and
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.720]   then you've heard threats from you know again Erdogan in Turkey that if there's not a ceasefire
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.420]   at some point they're gonna have to get involved they're gonna have to act Iran has said similar
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.360]   kinds of things although I think it's pretty clear they don't want to get involved they don't want
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   this to escalate in a into a wider regional war but they've sort of intimated that if
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.720]   the bombing continues that they might have to take action they might feel pressure to do that
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.640]   so I guess one question there is is time on Israel's side it does seem like
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.380]   again there's more pressure to stop the military operation over time
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:20:00.340]   as opposed to less yeah so so the answer is everyone's talking their book and that's what
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.240]   they should be doing they're talking to their populations the question is what people will
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.800]   actually do I would say that you know the hardest thing for us all is obviously you see civilians in
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.660]   Gaza who are being used as human shields and the last thing that anyone wants is for more civilian
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.280]   deaths to occur it's funny this morning I was speaking to a friend in Israel who was telling
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:25.420]   me that yesterday there was a a major evacuation of of civilians in Gaza and a lot of people were
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.280]   surprised that the Israeli defense forces were basically putting themselves in between the Hamas
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.320]   militants and the Gazan civilians to protect them and open up a corridor and again one thing that
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.740]   Israel has done I think a good job of is getting out a lot of the facts about
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:44.380]   how they've been warning the Gazan civilians to flee asked them to go and and what happened was
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.400]   Hamas was you know shooting them down with snipers and trying to prevent them from going because they
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.080]   wanted them to stay in place as human shields in in the schools and the hospitals where they
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.420]   were conducting their terror activities and so what was interesting to me was um well my friend
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.520]   was telling me is speaking to a friend of his who was a soldier was that uh was that um is that a
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.080]   lot of the civilians are really thanking them for liberating them from from Hamas and for risking
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.680]   their lives to help them out and you know I think that's that's a really important thing to think
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.060]   them get out of Gaza. A lot of these people, again, they've been prisoners to Hamas more than
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.920]   anything else for a long time. They want to see themselves out of there so that they can perhaps
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.780]   have a better opportunity to live a better life. I think that the current region, I think the
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:31.440]   biggest immediate threat is from Hezbollah to the north. I think Israel going to full ready alert
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.680]   was a really smart thing. I think the US moving the battle carriers there, I think was also good.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:42.700]   I think the statements from the US administration were strong up front. Again, whether people
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.360]   believe that they'll back up those statements is another thing because they do have a little bit
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.620]   of a credibility deficit in the region based on what they've done over the last couple of years.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:22:00.800]   I think that's all been very helpful in pushing Iran back and sending a strong message to Hezbollah,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.240]   which is if you want to attack Israel, don't do it when they're at full military readiness.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.500]   Israel's a nuclear power.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.280]   Aaron Ross Powell, Ph.D.:
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:06.600]   I think every-
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:06.760]   Aaron Ross Powell, Ph.D.:
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.620]   everyone is starting to realize that this has been Iran trying to manipulate things. As long as
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.400]   they think there's a threat that you're not going to go after one of their proxies, but you may go
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.680]   after them, that's been the best way of keeping de-escalation. I think with Turkey and others,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.440]   I've spent many hours with Erdogan personally talking about Gaza. I know that he has a big
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.640]   heart for the Palestinian people. He hates to see their suffering. It's also good politics from him.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.740]   He's also from a Muslim Brotherhood leading party. I think in a
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.000]   very religious heart, he does have to acknowledge that a lot of their plight is led to by bad
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.920]   governance. He may not want to admit it publicly, but the reality is the best way to improve the
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.860]   lives of the people of Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and put in place a structure where people can
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:57.200]   finally have the opportunity to live more freely and make better lives for themselves.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.500]   Aaron Ross Powell, Ph.D.:
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.620]   Jared, you said something that I think is really interesting. You said Erdogan has
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.540]   a soft spot for the Palestinians. Can I just take that concept and just can you explain the
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.560]   historical context of the situation? Can you explain the historical context of the situation?
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   Jared Ranere:
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.160]   Sure. I think it's really interesting to see the context of Arabs, the Arab world and their
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:15.380]   relationship with the Palestinians, because it's definitely had its ebbs and flows over the arc of
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.840]   history. How do people think about it, just broadly speaking, just in terms of the big
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:26.960]   historical arcs that have shaped this relationship between Arabs and Palestinians specifically?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.380]   Aaron Ross Powell, Ph.D.:
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.680]   Well, that's a question we could spend about three days talking about,
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.380]   but I'll try to give you a very quick version of it. I think that a lot of this goes back really,
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:43.220]   to people say it goes back to a lot of times, but I think that we have to probably go back to,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.080]   and I'll try to do this very quick, is really in 1948, which was a complicated time. It's post
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.280]   Holocaust, post World War II. Again, the Middle East really in the early 1900s was created by a
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.800]   lot of arbitrary lines drawn by foreigners. And you had a situation where Israel is,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.200]   the UN puts forth the partition plan, Israel, they're willing to recognize Israel as a state for
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.660]   Jewish people and also give a state to the Palestinians. The Arabs reject that and attack
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:17.000]   Israel and there's a whole war. During that war, it was flared up really by General Nasser from
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.860]   Egypt, who at the time was the leader of the Muslim world. During that war, Israel was able
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.720]   to defy the odds and win. And a lot of Palestinians were either forced from their homes or displaced
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.200]   from their homes. There's versions where they say the Arabs said, "Leave your homes." And then
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:36.020]   when the war is over, you're going to come back and take everything. Some Arabs stayed in their homes
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.160]   and actually today they're Israeli citizens with full equal rights as other Israelis.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:48.140]   So that happened. Then in 1967, that's when Egypt attacked again. During that war again,
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:56.300]   Israel miraculously won. That was really the time where Israel was able to expand their territory.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.200]   They took over the West Bank at the time, which didn't belong to the Palestinians as much as it
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.880]   belonged to Jordan. It was part of Transjordan at the time. Then they also gained control of the
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.840]   Gaza Strip, which also was a part of the Gaza Strip. So that was a very important time for Israel.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.700]   It was previously administered by Egypt, although when Egypt was administering it,
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.720]   they didn't take it as their territory. They never granted citizenship to the people who were there.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:21.980]   So between 1948 and 1967, when the Six-Day War occurred, most of the leaders in the Arab world
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.480]   enjoyed leaving this issue out. It was a great way to stoke nationalism. And two,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.820]   it was a very easy political issue for them to have to say, "Well, we need to do this and to
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.660]   fight for the Palestinian people." So in a lot of ways, it was a way to deflect in their shortcomings
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.820]   at home and to justify certain actions they were taking because they were fighting for this group
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.440]   of people. Then it gets really interesting after the Six-Day War. So this was the second time that
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.960]   the Arab countries had failed to destroy Israel, which is what they had promised they would do.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.820]   So there's a young terrorist at the time named Yasser Arafat, and he was part of a party called
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.380]   Fatah. And what he said is, "You know what? All these Arab leaders, they're lying to you. They're
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.580]   failing you. I'm going to be the one to start creating a liberation and opportunity for the
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.480]   Palestinian people." So he took over. And then he took over the Arab countries. And then he took over
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.960]   the Arab countries. And then he took over the Arab countries. And then he took over the Arab countries.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.480]   He took on this mantle, was able to use his Fatah group and some pretty thuggery ways to take over
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.800]   the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which was a way that he got some international acclaim. And
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.740]   at the time, he was doing that from Jordan. So this is about 1968, 1969. They caused so much
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.140]   trouble in Jordan that King Hussein at the time, who was King Abdullah's father, who really was a
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:34.280]   very, very special diplomat and leader in the Middle East, got so fed up with Arafat. At the
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.300]   time, he was causing trouble. He was going to be the leader of the Arab countries. And then he
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.540]   it was it was steering people away people wouldn't invest there uh they wouldn't it was hurting
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.940]   terrorism and then they took a little further and they tried to assassinate him which was probably
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.260]   uh the final straw so the jordanian leader said get these people the hell out of my country
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:56.500]   um it was a big clash between the plo uh and and fata uh terrorists and then the jordanian police
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.060]   and military uh and they were able to expel them and then the palestinians went to lebanon uh
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.820]   that's where yasir our front was so they were there for about 12 years again they went back
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:12.660]   to their old ways of of fermenting uh radicalism and finding ways to cause trouble uh when israel
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:20.420]   invaded lebanon in 1982 then yasir fat fled again this time to tunisia in tunisia they were living
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.780]   pretty well as a beachfront place they're in these beautiful villas on the beach and they kind of
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.420]   became a little bit disconnected from the palestinian people but there was a lot of resentment
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:34.340]   of the broader arab world because they felt like again the arab world didn't really they would
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.860]   say they were for the palestinian people but never really stood up for them in the way that they
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.940]   felt like they deserved so it was it took until about 1988 that finally
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.460]   uh this is 40 years after 1948 the war of independence where uh the plo was finally
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.540]   able to get the arab league to say and this is really because jordan was just like done
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.380]   with this issue to say okay we're going to acknowledge that this land here should become
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:03.620]   a palestinian state so the notion of a palestinian state really didn't emerge until about 1987 1988
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.660]   uh which is the same time that hamas actually you know came about and they came about really from
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.900]   they were not shoot of the egyptian muslim brotherhood and their whole thing was basically
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:20.100]   we're gonna do full terrorism in order to prevent uh prevent any compromise or any deals with israel
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.820]   so then you go to 1991 which is a very very important
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:28.020]   time for the palestinians mostly because saddam hussein in iraq invades kuwait
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.380]   and that was very scary for a lot of the arab leaders right they didn't want they did fear saddam
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:40.020]   uh he was a he was seen as the radical arafat uh and the palestinian leadership backed saddam
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.180]   hussein mostly because they knew that he was seen as the revolutionary and popular with the more
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.820]   common man um and this pissed off every single gulf leader because they basically said wait
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.060]   this guy if he's going to take over kuwait he could come for saudi arabia he'd come for uae so
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.020]   they were all very against that and at the time there's about over 200 000 palestinians in kuwait
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.900]   what happened at that time though was that that made the palestinian leadership so weak because a
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   lot of the arab countries cut off the funding it was just done with them and that's really what led
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:12.020]   to the oslo accords so the oslo accords happened not because our fought necessarily you know all
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:18.820]   of a sudden said after you know 37 or 27 years of trying you know terror and and pushing forward uh
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.900]   he basically ran out of other options and this was his only way to get some form of legitimacy so
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.980]   they dropped from their charter uh the whole notion of destroying israel and said let's try to
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.380]   create this area we can have governance and try this whole effort for a palestinian state so
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:38.020]   that's really kind of that's a long short version of kind of how we got to then and then in the last
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:44.100]   i'd say 30 years the big change that i would say between then and today is that you have a lot you
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.940]   have a new middle east for me and a lot of the work we did in the trump administration was really
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:53.460]   to help what i'd call the new middle east emerge where you have a lot of economic opportunities now
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:30:00.260]   happening in saudi arabia uae qatar there's been a massive mind shift where if you go kind of post
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.740]   arab spring a lot of these leaders are saying uh you know how do we create opportunity for our
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:10.260]   people when i got into my job in 2017 all the experts were saying to me the big divide in the
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.900]   middle east is between the sues the the sunnis and the shias and when i got there i said no no
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.020]   the divide is between leaders who want to give opportunity and betterment of life to their people
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.780]   and people who want to use religion or or whatever issue they want to hold on to from the past in
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.180]   order to deflect from their shortcomings and justify bad leadership so um i think that's a
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.020]   really important thing to think about um so i think what's happened today is you have a lot of
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.580]   the gulf countries really wanting to see this issue uh get resolved which is different than
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.780]   you had in in camp david and in in 2000 when bill clinton was uh getting close to a deal with yasser
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.020]   arafat i think the saudis and others at the time didn't want this issue to go away but now the
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.820]   issue is really no longer useful for the arabs the only people it's useful to quite frankly is
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.580]   iran and that's why they've been backing hamas and hezbollah and all these other functions
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:00.180]   factions in order to continue their project of instability so uh the way i kind of view this peri
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.780]   right now is that the middle east today is way stronger uh than it's been in the past and this
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:11.140]   is what i would say the last gasp of iran and those who have you know pushed for destabilization
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.180]   and kind of this whole um you know islamist jihadist project at the expense of kind of a
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.660]   collaborative uh middle east which which would then will create a lot of opportunity uh for the
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:29.380]   next generation to to really thrive jared isn't there like at this point then like is it hard or
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:37.860]   easy to create an objective target we we call individuals that israel wants to target hamas but
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.900]   there's no card carrying members of hamas you don't wear a jacket that says i'm a member of hamas and
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:48.980]   walk around with an id card and there are some folks who are sympathetic who believe that hamas
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:57.700]   represents a resistance movement there are some folks who obviously feel terrorized and ruled over
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:04.260]   and there are some folks who support the cause but don't pull the trigger there are some folks who
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.300]   pull the trigger but don't want to support the cause but are being forced to by some
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:16.500]   reports how easy and how hard is it to really direct a military operation at such a fluid
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:24.260]   population that it's very hard to id and target and as we've seen in years past
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.620]   there's always another group that seems to emerge
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:35.380]   you cut off one group you get rid of al-qaeda isis emerges and there's this almost like you know
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:41.540]   fluid transition of uh of this intention and particularly in this gaza community it's very
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.660]   difficult perhaps to distinguish between who's hamas and who's not hamas so how do you actually
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:53.460]   achieve the objective there and you know how does the military target yeah so so that's probably the
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.220]   most important question that i think people have to um
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.900]   really be thinking about as we kind of enter this phase right so
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:06.820]   it's both how do you do this in the short term and then the long term and so you can't kill your way
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:12.260]   out of an ideology but there obviously are some bad leaders at the top who are culpable who um
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.660]   who who are military targets and i imagine that it's really you know knowing the capabilities of
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.140]   israel and the masad it's just a matter of you know when and how as opposed to anything else
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.340]   but then you have a lot of mid-level and and younger members of this group and i do think that
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.200]   a lot of these people are you know they're not they're not they're not they're not they're not
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.880]   in this situation more circumstantially i think this is what they've been taught to believe i
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.680]   think this is uh really the place they were and this was the the system in gaza where if you wanted
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.080]   to advance and live a better life then you really had to succumb to this uh tiered system so how
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   deep the ideology is um people will debate that in different ways if you go back to 2016 in the
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.200]   campaign when we were dealing with isis the talking point that everyone used was you have to defeat
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.520]   the territorial caliphate of isis and then you have to win the long-term battle against extremism
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.180]   uh one of the things that president
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:02.120]   trump did when he went to saudi arabia in 2017 uh the reason we went there was that the middle east
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.080]   was basically on fire i mean if you had isis had a caliphate the size of ohio they were ruling over
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.880]   eight million people they were beheading uh journalists and killing christians uh syria
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.680]   was in a civil war where 500 000 uh people were killed a lot of muslims and you didn't see the
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:21.080]   same protests on college campuses when that was happening as uh you know assad was gassing his
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:26.880]   own people uh libya was destabilized yemen was destabilized and iran was on a glide path to a
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:33.660]   nuclear weapon having just been given 150 billion dollars in cash through the disastrous jcpoa deal
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:40.420]   that uh that kerry and obama negotiated so it was a mess and so trump went there and um and basically
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.380]   was was pretty tough with what he said and he said this isn't our problem this isn't your problem to
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.820]   solve our problem and we need to to root this ideology get it out of your your homes get it
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.380]   out of your mosques get it out of this earth and uh the king of saudi arabia stood up at the time
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.720]   and said there's no glory in death and that was really important uh two of the things that we've
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.220]   talked about two of the big deals that came out of that people talk about the big investments did
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.260]   over 500 billion dollars of investments uh in arms sales with saudi arabia that created a lot of u.s
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.520]   jobs but the two agreements we made that didn't get a lot of coverage during that time was that
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.020]   we did a counter-terror finance center that we set up where we got all the gulf countries to really
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.040]   allow treasury to work closely with their banks to stop a lot of the funding to the terrorist
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.780]   organizations and then these kind of borderline organizations and the second one was in saudi
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.560]   arabia which is the custodian of the two holy sites in islam and the second one was in the
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.800]   islam mecca medina they started a counter-extremism center where basically they were combating online
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.320]   um radicalization that was occurring and if you remember in the us in 2016 we had the
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.460]   San Bernardino shooting we had the pulse nightclub shooting and a lot of people being radicalized
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.320]   online one of the things that I'm very proud of from the trump administration is the work
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.820]   that we did to really help saudi arabia change their trajectory and what I realized quickly
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.400]   was that in the us we just did not have the capabilities to win the long-term ideological
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.360]   battle ourselves so um we could be mad at you know saudi for some of the things that they've
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.860]   done in the past but they were the the most powerful partner we could have in order to
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:10.740]   uh try to uh combat uh the radicalization that was occurring both in terms of stopping the funding but
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.660]   also uh you know replacing the clerics who were doing the radicalization with the clerics who were
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:22.140]   uh restoring Islam to a more peaceful and more proper uh place so that was something that that's
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.260]   really current it's made a big difference I was just in saudi arabia a couple weeks ago at their
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.400]   economic investment conference and what was really exciting to me was I was meeting with a lot of the
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:36.420]   younger saudi entrepreneurs and I did a a conference in Bahrain to talk about the Palestinians in 2019
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.860]   and one of the big challenges we had when we were putting that together is we were thinking about
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.600]   who are the role models for these young Palestinian kids and in the in the Muslim
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.500]   world the you know they had some sports stars they had some business leaders but it wasn't
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:55.100]   really people who were necessarily relatable to a lot of the younger generation in saudi I was at an
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.600]   event with all these young tech entrepreneurs there who are building uh amazing companies a lot
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.460]   of Unicorns there they're doing a lot of the you know the companies that are dominant in the US and
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.360]   in Asia and now they're building them for the Middle East there and it's very very exciting and
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.280]   these really are the next generation of role models for a lot of these kids so uh that's a long
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.300]   way of saying that you know obviously you have to do what you have to do from a military perspective
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.400]   and the hope obviously is that it could be as quick as possible and that as few civilians as possible
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.440]   uh are hurt by this
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:30.080]   um but the notion is that once that's once that's completed you need to then create a framework
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.300]   where people don't just have more despair because in an area where there's no hope and opportunity
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.980]   then obviously the radicalists and the jihadists that's really where they do their best recruiting
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.720]   and they flourish so uh so so once this occurs there needs to be a paradigm created where the
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.520]   next generation feels like it's better for them to get a job be part of the economy uh and where
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.380]   they can live a better life through capitalism uh than by going to to these jihadist groups
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.940]   but it's leadership targeting right now that's the objective effectively I mean that's what I'm
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.500]   hearing is I think it's leadership and then degrading of capabilities right so because
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.760]   again what you've seen as well you've seen this with cartels in in in South America and you've
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.960]   seen this with terror organizations you know you you kill the top guy and sometimes you cut the
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.800]   head off the snake and the snake dies and sometimes it just you know it scatters into a lot of little
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.340]   pieces and then you end up it ends up becoming more complicated not less but I think here
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.260]   obviously leadership but but significantly degrading uh the capabilities for
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.980]   for anything in Gaza to uh to to threaten Israel and then actively build a better way
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:36.440]   actively build a better solution that's the only way and by the way even today it's it's much more
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.060]   easy to visualize that than it was in 2019 when I was talking about this because you're seeing the
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.380]   economic project in Saudi Arabia you're seeing what they're doing in UAE I mean the fact that
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.340]   Saudi shifted so much in five years should give you hope that it's really really possible and
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.780]   they've been pushing the rest of the countries to try to emulate and compete with them which is
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.200]   uh
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.180]   also an amazing thing I'd love to get your reaction to the difference in tone and messaging
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:04.340]   from Western governments versus what you're seeing sometimes on the ground with some of these
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:10.220]   protests and just how almost diametrically opposed the language and the rhetoric and the point of
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:15.800]   view is how is it that and sort of this is why I kind of asked you just for a little bit of a history
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:22.160]   how is it that people aren't taking all of these views in how is it that there is this
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.140]   radicalization that may not be a
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:29.660]   happening in the same level in the Middle East but is maybe happening actually in the West
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:35.840]   whether it's in our universities or other ones yeah so that's something like my friends in the
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.800]   Middle East a lot of them are laughing at the West because they're basically saying you know
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.000]   we we got all these Islamist radical Muslim Brotherhood people the hell out of our countries
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.400]   you don't see the same protests uh in those places that you see in the West and um and I
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.560]   think that in in in the West what's occurred is is people I saw this a lot when I dealt with the
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.880]   Europeans where people's understanding of the issue uh is more with their heart than it is
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.680]   with their head and obviously nobody wants to see any suffering um of any human beings but
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.900]   the reality is is that you know the the solutions that they've proposed for the last 75 years have
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.580]   all been uh just nonsensical they've more often than not perpetuated the problem than they've
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.140]   been solutions to the problem and you know I faced tons of criticism when I was you know in my role
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.580]   working on this issue and mostly because I I kind of looked at all the things that have been done in
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:27.200]   the past and keep my being asked to work on you know the Middle East it's like uh it's almost
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.460]   like a joke right it's it's the hardest problem set you can get in the world and I think we almost
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.620]   made it look too easy getting the results that we did and we left it very quiet and I think now
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.960]   people are starting to appreciate that it wasn't that easy and it's not um it's not a simple problem
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:48.020]   set to deal with and uh but I think that a lot of people um were were were kind of
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:54.380]   looking at um at what they thought was wrong but looking at the wrong fruit causes for how it got
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:01.880]   there I have a question for you and Sax I'd love to get your guys opinion on this India dealt with
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.760]   a terrorist attack when manohan Singh was prime minister and basically it was an extremist Muslim
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.860]   group from Pakistan Lakshari taiba that came in and killed a lot of Indians but a lot of
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:17.360]   foreigners as well right attacked some of the major hotels in Bombay Etc and
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:25.220]   what happened was manohan Singh didn't do anything and in hindsight what was written
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:33.920]   is you know they debated what to do they debated do we go after this group do we show some proactive
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.640]   demonstration of force do we invade Pakistan ultimately they went on a more covert path to
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.900]   sort of dismantle that terror Network and there was just a lot of international support that came
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:51.980]   around it can we steal men whether it would have been possible for netanyahu to take that path
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:58.220]   or was it really not even reasonable just curious what you guys think about that
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:08.900]   do you want to go first uh no you should go for a chair okay so um look at anything's possible uh
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.580]   chamath and I think that there's different ways look I think the big fears initially were that
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.540]   going into Gaza
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:19.520]   uh number one you'd be walking into a big trap and number two is you would be inviting a major
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.140]   escalation in the region the the third fear was obviously the degradation of the Israeli economy
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:30.380]   when we did the Abraham Accords one of the big uh attractive uh things to a lot of these countries
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.420]   to be partners with Israel was their massively robust economy and what could happen if they go
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.380]   to war and it's a prolonged war is that economy can go off track I think GDP will take a big hit
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.180]   there in Q4 but obviously you know in Israel they do have a history of coming back right away but if
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.100]   if this is a prolonged uh war effort uh there could be big hits and then you also think about in the
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.360]   age of you know AI and software development losing you know a day of productivity is the equivalent
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.560]   of losing you know a week or a month and uh and they don't want to fall behind in what they're
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.480]   doing so there is an argument to be made for doing that but I do think that from Israel's perspective
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.420]   um I do think that they understand this threat I think that they want to eliminate this threat
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:14.060]   and I think their view is is uh we we can't live like this anymore uh we underestimated it before
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.920]   uh and and we will not let that happen again and I think also the psychology of really the Jewish
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.660]   people is you know it's funny once I was sitting with uh with uh Prime Minister Netanyahu and one
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:28.280]   of the generals and uh and BB was basically saying like you know if Iran gets too close
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.400]   this is what I'm going to do we're going to have to take matters into our hands and the general
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.760]   basically said to me said you know I get it you know you guys aren't going back to the ovens and
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.080]   I was just like wow you know so it was a real acknowledgement of like the way that Israel
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.040]   operates with kind of no margin for error and I would always say when I would negotiate with the
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.940]   Israelis that you know sometimes you do a contract and there's like you know there's there's two issues
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.120]   that are a 10 and like a couple issues that are five and like a whole bunch you know a whole bag
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.500]   of issues that are like twos and threes and when I would negotiate with the Israelis like they would
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.820]   treat every issue like it was like a 10. you know what I mean in the sense that like they they just
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:04.400]   operate like there's no margin for error um and uh and I do think that obviously there was some
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.960]   complacency and and and the internal division you know led to them being caught off guard here but
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.980]   I think that uh they're going to do what they're going to do to make sure this this happens and I
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.360]   think there's also a way where Israel feels mentally like we have to show that we're strong
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.920]   or else people will will go after us and I think that that's what they've done and I will say you
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.360]   know the fact that Israel's gone from being completely divided to now uh fully United in
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.100]   this effort I mean even the people on the far left um in Israel who are all peace who are you
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.060]   know funding you know jobs with the Palestinians and you know housing them in their homes I mean
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.840]   they're basically saying they want to go to war so the mentality there is very much we need to
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.800]   do what we need to do now to keep ourselves safe people are very very uh heartbroken and they're
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.580]   heartbroken for those who are who are passed um they're they're praying very closely for the
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.680]   hostages um and uh but they've given a lot of latitude to their government to do what it needs
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.600]   to do to make sure this this is this is not uh this does not occur again and I will say too like
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:02.120]   Israel also recognizes that I think now they have the world more on their side uh than they have in
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:08.960]   in uh in past conflicts and I think their view is to um their view is to to do it while they
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.440]   have that situation sacks what do you think could Netanyahu have
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:19.700]   taken the the path of doing nothing no I don't think so I mean not given his domestic political
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:27.800]   situation I think the Israeli people demand a response and look one of the arguments that Israel
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:33.260]   would make is that if this happened to you the United States or you Russia or you China what
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:40.460]   would you do I mean I think we know we would turn Gaza into Fallujah or Mosul Russia would turn it
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.600]   into Grozny so I think
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:51.020]   Israel is taking the response that I think most countries would take and given their situation the
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.860]   thing I worry about is that Israel is not the United States I mean the United States because
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:46:00.380]   it's so powerful can act largely with impunity we don't have to worry as much about blowback
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.280]   and Israel does because at the end of the day they're a small country in a very hostile region
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.860]   and so I do worry about the potential for unintended consequences here one potential
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.540]   consequence is horizontal
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:15.500]   escalation does this war somehow spin out of control and it could lead to a much wider
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:20.120]   regional war that would not be in Israel's interest the other is diplomatic isolation
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.020]   because I do think that Israel is taking a big hit right now and the information war the war of
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.240]   Republic opinion and then finally you do have a lot of civilian casualties and and those civilians
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.080]   have brothers and sisters and cousins and so forth and that's going to lead to the next generation of
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:40.280]   terrorists and so even success in this operation against Hamas doesn't solve the long-term problem
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.480]   I mean it just kind of keeps it going
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:50.420]   going so I think all of those things are potential problems but at the end of the day if Israel can
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:56.780]   have a successful military operation here that significantly degrades or destroys Hamas without
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:04.280]   this thing spiraling out of control that buys them time to find a political solution then maybe it
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.120]   will be worthwhile I mean I think a lot depends here on what the outcome ultimately is I think
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.360]   it's like a very tough thing to judge without knowing what the outcome is going to be the
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:19.340]   the King of Jordan a couple of weeks ago gave a speech and in the speech he said there is no peace
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:25.100]   possible in the Middle East without the emergence of a Palestinian state with a two-state solution
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:30.020]   being the only path forward a Palestinian independent and sovereign state should be on June
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:37.460]   4th 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital and so that the cycles of killing whose ultimate
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.440]   victims are innocent civilians and
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:50.900]   is this the only path to stabilization Jared and is that where we're headed so that statement is is
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.980]   the same throwaway statement right that's the safest statement for anyone to say because that
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:59.660]   became the international consensus so you know one thing that was super interesting to me when
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:04.520]   I was working on this was um I kind of said to my team once I was like where does the Palestinian
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.380]   claim for East Jerusalem as the capital come from and I had a guy on my team who was a military guy
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.680]   who actually worked for John Kerry and I'd always have him in the room because he would represent
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.240]   the Palestinian perspective um because he had made a bunch of Orthodox Jews and you know we tried to
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.460]   be impartial but you know we did the best we could to have you know all perspectives represented and
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:29.540]   um and he came said I actually don't know and then what's interesting is you know when when the West
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:35.540]   Bank was actually governed by Jordan the capital at the time was Amman and so it really wasn't till
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.320]   the uh the the 1988 um uh uh
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.220]   launch of of this right for a Palestinian state that they self-declared that the capital should
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.600]   be East Jerusalem and so that was actually an interesting notion as well and I think that you
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.200]   know everyone knows that that's not going to be the case and I asked one of the leaders once why
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.860]   they say that and they said well it's a cliche and I said well maybe we need a new cliche and
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.600]   he says yeah that's a good idea let's come up with a new cliche so I think whatever solution
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.820]   is going to occur has to be pragmatic right you you the reality is is that if if we're
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:09.080]   going to learn from Gaza there's a couple of lessons to learn right number one is
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:16.460]   you know Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 or 2006. uh they forcibly removed 50 000 Israeli
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:21.260]   settlers uh from Gaza um all those people they they left their their homes they left their
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.240]   businesses um thinking that would be peace they they transferred governance of Gaza to the
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:31.820]   Palestinians the Palestinians then had an election again it was uh you know the the PA at the time
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.260]   convinced the Bush administration to allow for Hamas even though their charter called for the
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.660]   destruction of Israel to participate in the election
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.400]   and they won in a democratic election since that time there's been no improvement in the economy
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:49.700]   uh it's become a a real security risk for Israel and so Israel withdrew and then let them govern
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:55.400]   themselves and now you have what's happened today be the case so I I think the reality is is that
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:01.820]   you know if you look at the historical um maps and the historical lines I mean there's really no
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:08.240]   uh making a claim there's no other example in history where somebody's lost three offensive
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.680]   wars and then has been able to maintain their claim over a territory uh that they had before
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.420]   but I do think that there is an international consensus and I do even think in Israel there's
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:22.940]   consensus to give the Palestinian people the ability to kind of have their own land and then
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:28.580]   also to govern themselves so the word state is is a very loaded term because it comes with a lot of
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:34.820]   definitions to different people but I think the constructs of what's achievable is um is in the
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.180]   West Bank or Gaza there can be no security threats
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.500]   threat to Israel this is something that that they were insistent on before and I was sympathetic this
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.220]   was even before October 7th and if you go back and look at the work we did and what we put out
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:51.740]   we had a security regime that we designed with U.S intelligence and military and Israeli intelligence
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.900]   and Israeli military that we thought actually gave a lot of autonomy from police force perspective to
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.920]   the Palestinians allowed them to build their capabilities and and they kind of like earned
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.880]   their way into more and more security control which I thought was the right way to do that
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.000]   because you don't want to take a ton of risk there the other part of it though
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.340]   in any state is you need a functioning economy otherwise obviously you have a big grievance party
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:19.160]   the biggest problem the Palestinians have faced over the last called 25 years since since Oslo I
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:25.040]   guess almost 30 years now since Oslo is is just bad governance so the problem with the PA is is they
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:30.260]   were elected I think in 2005 and they haven't another election since so I think president boss
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:36.380]   is in the 16th 17th 18th year of like a four-year term very not popular he's more popular in
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.940]   Washington and in you know the United
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:44.060]   States than he is you know in his own country um he's uh it's a very corrupt system again a lot of
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:49.100]   the money's gone for uh for the leadership their family for the top people but not to the it hasn't
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:53.660]   trickled down to the people and so there's not a lot of trust on it uh you know I held a conference
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.920]   in Bahrain where I brought all the top investors in the Middle East I brought uh Steve Schwartzman
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.200]   from Blackstone came we had uh Randall Stevenson came from from AT&T and everyone came and said
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.340]   you know what we actually would love to help the Palestinian people we'd love to invest here
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.540]   uh and then they looked at the magnitude of it I mean it's three million people which is like a small
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.980]   state in the West Bank and two million in Gaza again it's like a small state in the U.S um and
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:20.240]   obviously to build things it's much cheaper I mean the GDP per capita there is about 3 000 per person
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.800]   so uh you know it's it's it's cheaper labor it's it's it's people do it and it's connected right to
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.660]   Israel right which is like you know California not being connected to Silicon Valley so the prospects
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:35.180]   for prosperity spillover are massive uh being sandwiched between the rich Gulf and the growing
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:40.880]   Israel so but the thing that's missing in for the Palestinians is very basic things right there's no
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:46.640]   fair judiciary there's no rule of law the governance is terrible the institutions are incredibly opaque
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.380]   and what all these people were saying is we'd love to invest here but it's just not an investible
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:55.760]   place and so the thing that's been holding back the Palestinian people has not been Israel it's
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.840]   been their bad leadership and again you're seeing in other places in the Middle East that with the
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.820]   proper leadership investments can come and those investments will actually lead to people living a
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:11.000]   much better life how does that leadership change in your view so the way that I would think about
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.500]   this is that if you're waiting for a solution to come to you you're not going to find it right if
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.580]   you say okay let's go back to the UN well they have a perfect track record of failure let's go
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.880]   back to the PA well they have a perfect track record of failure you're definitely not going
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.140]   to go back to a mosque so you need to find something different so I think you either need
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:32.720]   to create something new or you need to um look at what's working and put it together so some places
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.760]   that could do it I mean the World Bank has a lot of good
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.780]   uh institutional knowledge they helped us work on the plan the World Bank and the IMF
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:43.220]   uh you know some of the other regional governments I mean Jordan their government is pretty pretty
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.880]   capable I mean they're they're better at military than economy but I think they're they're starting
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:53.120]   to focus more on economy as they realize that that's necessary if you look at the benefits of
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.420]   that area the Palestinian people are are like a 99 literacy rate again through the taxpayer US
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.220]   taxpayer dollars in international donations we've paid them to become very educated unfortunately I
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:08.420]   think we've poisoned uh their minds with a lot of what's been taught in their curriculums
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.680]   um they have a pretty good health care system there again I think it could be improved because
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:17.600]   it's been done very kind of piecemeal versus holistic and then in addition to that they
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.920]   obviously have a tremendous amount of tourism sites I mean you know Jewish Christian Muslim
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.780]   tourism sites so if they ever get their acts together I mean the boom in that area can be
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:32.300]   uh unbelievable and I think it could work very very well there was one time where the Palestinian
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.920]   economy was working I think it was about
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:39.680]   2007 there was a guy named Salam Fayyad who was the first time somebody came in who was uh he was
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:45.080]   not corrupt things were happening uh you know wages were rising uh projects were moving the
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:49.520]   money was actually getting to the people and he became so popular because he was such a doing such
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.020]   a good job administering that uh that the president got rid of him that a boss got rid of him because
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:58.040]   he saw him as a threat to his power so you know what's happened is not different right you always
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:03.560]   have kind of a tyranny of the minority in some way uh with with with most forms of of government and
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.780]   so uh what happened was is as he was starting to gain popularity he became a threat to kind of the
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.980]   cronyism that occurred and so I think that the international community if they're going to put
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:18.380]   money into this again to either rebuild number one it has to be conditions based again we've put
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.880]   tens of billions of dollars into this situation right I mean this this refugee group has gotten
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:28.520]   more money over time than any refugee group in history by a factor of maybe a hundred right and
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:33.980]   then you know you you've none of it's been conditions based and it has to be in in a set
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:37.700]   where people are trying to create outcomes I think one of the problems is a lot of the people working
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.420]   on this don't have business backgrounds they understand you know human rights or they
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.260]   understand politics but they don't understand capitalism and they don't understand what kind
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:50.900]   of framework you need in order to allow a society to thrive has Treasury ever tried to trace these
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:56.780]   dollars or some other organization to just show where the theft happened and where these pools of
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:02.660]   money have gone to there's some intelligence on it that I can't go into but uh but I think most
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:07.160]   people don't want to know to be honest I mean you could just look at it in a couple of ways like you
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:12.260]   know you look at um you know we would meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Washington and he
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.880]   would take a commercial ll flight to come meet us and he runs a military superpower an economic
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:23.240]   superpower in the region uh President Abbas would come visit us in Washington and he uh obviously
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.480]   represents a refugee group and he would fly in a 60 million dollar
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.400]   Boeing business jet a private jet to Washington I mean I'd meet with him and we'd be sitting around
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:35.360]   and uh you know he'd put a cigarette in his mouth and then somebody would come over and they'd like
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.540]   the cigarette for him and I'd be like am I meeting with the head of a refugee group I'm meeting with
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:43.880]   like a thing you know it's just it was a different situation and um but I think people just but he's
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:49.160]   the reasonable one right the alternative is Hamas and those guys I mean those are billionaire
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:56.180]   hypocrites who live in Qatar at the four seasons right yeah but but my sense is is you're you're
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:56.460]   going to get a lot of money and you're going to get a lot of money and you're going to get a lot of money
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.720]   at what you demand right and I think that from the U.S's perspective right we give about four billion
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:08.040]   dollars a year in foreign aid to the PA to UNRWA to Jordan to Egypt and uh and we've we've tolerated
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:12.780]   you know status quo that's not acceptable and you know one of the difference again Trump had a lot
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:17.040]   of tension with the foreign policy you know establishment and it was over a lot of things
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:21.240]   right obviously he wanted to end the forever Wars uh he felt like we should get some return on the
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:26.160]   investments we were making he felt like USAID wasn't an entitlement um but I think the biggest
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:30.360]   difference was they wanted to all maintain the world they wanted just to manage it and he wanted
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.620]   to change it and you know what we did by the by the time again this was one of the disagreements
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:39.300]   I had with the incoming administration um is that when we turned over the Middle East to them again
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:44.460]   we I spoke earlier about what a mess uh you know we kind of inherited when we started but we had
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:50.880]   uh five peace deals between Israel and majority Muslim countries uh Iran was totally broke again
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.860]   under Obama uh when he left they were selling about 2.6 million barrels of oil a day
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:00.120]   under Trump when he left office they were selling a hundred thousand barrels of oil a day they were
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:04.920]   out of foreign currency reserves they were dead broke uh now they're back up to three million
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:10.320]   barrels a day of sales they've done over a hundred billion dollars uh of oil revenue uh since we left
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:15.000]   office the Palestinians you know one of the things we did uh after I think the first year is we cut
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.900]   the funding to under us very controversial we're saying oh this is for refugees we said it's not
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:22.560]   for refugees it's to build Terror tunnels and rockets and they're saying no it's for schools
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   and hospitals and we were saying those are the military bases and they were saying you guys
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:31.380]   are crazy you're cruel and our whole thing and so when we left the PA was was basically broke
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.420]   um the Arabs had kind of lost interest in in that cause uh because they kind of saw that it was it
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:41.100]   was morally bankrupt and that uh every time we gave a boss the opportunity to do something better
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:46.200]   for his people he refused and and they kind of saw that you know we kind of we smoked him out
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:50.160]   a little bit and so we kind of took the issue and we shrunk it tremendously and the final deal
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.260]   we did was between Qatar Saudi Arabia UAE Egypt and Bahrain and that
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:01.080]   was a critical uh deal to do because that was what really made it possible for uh Saudi and
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:05.580]   Israel to then do the deal and that was really on the table right when we left but it took too
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:09.960]   much time they allowed Iran to get too strong they started allowing Iran to get money they started
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:15.120]   funding the Palestinians and and under again and uh and now you have a situation where it's just
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.840]   become you know a mess it could be fixed it definitely can be fixed if you're strong and if
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.400]   you're smart but if you're going to go back to kind of the old ideas you're going to get the
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.800]   results you need new ideas you need to create the ideas and force them you can't just wait for them
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.280]   to occur and then go back to the old institutions and the old people who have failed before
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:37.740]   who do you think should be Secretary of State in the next administration I think Jared should
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:45.180]   let me ask you about the two-state solution let's just double click on this I mean my view
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.780]   on this and I think by the standards of Israeli politics I'd be a liberal there
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:53.100]   is that the only solution the only way out of this is the two-state solution
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:59.340]   you know we can't have a situation of indefinite permanent occupation of the Palestinian people
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.840]   at some point they developed a national Consciousness and if you have conditions
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.440]   of permanent occupation they're going to resist and you're going to have outbursts of terrorism
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:16.200]   at the same time if Israel just outright annexes these territories or continues on a program of
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.220]   call it creeping annexation or keeps building settlements in the West Bank and you have a
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.200]   greater Israel that
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.780]   eventually Jews in Israel will not be the majority of the population I think if you look at kind of
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:34.740]   greater Israel there's about 7.3 million Jews there's about 7.3 million Palestinian Arabs so
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:42.660]   if if the plan is a single greater Israel it's either going to stop being a Jewish state because
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:48.120]   you know the Palestinians will vote for something different or it'll continue being the Jewish state
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.140]   but there's going to be some sort of two-tier system where a lot of Palestinians won't have the
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:52.500]   vote
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.000]   and so eventually a greater is will have to choose between whether it wants to be Democratic or
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.200]   whether it wants to be Jewish and that seems like a very bad choice it seems like we want both those
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.200]   things to be true so again that kind of brings you back to a two-state solution as the only option
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.980]   here and yet it seems to me that the two-state solution has never been further away it seems like
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:20.760]   it's never been further away in terms of Israeli domestic politics and it's never been further away
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.200]   in terms of having a
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:29.700]   negotiating partner to negotiate something like this with so that would be sort of my pessimistic
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.540]   Outlook I mean I know you're pretty optimistic about the situation do you see it differently
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:39.900]   than that is that framing wrong somehow how would you how would you see it okay so number one is I'm
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.820]   naturally optimistic and I I just find it's more fun to be optimistic than pessimistic but I'll say
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.560]   everything I'm saying in the context of the fact that this is a really really really really hard
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.700]   problem set right so
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:57.360]   um I'll try to say this um in the right order so number one is I I don't think there's any
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.960]   viability to a one state and I don't think that that's something that will ever occur
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.780]   um number two is um and I'll actually you know what's interesting one of the problems is a lot
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:11.160]   of the uh the Arabs and the Palestinians would actually prefer to be part of Israel than a
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.500]   Palestinian state so right before covid we released the Trump peace plan which uh which again you can
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.600]   you can still find online and uh I think the political part of it was about 54 pages the economic
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.120]   part and the political part is about 181 pages in detail um we at the time got the right wing and
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.680]   the left wing again it was they were in the third election and we had uh Prime Minister Netanyahu and
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.920]   Benny Gantz who's also an amazing um person came in and they all endorsed it and so what I would
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.300]   find what I tell you is that semantics you know state has to do a lot with semantics so you can
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.560]   definitely give them a state the question is is you know you have to give Israel certain overriding
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.300]   security controls so that uh so that the state cannot be a threat to them and then you can let
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.780]   them kind of earn their way out of that with good behavior and and showing that it's a true
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:59.700]   partnership but what I will just tell you is that whatever you call it you give them a flag you can
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.320]   give them whatever you want unless there's a system where people can live a better life then
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.600]   the grievance will overtake uh will overtake whatever Independence they have and it will just
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.760]   become a problem again and so um so I do think a two-state solution is is possible again what you
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:21.000]   do with Gaza is very much you know TBD um but I do think especially in the West Bank there's definitely a possibility
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.380]   to do it and I think that from Israel they'd like to see that happen where uh they'd like the
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.700]   Palestinians to be able to govern themselves but it's it's a couple big ifs if it's not a security
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:33.540]   threat and if they can have a viable economy that's going to happen one of the big things
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.740]   that's happening now that I'm hearing about is that I think the number was like 250 000
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:43.020]   Palestinians who had worked visas from the West Bank to uh to go into Israel and now with the
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.040]   threat there's just such a great distrust that has that has occurred that those are now not being
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.700]   renewed so I think Israel is going to have to bring in workers from other parts of the world but that
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:56.160]   is an amazing thing right you had Muslims and Jews uh you know working together you had uh you know
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.780]   Palestinians whose lives were better off because they were working with Israel so the vast majority
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:04.800]   of the Palestinians maybe not the vast I don't know it's people have different perspectives on
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.780]   this but I I just believe that fundamentally human beings want to live a better life uh I don't think
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.640]   our natural state is is to hate each other or to be uh or to not be together again if you look at
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.740]   the Middle East for you know a thousand years before the Second World War I mean Jews and Muslims and
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.880]   Christians they lived very peacefully together so you know what I was seeing with the Abraham Accords
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.440]   and what I was hoping would occur would really be a reversion to the pre-World War II error where
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.000]   people were starting to live peacefully together but there's been a lot of hate that's been fermented
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.500]   and manipulated over over this time but the best way to start it is just you know take it one day
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.220]   at a time you know we used to say in government we get a hard problem you know used to say you
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.000]   know how do you eat an elephant you know one bite at a time and so you just have to kind of outline
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.200]   where you want to get to put in place the right system and then just start you know step after step
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.580]   and then you get to a place and maybe you're able to do something that becomes viable with time
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:05:01.740]   Jared did you see the um debates last night did you watch them uh no I did not sex did you watch them
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:08.340]   uh I didn't watch the whole thing I've seen clips on social media do you have any takeaways I mean
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:13.800]   was it even worth watching yeah I thought I thought the the clips did a pretty good job of
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:19.140]   actually showing some of the punchier moments but the crazy thing is that the the mainstream media
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:27.240]   has completely erased Vivek's candidacy I don't even think it exists in the eyes of the mainstream
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:34.320]   media but if you look on on X all the posts were like he clearly won and he was basically throwing
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   fireballs everywhere but then if you go to you know CNN or Fox you don't even hear his name right
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:47.040]   so it's it's a real real difference the mainstream media coverage is what they want you to believe and
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.840]   social media is what actually happened
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.580]   it's what people actually believe and I think that if you look at social media
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:06:01.740]   what it shows is that Vivek dominated the debate and he was throwing fireballs and he was slamming
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:09.900]   the neocons on the stage and showing that there's been I think an irreparable break between the
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:15.660]   neocon establishment the Republican Party and the more Populist maga wing so I think that's
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.040]   that's kind of what social media is showing and then you know if you listen to mainstream media
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.480]   there they they said they talked about Vivek it said he had some sort of meltdown and he insulted
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.460]   Nikki Haley's daughter or whatever or something like that about her tick-tock usage yeah by the
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:34.620]   way all he said is that they he was being berated for why he created a tick-tock account and he's
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:40.680]   like I want to reach young people you know like your daughter who's on there and um yeah that's
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.580]   what he said and Nikki Haley called him scum for that well no but she also she also pulled like the
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:53.160]   Will Smith line like get your my daughter's name out your mouth did she slap him no she didn't I
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.180]   think it's a pretty good point there's like 75 million young Americans on TikTok if you want to
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:02.880]   reach them that's where you post your messages I have seen Vivek's stuff on there I've seen RFK
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:09.960]   Juniors videos on there like everyone uses TikTok now if you want to reach people that's just reality
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.160]   Nikki Haley doesn't
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.080]   I'm not sure I don't know that she has much of a social media following because I don't think
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:23.340]   her campaign inspires any real grassroots I think her campaign is supported and propped up by the
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.960]   GOP establishment wing I don't think there's any market for what she's selling among the grassroots
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.160]   so social media is kind of pointless for her but if you actually want to reach people especially
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:39.060]   young people use social media well it's pretty intense when Vivek said that the the head of the
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:40.980]   RNC should just be fired for all the losing
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.960]   and kind of went through every single election in the midterms and whatnot that they've lost since
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.900]   she became the head of the RNC and apparently on social media uh she mouthed something to the
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:59.160]   effect of this guy's an a-hole he's not gonna get a single cent from us yeah no it's Ronna McDaniel
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:04.800]   who I know I mean I like Ronna but I mean has she done a good job sex look I it's hard for me to
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.480]   speak to the job she's actually done because I don't know the activities are actually involved in
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.620]   being RNC chair
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:17.880]   so but I mean Vivek's point is look at the results so if we were on the board of a company that kept
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.680]   missing quarter after quarter and the CEO said no look at all the good things I'm doing we would
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:27.720]   probably still fire that CEO just because you're like how do things get worse right you just take
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.400]   the chance that you bring in a new CEO they're going to do better so the reality is our results
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.540]   in the Republican Party have been shitty lately now is that all Ronna's fault no it may not be
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.240]   much of her fault at all but how do you do worse
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:47.400]   I think a big reason for the crappy results have been the abortion issue we've now had
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:53.880]   this issue on the ballot in at least six states most of which were red states a couple of them
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.460]   were purple states it's lost every time the anti-abortion or pro-life side has lost decisively
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:06.180]   every time and I think there's a lot of reasons to vote Republican I think Republicans have the
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.060]   advantage on the economy on border
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:17.460]   on anything related to to woke on um Prime and homelessness these are all issues that should be
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:24.660]   big winners for Republicans but the public by I think probably a two-thirds majority does not want
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:30.780]   to ban abortion and as long as that issue is in the Forefront Republicans are going to lose and
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:35.820]   actually it was Ann Coulter who just said this Ann Coulter had a really good blog post about this
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:42.960]   saying that the pro-life yeah I retweeted it by the way she's very pro-life I mean she's a social
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.400]   conservative but she says that pro-lifer is going to wipe out the Republican Party they need to
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:53.340]   focus on non-political activities which is winning over hearts and minds they have to make the case
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.380]   to the country they have to persuade more people because they're not in a position they are not
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:02.220]   popular enough to actually win elections you concur Jared you think the Republican Party is
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.220]   going to change their position or need to change their position to win
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:10.320]   elections presidential election aside well ultimately if you don't win then you can't
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.700]   govern and you can't impact the changes you want to do so I do think that uh people are definitely
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:18.600]   paying attention you know the results are the results I will say that you know one thing with
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.340]   with Trump he won you know with his operation we were able to over perform our polling I think here
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:28.500]   in these last times there's been under performance of polling and so that's something that obviously
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.880]   you have to look at which is uh very troubling but I'll also say that with you know what I found
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.560]   again you know I'm not really um
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.360]   as somebody who was newer to the Republican Party what I found is that you know both parties are
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.680]   really I would say collections of of tribes right you have different tribes that kind of make up the
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.300]   party but what I found in the Republican Party was that there was a ton of infighting and finger
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.980]   pointing and purity tests and um you know instead of saying like you know you know I'm happy you
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.720]   agree with me on on 70 or 80 it was basically saying well if you don't agree with me on 100
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.820]   then then you're a bad Republican and I think that uh that's a that's a culture that's going to lead
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.680]   to you having very strong opinions but having no ability to effectuate things I think that people
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.900]   have to you know say where do we agree on on different issues uh that uh where do we agree
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.740]   on issues how can we work together to do it but if you don't win then you're not gonna be able to
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.980]   effectuate the things you want and even worse the other side is going to be effectuating the things
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:24.300]   they want and you look at where the world is today because of that there's a lot of internet fighting
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:30.240]   in the Republican Party I think Trump's instincts on abortion actually have been very good I said
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.820]   this a couple of months ago there was kind of a brouhaha on the right when Trump gave an interview
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:41.520]   in which he said that that actually went to Santa's had done in Florida with the six-week ban was a
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.800]   mistake and that he sort of up leveled the issue and just said I'm going to find a compromise that
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.600]   makes everybody happy and this created a lot of upset people on the right because they thought
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.620]   that Trump was kind of selling them out on the abortion issue and I made this case on Megan
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.120]   Kelly a couple months ago that I thought that what Trump was doing was pretty smart
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.180]   because he doesn't want to get pinned down on an issue that's going to hurt him in the general and
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:10.740]   I think part of the reason why he was being a little bit cagey on that issue is because he
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:16.500]   knows it would hurt him in the general and he's starting to think about that and I think the
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.300]   results that we just had the other day are strong vindication of that and just let me say just more
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:28.380]   generally that whenever Trump has opposed Republican groups think on an issue I think he's invariably
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.340]   been proven correct
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:36.600]   if you go all the way back to 2016 you know think about all the heresies that he committed in the
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.980]   Republican Party he spoke out against the forever Wars against Bush's forever Wars I think he was
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:46.800]   right about that at the time the Republican Party either wasn't talking about immigration or didn't
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.900]   really seem to care he basically made the border a huge issue I think it's proven right about that
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.440]   the issue of China and China trade was not a issue in the Republican Party if anything it was sort of
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.420]   the issue of China and China trade was not a issue in the Republican Party if anything it was sort of
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:04.320]   if anything it was sort of this the sort of unreconstructed free trade total free trade
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.540]   issue Brian was pushing the TPP value right exactly so Trump defied the orthodoxy on that I think it's
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:14.760]   proven correct Paul Ryan also wanted to ratchet back entitlements like Social Security Medicare
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.500]   and Trump thought that was suicidal for the GOP so he opposed that I think on all these issues
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:25.260]   whenever he has defied the orthodoxy he's been proven correct and um you know I don't know if
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.360]   it's a conscious thing or it's just that he's got tremendous
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:33.060]   gut instincts as a politician be curious to get Jared's take on that like how much of this is sort
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:39.180]   of him working things out and how much it is just his gut but I think this is why he stole the
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:44.520]   candidate to beat for the Republican nomination is at the end of the day for all of Trump's issues
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.240]   he's actually the best politician in the Republican Party you know I would see the
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.800]   way that he would work on trade and again uh you know trade deals usually take five six years and
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.300]   and you know his attitude on on trade was that whenever there's a multilateral it's
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.320]   the the weaker countries all ganging up on the stronger party and so he says like I want to do
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.360]   them bilaterally so he withdrew from TPP uh which everyone went crazy and said it was a disaster
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.460]   well we ended up negotiating with Japan and Korea and everyone and we got basically 95 of the market
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:15.540]   access that was in TPP without giving up any of the things that would have absolutely decimated
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:20.940]   our auto industry we renegotiated the the nafta which you know everyone said Obama said they would
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:25.800]   Bush said he wanted to fix it uh meanwhile Trump came in in a year and a half we renegotiated nafta
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.540]   and got over 80 votes in the Senate it was a bipartisan uh win and it set the highest standards
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:35.580]   for labor protection it did a lot of great things uh that I think make America way more competitive
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:40.680]   and hopefully will reduce our trade deficits so these were all things that he took on that people
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.940]   weren't willing to and again he said you know look if I'm wrong you know putting tariffs on
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.720]   these different countries I remember people coming into him saying uh say if you put these tariffs on
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.540]   the whole world's going to explode the U.S economy is going to blow up and I remember
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:55.740]   sitting with him privately and he said to me you know Jared I literally we had a year
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.220]   of debate and we had some people who were more religious about this issue than anything else
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:04.860]   and he says you know Jared I've been saying this for 30 years I believe it uh I campaigned on it
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:08.940]   I won on it I have to see it like I have to see it through it you know what if it turns out it's
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.960]   a big disaster I can always take him off you know and so that was kind of like his way of thinking
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.620]   about it where he had his instinct he followed his instinct but he knew he could always back
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:21.300]   off and I think his flexibility and unpredictability were some of his greatest assets and I think also
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:25.200]   on on the border and immigration again it's an issue with somebody you know grew up you know in
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.160]   the United States and then was living on the Upper East Side that I didn't a lot of resonance for but
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.640]   now you're seeing my friends in New York now they're getting a taste of what it can do you
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.240]   know to the country they're they're becoming you know big immigration Hawks like Trump the
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.640]   thing that the Republicans need to realize right now is that if you pick these topics
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.200]   that go down a rabbit hole you're going to be in a really tough spot in the general because
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:52.380]   the economy is also going to be in reasonable shape now if we were going to go into a November
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.620]   election where there were we were going to be in a recession that's very bad for Biden
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:01.680]   but sort of the tea leaves for whatever it's worth all the predictions all the predictive markets
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:07.320]   show that we're going to be in a reasonable place and so the Republicans get need to get very very
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.120]   focused acts as you say on the real issues list here right because they're not going to have the
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.280]   benefit of the tailwind of a bad economy to say President Biden has done a bad job necessarily
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.540]   and so the message will need to be even more precise and focused and so I think that that's
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:25.560]   going to be an important thing I did a little tea leaf reading on macro if you guys want to
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:31.560]   I have some charts yeah just let me just give you a little rundown of because I I went and I you know
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:38.160]   look we used to talk about these things when I was when we were doing a lot of forecasting going into
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:46.260]   this cycle but so here's like a couple of really interesting observations so the first one is when
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:52.920]   you look at this M2 money supply look how much it's actually shrunk now why that's interesting
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.500]   to me is that you have these two
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.660]   forces that are opposing each other one is we have these huge deficits so we're technically
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:07.380]   still frankly issuing a lot of money right but then on the other side we have QT so when debt
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:13.620]   rolls off we're not reissuing it and the balance of that is still a really constructive thing where
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:18.480]   now you can see that you know M2 has materially started to shrink and I think that that's a really
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:24.360]   positive thing because now what that does it combats inflation in a good way unfortunately
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.440]   for all of us it hurts
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.360]   financial assets which is not so good I think we've all felt that pain but the reality is that
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:36.480]   that's been working so then Nick if you go to the second chart so what you see now is like we are in
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.220]   a really decent place with inflation and if you think about what's going to happen over the next
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:48.540]   six months it's mostly in the bag and meaning we talked about this before but there's a lag effect
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:55.380]   on a handful of components specifically rents which when you roll them into this inflation rate
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:01.080]   you're going to see it really really turn over very quickly right so we know that inflation is
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:08.160]   falling it's going to fall even more the second thing Nick the third chart here is you can see
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.540]   that now validated in these 10-year break events remember this was the chart we used to look at
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:18.840]   when we were like holy mackerel something's going to break in November of 21. I think
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:24.420]   we probably should have just sold everything we had in November 21. we didn't do it but the point is
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.020]   now we know
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:30.780]   and what you see here is the 10-year break evens are also telling us okay guys we're going to be
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:37.080]   in a pretty decent place and so I think the setup is basically the following there's less money in
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.380]   the system that's a positive Nick if you show the last chart there's more money on the sidelines and
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:49.080]   this is just a picture of I mean look at the amount of money in money market funds six trillion and
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:54.960]   growing so that's a really positive sign which is that money will need to find a home
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:02.280]   once we have once well no even just now because you're gonna you're gonna be in a situation where
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.540]   and I'll get to this in a second but companies are now starting to perform because they've been
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:11.640]   able to re-baseline against very very lowered expectations right and and money managers have
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.200]   to do their job and deploy capital and that's something we mentioned I think last week but
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.700]   this is now the beginning of the new fiscal year for the entire mutual fund complex
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.300]   so that's trillions of dollars that have to get deployed because
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:29.940]   even though you pay them a very small fee per year you're not paying them to hold cash you're
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.920]   paying them to make decisions and own assets and then as you said freebird the last part of this is
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:41.220]   now you introduce rate cuts and that's a real accelerant now more than likely I think what that
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:47.640]   means is that markets are set up to do pretty well equity markets specifically and so I went and I
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:52.380]   looked at the data and I said well how can we see some data that proves that this is happening and
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:59.160]   what's amazing is if you look at the performance of what I would call the most risk adjusted seeking
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:04.860]   companies so those are tech businesses that have been absolutely hammered what you see in the last
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:12.360]   month is they have gone just nuclear adyen up 30 in a matter of a week doordash is up you know 25
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:17.580]   30 percent in a matter of a week Datadog up 30 percent in the matter of a week these are the
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:24.600]   businesses that were just completely decimated so what is all of this saying I think what what
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:30.660]   it's kind of saying is inflation is very much in the rearview mirror rates are going to get cut by
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:36.060]   the middle part of the year the economy looks like it's going to be a soft landing that is
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:41.580]   actually very beneficial for the sitting president it's also good for equities it's good for us
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:47.520]   so it's really interesting actually I think we've had a fundamental kind of now change Jared do you
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.400]   think it could still have an effect on the election cycle I think it definitely could but I
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.920]   do think a lot of people are still very concerned I know the the the the inflation the the wages
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:02.880]   wage inflation is still about four percent I think that people are um are still just nervous about
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.880]   what could come I think there's been a lot of shocks and there's been a couple of times where
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.900]   it's felt that way and I think that you know election years traditionally bring a lot more
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:13.740]   volatility to the market because there's unpredictability about what the policy will
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.460]   be going forward so I think that of people who have kind of been a little uh
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:22.620]   whiplash from the the transition of over the last year to 18 months see that they're going
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:27.180]   into another cycle of uncertainty I do think that you know now you're actually getting paid to not
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.860]   do anything uh with your money in those money market accounts so there's less of a maybe less
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:37.260]   of a FOMO to kind of go out and do something uh there so so I think that a lot of people are still
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:41.160]   going to be very much in kind of wait and see mode and obviously look for for special opportunities
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:47.400]   which I think will only further exacerbate uh a potential decline as well Jared last week we talked
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.880]   about real estate you used to be in the real estate business what do you have any thoughts
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:57.300]   on commercial real estate and how good bad average things are so I still have a lot of
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:01.740]   exposure to commercial real estate through my family's company and uh we're mostly in the
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.560]   multi-family space I think the office space right now is in for a massive uh change in the industry
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.580]   I think you're going to see a lot of the older buildings get uh get transitioned a lot of them
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:17.340]   are trading now for below uh land price which is which is pretty remarkable I think you have um you
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:21.300]   also have a transition kind of what are the cities of growth right so you look at a place like San
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.800]   Francisco and there's a big debate over whether you know AI is going to save you know the office
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.120]   market there or whether it's kind of like the Detroit of this Industrial Revolution and it's
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   just never going to come back and then you're seeing a lot of these San Francisco companies
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.260]   move to New York and the New York people are saying oh there's too much crime and homelessness
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:42.480]   and they're saying compared to San Francisco this looks like uh you know a super it's a beautiful
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.280]   place and so you know New York is still doing I think okay but you're seeing a lot of plays
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.660]   throughout the country that that are but the fundamental with real estate is it's correlated
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:55.320]   to interest rates and so you know if interest rates you know right now I think the 10 years
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.520]   like four and a half if it goes up to to six and you're just going to see it repricing and real
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.500]   estate assets if it settles at at four and a half five then you'll you'll probably see more stability
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.880]   and what that will be but ultimately uh real estate's become much more institutionalized
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.440]   over the last call it two decades and it's really a function of you know what are your your rent and
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.220]   expense growths and then what kind of what can you borrow at and can you create you
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:22.620]   a positive yield that's hopefully a good hedge against inflation so I I think net it will be
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.680]   a great asset class I mean it's probably one of the biggest asset classes in the world
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:30.960]   um I think right now though a lot of people are just holding back because they're not certain what
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.700]   the what the uh what the multiples or cap rates as they call them in real estate are going to be
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:39.960]   on a forward basis but they're really going to be a function of of what's the growth in the economy
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:47.160]   going to be and then also uh what the forward interest rates will be that's fair I think that
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.360]   the things challenged in real estate I mean the demand size challenge because you've had the whole
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.520]   work from home covet disruption and a lot of cities haven't fully come back I think New York's come
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:01.200]   back at this point but like San Francisco definitely hasn't I think New York is something
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.340]   like 95 of workers are back in the office I think in San Francisco it's only like 45
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:11.940]   so you've got demand issues then you've got financing issues you know um refinancing is
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:15.660]   much more expensive because interest rates are higher and then you've got these cap rate issues
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.100]   where no one knows what the
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:21.720]   long-term valuations are going to be so everything's a mess and by the way that gets
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.920]   compounded by the fact that now banks that have office exposure are pulling back their lending
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.720]   so you have a combination of you know cost of borrowing being higher and then the availability
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:35.580]   availability of liquidity going lower and that could further compound a lot of these refinances
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.820]   but a lot of what the people I know in the industry are telling me is that they're able
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:43.200]   just to work with existing lenders and just do some kind of uh extension and and you know just
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.040]   kind of live to fight for another day to get through the cycle and I will say in New York that
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.980]   the the rental rates for residential I think are at a historic highs and and actually what my family
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.180]   seen in their portfolio is that their properties in Jersey City which is basically like the sixth
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:01.320]   borough of New York are just absolutely on fire because it's basically you know you go in New York
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:06.180]   now you go to a CVS everything's locked up you can't buy anything it doesn't feel necessarily
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.320]   like the safest City you go to Jersey City they actually have like you know law and order and rule
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.000]   of law and so um so you still take a train to New York and that's actually been a place that's done
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.260]   incredibly well so you always have micro markets and you have different Trends that that work and
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.820]   don't work but uh but I wouldn't bet against New York it's still an amazing City and one thing about
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:28.980]   New York is every time I'm there I always talk with some of the cops and I basically ask them I
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:35.100]   say if you had a mayor that said uh go be cops go be cops nobody's gonna you know hold you back you
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:39.180]   know get out of the car do what you do we got you back how long would it take you to clean this place
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:42.780]   up and the answer I get is usually anywhere from like three months to six months so like we could
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.940]   have this place fixed so clearly they just have to let us be
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:49.680]   cops again and um and so I am hopeful that you know eventually there will be the political will
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:54.060]   to just you know let New York be what is it has the potential to be it's such an amazing dynamic
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:26:00.360]   place it's such a good point I mean it really is is just a matter of political will yeah if
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.660]   you hire more cops and let them do their job that will stop the crime or certainly the incentive for
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:10.080]   crime right now people think they can get away with this stuff and they don't get prosecuted
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:14.520]   when they get caught the jails are like a revolving door yeah they have plenty of cops they just have
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.540]   to do their jobs and they need prosecutors who will who will do their jobs as well and I worked
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:22.740]   at Manhattan District Attorney's office when I was at NYU law for the summer I mean you have amazing
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:27.480]   people there and if they are allowed to kind of follow the procedures and just just do the job
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:33.060]   in the way it's been done before uh you could make that city very very safe very quickly we
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:37.620]   actually have a cop shortage in San Francisco as well it's not just a matter of not letting them do
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:44.820]   their job we actually have a massive shortage the city needs to hire a lot more they allowed a pretty
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.360]   great rate of attrition in the role I don't think there's a lot of people who want to be cops in San
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.580]   Francisco it's a pretty tough job and they'll get a lot of support so yeah we actually have a shortage
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:59.340]   here and that's a big problem yeah but it's very solvable as you say I mean just hire more train
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:05.280]   them let them do their jobs Jared how much do you think um federal deficits and the federal
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.240]   debt matters going into this election cycle is it going to be a top topic or is it not really
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.760]   going to matter and then more importantly how consequential is it in reality I think in reality
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.860]   it's it's massively consequential um I think in the election cycle I think both parties are going to
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:24.000]   probably try to avoid talking about it because I think that you know everyone knows you know what
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.080]   I find in politics is when some things are really big issue people try not to talk about it that
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.900]   much and um but the hope is they're going to have to get cut right the hope is is that you know um
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.580]   once you get through the election things can be done to to to have to deal with it but it's
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:44.700]   definitely an issue that needs to be dealt with what do you think that is raising revenue or cutting
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:52.140]   expenses or both growth growth is the answer everyone that's that's the political cop-out
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:57.780]   answers growth six percent economic GDP growth how about we free spending until until the denominator
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:02.700]   can grow big enough to reduce the I mean balance budget Amendment Etc but but speaking of GDP
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:07.260]   growth I mean do you guys want to cover tech stories and AI this week real quick before we
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:13.680]   mean it's really incredible can I just uh I got I can't resist getting Jared on the record about uh
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.640]   the Russia Ukraine war
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:20.520]   oh so I mean this is a war that I thought was very easily avoidable you have a one minute budget one
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.080]   minute budget that's all I need I'm starting the shot clock Chamath is gonna ring the gavel I'm
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:31.020]   gonna take a break go you got 60 seconds I think uh I think David's happy to have somebody on uh
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:35.880]   who agrees with him on on most of what he's been saying uh so yeah we we worked with uh
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.200]   with Ukraine and we worked well with Russia uh during our four years uh I I'd like to point
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.580]   out of people that uh when we were in kind of our worst moments in covid the the second
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:48.360]   country that sent us a plane load of supplies and ventilators when New York looked like it was
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.680]   you know on the verge of going under was Russia and that was because we were offering them the
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.880]   possibility of of working together we armed Ukraine but we also told Ukraine you know don't
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:02.640]   even think about raising NATO uh as a membership as a way to go I think what happened was is the
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.740]   Biden administration uh you know had conversations with Ukraine about joining NATO Russia basically
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:11.100]   pushed their their military to the front line to say we are never going to let this happen
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.520]   if you go through uh kind of the geography and the history you understand why it's going to happen
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.900]   why um you know Russia you know will never let that occur and I think it was right after you
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.500]   know the embarrassment of what happened with our withdrawal in Afghanistan where they thought that
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:27.900]   we had a weak America that was going to come and do much to it so I think it was all very very
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.620]   avoidable I think that you know from what I read and again I wasn't involved in these conversations
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:36.060]   it did feel like there were some off-ramps uh initially but I do think that from our
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:39.960]   perspective I think the number one interest has always been how do we avoid a nuclear war I don't
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.620]   think that that's uh that's something we want to see happen and I do think that
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:49.860]   um I do think that hopefully they'll be able to find some kind of resolution to uh to not have
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:53.040]   that be a problem and I will say too that that's impacting the Middle East I mean right now what's
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:59.040]   happening with uh with Israel and with uh with the Palestinians and Iran is basically a proxy war for
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.760]   Russia I mean if America decided tomorrow let's change and support the Palestinians that Russia
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.440]   would come and be for Israel I mean there's not a lot of ideology for them in that but I think Russia
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.300]   and China want to see the U.S stretched and distracted so that we're less focused on kind
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.400]   of the areas where we're more directly uh uh you know you know you know you know you know you know
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.620]   uh in um in in conflict with them and so I think that that's a very major thing and I will say too
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:24.780]   like I I think that you know I I don't believe that the countries have permanent allies or
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:28.080]   permanent enemies you know I during my time in government we deal with the Germans and the
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:32.640]   Japanese who were vicious in World War II and we'd be against the Chinese and we'd be against the
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.460]   Russians who were basically our allies in World War II and so um I don't think countries really have
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:43.500]   friends I think countries have interests and I think that with with most countries you have areas
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.300]   of interest and I think that you can find those even with countries where you're in opposition for
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:53.160]   so you know one of the the operating principles I I brought to all the different foreign policy
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:59.100]   problem sets I was given was don't condemn tomorrow to be like yesterday uh because you
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.720]   think it has to be and so I would always look at something I try to pull whatever optimism I could
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:09.000]   find and then say you know what's the best case scenario from a first principles perspective I'd
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.260]   start there and then I'd work through all the problems uh that you had to try to get there so
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.280]   um so so
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:19.380]   um so David I think you've been uh way more right on Ukraine than than others and uh and I do think
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:24.000]   there's been a tremendous amount that's been mismanaged by uh by the US and and by the world
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.960]   in that in that scenario and I think it's unfortunate too because I think a lot of people
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.760]   have been killed in that war and I I do think that obviously the invasion of Ukraine was was a
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:38.460]   terrible thing it should never have happened but I do think there's a lot of um acts by leaders that
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:43.560]   could have been done in order to either prevent it or or minimize it and and I still think that that's
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:48.300]   one of the leaders in the world is to try to do the hard things and try to do the things to to make
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:53.760]   the world a less volatile and dangerous place you think it's coming to an end it's definitely lost
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:59.880]   its prominence it does seem militarily um again I'm sitting here in Miami you know reading you
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:05.040]   know you know X and newspapers and talking to folks so I'm not going to opine like I'm a general
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:11.040]   on the front lines but um but it does seem like it's kind of reached the point where it's not much
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.160]   is going to change militarily and uh and and and uh I think that's that's what I think is the most important thing
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:17.820]   um you know again like every day that goes on there's just more life that's being lost and again
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:22.020]   I said the same thing with Israel that I'd say here I mean Russia and Ukraine both have you know
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:25.680]   unbelievably brilliant people if you take all these these young men and you take them off the
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.180]   battle lines and put it back into you know their jobs of of creating things I just think that that
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:35.100]   that's just a much better thing for the world so uh my hope is that you know the leaders involved
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:39.840]   try to find a way to get to a resolution uh again you know I think that you know both sides have
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:44.100]   maybe over promised their people what what Victory looks like but that's the job of negotiation right
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:48.480]   you need to you know you need to find an off-ramp for everyone and get them to a place where we can
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.920]   you know start focusing on how to make tomorrow better instead of litigating grievances from the
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:57.960]   past do you guys see that Sunny Sunny tweeted this thing he had dinner last night with Farhan
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:04.440]   Thawar who is the VP of engineering at Shopify did you see his tweet yeah can you find it he said that
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:12.360]   Shopify has written more than a million lines of code with copilot already oh wow I was like what
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.040]   yeah
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:21.600]   I mean I don't exactly know how much there's your GDP growth Jared well that's definitely
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:29.460]   growth I wonder whether it'll be it'll be GD I mean I think it will I think a lot of product
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:35.100]   productivity gains are going to drive the economy forward historically I was just talking with
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:41.100]   someone this past week about over the last couple of decades we've seen a massive shift on GDP growth
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:47.460]   being driven largely by labor the labor force growing and labor participation and increasingly
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:52.200]   in the last couple of years there's been this tremendous shift that all GDP growth is predominantly
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:57.840]   driven by productivity gains and productivity gains you know economically net their way through
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.780]   the uh the system and you see the the total GDP grow this is the whole argument for AI particularly
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:07.440]   at a moment like this that if you're having a declining population you're having declining labor
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.260]   participation people want to work fewer hours
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:15.240]   if you want to keep growing the economy in order to sustain the debt and the services that you provide
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.280]   through a government infrastructure you have to grow the economy and you have to increase
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:24.720]   productivity it's the only way forward it's I mean like you could have one it's not like you're
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.480]   going to fire Engineers you're just going to have one engineer do five times as much
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:35.100]   Dave you just solved the whole budget deficit and debt issue you found the answer it's productivity
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:39.420]   driven by by the AI Advancements which by the way there is a lot of tremendous productivity gains
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:44.160]   that will occur because of this I always give people the example of the tractor like when the
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.780]   tractor came around it's not like you know people were like hey we're going to make less food now or
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:54.240]   you know what happened was we were able to farm 10 times as much and you know total output increased
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.100]   and when total output increased there was an abundance of surplus of food of calories that
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:03.720]   fed people population grew the overall economy grew there's no point in history
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.300]   that we've had a productivity gain through technology that didn't ultimately grow the
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:17.040]   economy like it's never well ever gone the other way in 1900 I think about 50 of workers in America
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:23.340]   were somehow involved in agriculture yeah by more than that yeah by 2000 it was down to like two
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:27.720]   percent one so it's not like we had a 40 unemployment rate all these other figures
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:33.000]   figure it out a way to do new and productive things and that led to more wealth that being
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.220]   said it did cause a lot of social disruption and I think certain job classes went away it had to get
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:42.120]   replaced by others that had to be invented if you think about a world where there's a million
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.440]   little companies or 50 million companies or 500 million companies that exist because there are
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.720]   one and two person teams that can build stuff that seems pretty reasonable and logical as the outcome
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.260]   there's a lot of sort of like
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:02.280]   financial engineering
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:07.860]   that kind of goes away in that world right I think the job of the Venture capitalist change is really
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.100]   profound
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:14.940]   I think there's a reasonable case to make that it doesn't exist it's more of an automated system of
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:21.600]   capital against objectives right and that you want to be making many many many small hundred
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.460]   thousand five hundred thousand dollar bets and then you get to this much larger scale where then
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:32.280]   you once you get someplace you can go and get the 100 and 200 million dollar checks I don't I don't
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:37.680]   know how else all of this gets supported financially well so there were a couple big news stories this
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:37.980]   week
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:47.820]   one was Elon launched grok which is a chat GPT call it competitor it took them about under his
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:54.360]   xai business unit took him about eight months to train grok one which is the model and by many
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:37:01.020]   measures is as performative as GPT three and a half GPT four at the same no no rock zero it took
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:04.920]   three months to train grok zero he's still training grok one sorry three months to train grok zero
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.860]   yeah kaifu Lee you guys know
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:15.060]   kaifu yeah he was at Google he was at Microsoft yeah and he is um in China and built
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:25.260]   uh his business starting eight months ago and in those eight months uh he's now delivered a
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:30.960]   34 billion parameter model that he's completely open source that he shows by again some
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:37.740]   performative metrics outperformed llama too and again doing it from China speaks
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:41.760]   I think really clearly and importantly to the point we talked about last week about
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.400]   if the U.S tries to overregulate AI model development there are alternatives out there
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:52.560]   particularly open source alternatives that will continue to proliferate and improve and again this
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:59.400]   was done in eight months and then it's almost like the timing was perfect because in the same week
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.500]   open AI responds with developer day they didn't necessarily respond but they had developer day
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.620]   on the books for a long time and at developer day open
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:13.080]   AI released a number of really powerful tools for developers that allow them to build really
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:19.680]   powerful applications and infrastructure on top of open AI's platform so they released
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:27.300]   APIs for dolly 3. a four cents to generate an image using the dolly 3 API they launched a tool
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:33.540]   to create your own GPT which can actually leverage proprietary data so from within your own database
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:37.500]   you're in your your own data Lake you can build a GPT
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:45.600]   that you can then integrate into applications and GPT-4 Turbo with two versions that had you
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:49.980]   know pretty powerful pricing improvements all of this um being said it's a it's a big
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:54.840]   leap forward in what feels like a low-cost low friction multimodal developer-friendly
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:00.840]   set of tools from open AI that allows them to move away from having the quote best model
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:07.380]   to now having what feels like much more of a platform business that has more applications and
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:14.940]   more developers start to utilize open AI's toolkit and services a real ecosystem starts to develop
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.680]   and that creates a sustainable business mode rather than just the technical mode that open
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.680]   AI started with so I think the big point is that we're seeing the technical Gap narrow
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.780]   between the best and the average or the worst in the median in model development
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:36.960]   we're also now seeing that the evolution for a lot of these businesses is through open AI trying to
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:42.540]   you know applications on top of a platform and build a business mode and so there's a real shift
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:46.980]   underway but net net I think what the market's forcing everyone to do is really compete and build
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.820]   these incredible capabilities that are really going to launch a number of new business models
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:56.280]   new innovations I think the question is are we building apps for the iOS app store are we building
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:02.160]   web pages for the open internet and I think open AI's hope is that it's apps for the app
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.140]   store because it's proprietary and they own it they could take a share I think the reality is it's going to end
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:15.300]   up as the open web and again I think it's mostly because everybody else just can't afford to let one
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:21.060]   company run away with it and so you know whether it's llama or Mistral or even grok when Elon open
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:28.320]   source is it it's going to allow people to have access to these tools basically for free
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:35.700]   the problem that I think it creates is you know we had a you know when I first came to the United
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.020]   States my the
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:42.840]   the company that I worked at AOL they were the ones that believed in a fundamentally closed
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:48.900]   internet right and you had this service and you went into the walled Garden of AOL and then the
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:53.880]   pendulum swung over the last 20 years and we opened it up at Facebook and at other places and now we
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.500]   have this fundamentally open architecture the problem now is these models will not get better
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:04.440]   unless you have fine tuning that happens by yourself or these reinforcement learning loops
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.900]   that come from data that you control
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:13.080]   and you can see it with grog zero part of what makes grok really successful is that
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:20.760]   Elon and only Elon can give access to the x fire hose to grok now that's a ginormous
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.560]   repository of proprietary data that they're going to be able to train on so then the question is
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:30.180]   well obviously then Facebook will want to train their models on Instagram and their models on
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:36.780]   WhatsApp Google will want to train Gemini on Gmail none of those companies will want to make that
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:44.160]   available to any other model and so the unfortunate byproduct of a more of foundational
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.600]   models that are more pervasive is going to be that the internet gets a little bit more closed
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.920]   in the short term and we're going to have to really figure out what the implications of that
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:58.800]   are so I think what that means economically is there's just going to be a lot more small
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:05.160]   companies and a lot fewer of these ginormous outcomes and that's on balance probably better for
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.660]   you know innovation
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:12.720]   in the economy probably yeah data is the advantage not the model itself you have to you have to own
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.360]   some data asset that is unique so that you can train these models and then you have to close
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.620]   it off so nobody else can have access to it and that has to be an explicit business decision
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:29.280]   because it would be foolish for you to not do that did you take anything away from this week's
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.200]   announcements with kaifu Elon and openai's developer day grok is interesting as an AI
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.580]   because it has a sense of humor
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:40.560]   um that's what's kind of interesting about the user experience is it tries to be funny it has
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.080]   a sense of irony it's also willing to be more politically incorrect and I think one of the
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:51.660]   concerns about chat GPT early on was that it was programmed to be woke and that it wasn't giving
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:56.940]   people you know truthful answers about a lot of things that the censorship was being built in to
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.260]   the to the answers and there was a lot of examples very early on where it seemed like there was some
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:06.420]   sort of trust and safety layer that had been built on top of the AI and sometimes it would intervene
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:11.580]   and not give you the true answer that came from the AI would give you kind of some made up boiler
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:19.140]   plate and so having something like rock around will at a minimum keep open AI honest and keep
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:24.540]   you know keep chat GPT honest because if it's willing to give you truthful answers about things
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:29.580]   that you compare to the chat GPT answer then we're going to know when these like so-called trust and
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:35.160]   safety interventions are are happening so I think that's kind of interesting separately
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:42.120]   the open AI developer day shows that that company if you want to call it that I don't know if it's a
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:49.680]   company or Foundation or what but it's a complicated legal entity uh I mean those are details yeah
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:56.640]   those are details um I mean they are really um trucking along at full speed I mean it is pretty
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:04.560]   impressive what they're shipping yeah and even if the underlying language models get somewhat
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:10.920]   seem like they're building a very robust developer ecosystem so you could analogize
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:16.020]   it to something like stripe where credit card payments are pretty much a commodity but everyone
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:21.300]   uses a stripe because their dev tools are so good and then they're able to get to a bunch of scale
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:26.280]   network effects because again their developer platform is so good so I do think that that's
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:31.080]   the advantage of open AI may not be the model itself although I think I think their model is
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:36.060]   actually pretty good but it's is it that much better than llama 2 probably not but the developer platform
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:40.620]   is getting really good by the way that's a really interesting analogy because if you play that out
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:47.400]   and you say is AI like payments well what does the payments landscape look like in terms of companies
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:53.220]   that have real Enterprise value there are I guess three or four big ones and then there's a bunch of
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:58.800]   long tail ones in specific geographies because there are these random rules in a country and you
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:05.280]   build something to be very specific to it and you have value in that market or in that use case and
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:10.020]   uh maybe there's an analogy there and how this market develops in that sense there's four or five
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:13.800]   big foundational models and then there's a bunch of small vertical use applications that you use
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.940]   depending on what the task is well the time and the cost to build new foundational model seems to
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:24.480]   be shrinking had a pretty fast clip so and by the way all of this happened on H100s yeah
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:31.080]   and a bunch of these happened on a100 so we're still one generation of silicon behind so to your
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.400]   point this thing is going to be like people will be training models in weeks yeah so let's go ahead
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:41.520]   and track all the world's models and have a federal regulatory body overseeing all of this
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:47.580]   well I'm I have a guy from the UK on an H1B so I'm still filling out the TPS report because he
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:55.980]   I told him don't touch the model and he did yeah yeah definitely following high level from my
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:59.820]   perspective I I think it's it's great especially with what you mentioned about kaifuli it just
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.000]   confirms what we've thought what we've thought which is that America is definitely leading in
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.700]   this and I think that it's just important to to note
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:08.580]   that they're leading be really because of the private sector and the fact that the private
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:12.720]   sector has been allowed to do what they do and as we start to think about the regulatory frameworks
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:17.520]   I mean you could think of a open AI as a as a company or a foundation or even as a nation state
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.960]   with with kind of the amount of power that these things will have the ability to to harness once
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:26.400]   they're they're fully scaled and I I just think it's it's it's going to be very interesting to
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.080]   see I think the more uh competitive competition you have here I think the better uh it will be
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.580]   very very good but I do think you want the most powerful um models the
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:40.380]   most powerful platforms to be in the hands of people who are going to try to apply it for all
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:44.880]   the right uh all the right things for society so I think that there's a lot of positive applications
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.660]   there's a lot of negative applications that can come from this and my hope is that the
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:53.640]   regulatory frameworks that are developed won't stifle Innovation at the expense of allowing
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.140]   others to get ahead of us who will probably use them in in ways that we would not want to see
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:02.280]   them used right can I fly a couple of features that open AI announced that I think are interesting
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.460]   yeah yeah as long as you don't repeat what I said because you weren't paying attention
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:09.780]   but yeah no go for it well did you mention the well if I got this wrong with delete it but did
[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:16.440]   you mention the 128k context window no I did not I did not no good job it's kind of a big deal
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:23.280]   what that means is you can have a prompt that has 300 pages of text in it yes I'll tell you
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:27.360]   like several months ago I was trying to figure out like is there a way where I could just put
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:35.340]   all of my blog posts in a prompt for chat GPT and have it turn into a book for example and I
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:39.060]   was kind of like a problem I just started working on it was actually very complicated to try and
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:44.880]   solve that yeah also like also vector DBs were a totally useless intermediate like that abstraction
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:48.720]   didn't need to exist that's all gone now too they're doing those guys are firing on all
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.640]   cylinders it's really it's really impressive to see yeah the other thing is multimodal I
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.800]   mean so they're really stressing the idea of combining text with
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:05.220]   photos I guess videos will eventually come later um text-to-speech but again having
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:11.340]   multiple kinds of inputs and outputs for the AI I think yeah and proprietary where you can plug in
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:16.080]   your own proprietary data sources I mean it's just a game changer for a lot of Enterprise customers I
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.040]   think those developers are going to go nuts I heard a lot of positive feedback from developer
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.480]   folks I know who attended and sounds like it was very positively received
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.520]   okay well this has been great Jared thank you so much for joining us today it was really great
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.360]   to spend time together this is the point in the show where you tell David Sachs that you love him
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.560]   and uh
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:41.700]   he says right back at you guys I want to say sticking 153 episodes but finally there's a
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:46.440]   person that I can say I'm now the second best looking guy on this pod so Jared thank you for
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:52.980]   coming on oh you guys are the best I'm gonna come back more often than if you'll have me I
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:59.760]   get treated better here than I do in my home so it's good so so do we that's yeah yeah together
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.020]   but thank you guys for having me on and and really thank you for all the different um you know
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:07.980]   important conversations you have and again I've met a lot of people who listen to you guys over
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.600]   the time and uh they all find that you guys give them a lot of good input into a lot of the issues
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.100]   that are impacting our daily lives so thank you for the opportunity to be with you thanks man thanks
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:21.960]   for being here thanks for being here thank you very much we'll let your winners ride
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.960]   brain man David Sachs
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:32.520]   and it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it love you guys
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.900]   I'm queen of kinwah
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:55.260]   we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless it's
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:50:02.760]   like this like sexual tension but we just need to release that now what you're about B what your B
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.580]   we need to get merch
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.620]   I'm doing all in
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:15.660]   I'm doing all in
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.720]   you
