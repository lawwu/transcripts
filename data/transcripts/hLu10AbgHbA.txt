[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Let's learn how to get started with W and B using HuggingFace in less than a minute.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.360]   I'm Chris Van Pelt, co-founder of Weights & Biases.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.920]   First, let's install and import our Python client, WANDB.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.120]   With a few environment variables, we're able to set up our awesome experiment with automatic
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   metric tracking and model logging. After that, let's load our favorite HuggingFace model to fine
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.720]   tune. Hmm, I'm feeling sequence classification today. With only one line of code, we can begin
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.440]   tracking this fun experiment. It's as easy as setting report2 equals WANDB. And lastly,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.200]   calling trainer.train to start the training. That's it. Seriously.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.920]   Now you can see metrics and parameters flowing into your project dashboard,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.240]   model predictions visualized in interactive tables, and your final model checkpoint,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.440]   which was automatically logged. Happy experimenting!
