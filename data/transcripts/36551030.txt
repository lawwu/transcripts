[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.360]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend some time today with you as we learn
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.280]   together and just really explore the delights and challenges that make homeschooling the
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.840]   adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.480]   Now, whether you are just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the daily delight
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.820]   of family learning, I think you're going to enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.120]   But don't forget, although our online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.280]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.440]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.120]   Well, listeners, I'm so excited to welcome you to this episode of Everyday Educator.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.660]   I've got Delise with us, as usual.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.120]   Delise is here, and we have a dear friend, Olivia Walsh, with us, too.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.080]   And we're going to talk about homeschooling, as always, but we're going to talk about it
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.180]   in a way that the three of us were just discussing.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.200]   We've never really thought about homeschooling as producing a legacy before.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.320]   So we're going to talk about building a legacy with our homeschooling.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.280]   And what does that mean?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.680]   And what does that look like?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.620]   Olivia, thank you for joining me and Delise today.
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.700]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.720]   You said that you had never really thought about homeschooling and legacy kind of in the same
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.300]   sentence.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.220]   What do you usually think about when you think about legacies?
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.980]   Sure.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.940]   So I guess I just don't think about legacies a whole lot.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.480]   But I do think of it, truly, but I do think of it mostly in the sense of passing down a
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.020]   value, an idea.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.640]   But then I kind of also think about it as passing down something, but maybe not all things.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.820]   So I, being a homeschool nerd, I literally went to my Webster dictionary before I came on
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.140]   the call.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.960]   Yeah, I have to.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:27.340]   And legacy, in my 1984 copy dictionary, says money, that legacy is money or property bequeathed
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.780]   by a will, or that it's something handed down from an ancestor or from the past, like a strong
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.140]   legacy of personal freedom.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.540]   So I was thinking of like, you know, when you have this legacy of maybe your dad was a lawyer
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.980]   and you're a lawyer, or you have some gift that you give to your community.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.640]   You know, maybe you are some good benefactor, you know, like a family legacy.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.620]   But I don't always think of literal things as being passed down on their own.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.540]   Like, for example, I have a painting, a beautiful painting of my father-in-law from when he was
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.240]   a kid, and it's hanging in our living room because I loved it because, you know, it makes
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.280]   me think of Doug, and I love who Doug is.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.300]   But I wouldn't necessarily think of that painting as holding any much value to it, unless I told
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.940]   my kids, this is your grandfather, and these are the things he stood for.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.560]   Yeah, the story that goes with the thing.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.060]   Be like, if I had, one thing for me in particular, when I had to sit and think through some of the
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.440]   questions you sent over with legacy was it made me think about my maternal grandparents' legacy
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.520]   when it comes to how I stay connected with them through gardening.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.220]   Like, I have my grandfather's blackberry vines in my yard, and several of my cousins do, and
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.180]   my aunts do, and my parents do, and Iris is in honor of my grandmother.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.920]   But just, I don't want to, like, ramble, ramble the whole time, but I did want to say one other
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.820]   thing was that it made me think about how small my perspective on legacy really is, because I
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.160]   only think back one or two generations, maybe three.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.680]   I don't think of something that has lasted for generations, like, with a society or culture
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.760]   that has a tradition that's passed down that says, hey, this is a piece of our identity.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.600]   Yes.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.800]   So it was a really interesting question that you posed.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.820]   I love what you just said.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.460]   It has something to do with our identity.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.800]   Because a lot of times, I know, for me, legacies tend to be something that you inherit, something
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.020]   that was passed down.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:48.720]   I know that I have a stone from my great-grandmother's ring that my dad gave me after his grandmother
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.700]   passed away.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.820]   I was the daughter who had the most relationship with that great-grandmother, and so I have that.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.420]   And, you know, we have some similar stories.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.720]   I have a, my husband and I have a plant that came from a cutting that was his grandmother's,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.360]   and our girls have cuttings from that plant.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.340]   And so I guess that's kind of a legacy.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.420]   But I love the whole idea of a legacy being part of your family identity,
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.560]   or you inheriting a legacy that speaks into your identity.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.140]   Delise, do you have anything like that?
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.580]   Do you have any legacies that are identity-making?
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.180]   I do.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.680]   And I think I love having this conversation with people because I'm starting to realize that
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.960]   what I have is maybe more unique than I thought.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.220]   Because I think it's the idea of legacy all the time.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.700]   I mean, like multiple times in a week, usually every day.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.960]   And I realize now that I think about it because it's been planted in me.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.760]   So it very much is a legacy that I'm carrying on.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.720]   And thinking about legacies.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.740]   Yeah, truly.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.960]   And not just me, but also my husband.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.840]   Like, I know my husband's family history and the things that we're retaining in his family
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.420]   history for our sons.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.700]   But I also know the things that, when you talk about culture, Olivia, like I know the
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.740]   things that six generations back, like I know my whole family line.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.800]   I know the things that generations back, they tried to preserve that I'm still trying to
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.380]   steward and pass to my son.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.900]   And even down to very specific things, like my family has a legacy of hosting and hospitality.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.600]   And my family has, the women have a legacy of sewing.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.580]   And so like, there are all kinds of really fun stories about my grandmother and my great
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.020]   grandmother and the things that they made for different people that they sewed for them.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.000]   And I mean, I could go on and on about this, but I do find it so fascinating.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.400]   And I think it has the potential to really shape and inspire your children as a child who was
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.300]   fed a very specific type of legacy in the way that they view themselves in the scope of the
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.620]   world.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.180]   So, yeah, I love this topic.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.620]   That's really cool.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.420]   And you know what?
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.740]   I was having a conversation with my daughters who are grown, who one is getting ready to have
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.460]   her first baby and one has two little ones already.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:33.200]   And we were talking about things in our home that we have received as physical legacies.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.760]   And I was explaining to them that there are going to be some things that it would be important
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.800]   to me for them to keep.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.040]   And, you know, I mean, they are not really attached to some of the things, the things
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.260]   that I am attached to.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.500]   But I stumbled across something really interesting.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.340]   I said, well, let me tell you why this thing is important to me.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:05.680]   And I told my daughter this whole story about why this piece of furniture had been important
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.640]   to her grandfather and why it was important.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.980]   What little child memories I had and what growing up memories I had.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.340]   And she was really quiet when I got done.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.780]   And she said, Mama, that makes me want to keep it.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.460]   The object I don't really care about.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:33.480]   The story that connected that object to me as your child and as Pawpaw's granddaughter and
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.520]   as the great-granddaughter, great-great-granddaughter of a woman I never knew, she said, it's the
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.100]   story that connects me.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.020]   Because she said, now I can identify with that piece.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.280]   And so something you said, Delise, brought that to my mind.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:58.900]   Because you said you love to hear the stories of how these legacies of hospitality or sewing
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.220]   have established a family identity to you.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:11.940]   And so I think it's all about the stories that we tell our children that show them how those
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.320]   things are intrinsic to who our family has become.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.520]   And maybe that's the benefit of the legacy.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.260]   What do y'all think?
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.320]   Olivia, what do you think is the benefit of a legacy?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.540]   Well, I think it benefits you even when you don't necessarily know it.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.420]   Like you said, your daughters are young and you want to give them things.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.800]   I've been in that position as the daughter multiple times.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.820]   And I can tell you, I don't like stuff being brought to my house.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.940]   Right, that's how they are.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.260]   It's just the truth.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.940]   I hate to say it, but it's true.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.740]   I don't like it.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:54.500]   But when you give me understanding as to why this is actually a richness, you know, this is a good
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.220]   thing for you to pass down.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:02.820]   I mean, even when you don't understand it, you take it on as you age and your kids grow up.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.400]   The value is just instilled even more and the understanding grows.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:15.440]   So I was thinking about that it can be beneficial if I see it not just like the burden side of it,
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.720]   like literally taking something on.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.120]   Like, okay, now I have to, whatever.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.040]   Now I have to sew.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.100]   Maybe you don't like sewing.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.040]   Now I have to sew.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.760]   Well, you don't see it as a burden.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.340]   You see it as it's a calling now.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.640]   Right?
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.880]   So now it's a way that you are.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.600]   It's now something that you're picking up, like the idea of passing on the baton or the torch.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.040]   It's now a calling on my life because what does this do for other people?
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.840]   How can I help other people with this?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   How can I love others?
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.880]   How can I teach my children through this?
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:51.700]   Because I think something that's really special about classical education is that we say it is God-centered,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.560]   and all these subjects are really just your whole world, right?
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.840]   And you see Christ in the midst of it because he's there with you in the midst of it.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:06.280]   And so no matter what it is that we are called to do, we do it for the glory of the Lord, right?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   And it's another area that we can now teach our children strength in their faith.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:19.240]   So I think that it's beneficial to you on a much deeper level than you can comprehend as an 8-year-old kid or a 15-year-old,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.600]   or even now at 30, I miss things, you know?
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.760]   So I think it has great value beyond what we can see.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.220]   Oh, that's lovely.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.160]   Which I want to hear more from Delisa.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.940]   I know.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.060]   I want to say what Delisa thinks.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.240]   Does your mom actually be like, this is who we are?
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   Because, like, that's kind of what I wonder.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.840]   Like, did you have family members that were like, hey, don't just come sew with me,
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.240]   but, like, let me tell you about us?
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.980]   Yes.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.460]   I can hear your mom.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.140]   I can hear your mom's voice, Delisa, saying things like that.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.540]   And even now, like, my grandmother.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:02.300]   So I have a really strong line of matriarchs in my family.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.980]   So, like, I know the stories of my grandmother, my great-grandmother, of course, my mother,
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.480]   and et cetera.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.020]   And so people are still telling me really beautiful stories about sewing.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.500]   Like, for example, my grandmother has always been really generous.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.760]   That's another one of her legacies.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.000]   And I will get to the benefit of it, but we'll use it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.000]   I want to, yeah.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.280]   A little story.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.120]   And so when she met her little brother's girlfriend for the first time,
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.660]   they were going to go out dancing.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.180]   That's something my family does.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:34.800]   We dance.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.960]   I always call it partying.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   And then I think that people think that we're drinking and moving crazy.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.920]   We're not doing that.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.860]   We're eating good food.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.220]   We're staying up late, playing cards and loving each other.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.900]   But, you know, we're having a great time.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.120]   And so they were going to do what they always do, which was go dancing.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.140]   And my now Aunt Jean didn't have a dress.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.240]   She had nothing to wear.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.300]   And so they were like, oh, no, what are we going to do?
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.580]   Because, you know, this is, I think it was the 50s at that point.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.620]   So you have to have a dress.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.260]   You have to be dressed up.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.580]   Can't go out without a dress.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.900]   So my grandmother, knowing that they were planning to go out the next day,
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.000]   spent the whole night making her a dress from scratch.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.680]   And when Jean woke up the next morning, she had this dancing dress to go out in.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.800]   And she just couldn't believe, you know, like the generosity of my grandmother's heart
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.440]   and the way that she had used the skill that she had.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:33.300]   But what it does for me and the benefit of knowing some of these different legacies on
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.500]   a regular basis is it causes me to want to live up, if that makes sense.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.620]   Because I know about the courage and the strength that the people who raised me and raised the
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.400]   people who raised me apply to their lives in these really practical ways, I consider it
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.480]   when I'm making a decision.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.420]   Even if it's just that I know that Hattie Duren, who was my great-grandmother, would
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.620]   never have left the house in X way, you know, like I just think about it because I know that
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.380]   I'm carrying them and we have very strong genes too.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.320]   So depending on where I am in the United States, if I show up in a town, people know that I'm
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.300]   related to these people because I look like them.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.440]   So I think about it a lot.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:23.320]   And yeah, it's been empowering to me too, especially, you know, being a parent is difficult.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.200]   And so sometimes we have challenging moments.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:34.340]   And I think about the legacy of the women who have been leaders in my family over the years
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.280]   and the fact that the Lord did those things through them and that he can do it through
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.040]   me as well.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.720]   Um, when I'm raising my son and, you know, facing something that I've never faced before,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.960]   but I know they've faced this.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.180]   Yes.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.620]   And so you are, you, I like what you said.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.300]   It, it, it causes you, it calls you to live up.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.600]   Um, it is an encouragement.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:07.200]   If we have received a legacy of hospitality or a legacy of perseverance or a legacy of leadership
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.720]   or a legacy of strength or, and I promise guys, we're going to get to it, a legacy of homeschooling,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.940]   a legacy of valuing education.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.220]   It helps you to live up in those moments that would drag you down.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.260]   That would, you just say, yeah, I'm out.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.840]   I mean, I'm tapping out here.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.760]   I can't.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.080]   I mean, this is not, this is clearly not meant for me, or this is no longer working for us.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.100]   You lean into, you lean into, and you live up to that legacy.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.320]   Um, and it can be a beautiful thing.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:51.180]   Now, for me, I don't have a look back legacy of homeschooling.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:57.260]   Um, when, I don't think, well, I mean, I'm a good bit older than you guys.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:03.240]   And so when I was little, um, I don't know that homeschooling was a thing.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:03.700]   Okay.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.740]   I mean, you know, it was a thing on the prairie, but like I tell my kids, I'm not that old.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.080]   Okay.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.660]   But it was not a thing.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:16.320]   I went to public school and my, and my parents never considered, and nobody I knew ever considered
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.040]   anything, but going to school.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   So I don't have a legacy of home education, but my children do.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:34.620]   And I know that when we began homeschooling, um, I was very, my husband and I were very intentional
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:44.980]   about establishing what we hoped would be a legacy of a family culture of learning.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.660]   We hoped, especially after the first couple of years, when we thought this is the best
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:54.480]   thing we have ever done in between those moments when we thought this is the hardest thing God
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.640]   has ever asked me to do.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.800]   And we thought this is the best thing.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:06.980]   And, and I hope my children will choose this path, but I know that both of you guys were homeschooled.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:15.540]   Um, and so I want to know, um, why did your parents choose to homeschool you?
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:24.780]   And did you know what their reason was at the time that you were being homeschooled?
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.300]   And did you agree with it?
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.340]   Did you want to be homeschooled?
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.880]   Olivia, I'll ask you first.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.340]   Um, do you know why your parents picked homeschooling and did you agree with their reason?
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.320]   Did you like it?
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.720]   Um, I, I liked being homeschooled there.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.780]   I, I was homeschooled K through 12.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.140]   So it's not like there was like much option.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.960]   A come home day.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.020]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:52.200]   But, um, I know that the reason we were homeschooled really came down more to my mom than my dad.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.040]   My mom had been interested in homeschool for a very long time.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.480]   Um, I'm from a mixed home, a mixed family.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.260]   So she had been married and had her oldest and my dad had been married and had his oldest.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.040]   And then they met and grew the family with me and my, one of my sisters.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:14.880]   Um, but she had been interested in home education since my brother who is 16 years older than I am.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.480]   Wow.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.000]   In elementary school.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.480]   Okay.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:23.320]   But, um, it just wasn't something she could do very well at the time.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.240]   She was a single mom, but I know it had always been at the back of her mind.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.960]   Um, and I think it had a lot to do with the way she wanted the culture around her, her kids.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.240]   I think she just wanted them to be around the right people and have truth spoken to them.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.560]   Like I can, I was thinking back to my mom and I think a big thing for my mom was always just truth.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.740]   You know, she wanted to pursue the truth.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.720]   I don't know if she necessarily knew exactly what that looked like when she set out and
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.420]   what the outcomes of that were going to be.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:59.420]   But I know that that was a big motivator for her was that she wanted us to learn the truth
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.040]   and she wanted us not just like facts, right?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:08.080]   Not just about where the world came from, but also about the people who were big influences
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.960]   in our lives.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.520]   She wanted them to speak the truth to us.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.400]   And when you're in, let's say a public school setting, you don't have control over who's
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.940]   in there with your kids all the time.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.300]   You don't have control over what the peers in their life are saying.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:27.060]   And I think she saw a lot of, uh, honestly, like a negative impact on, on my brother from
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.180]   being around, um, not the truth all the time.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.300]   I mean, it did make a long-term impact on his life.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:40.100]   Um, but, uh, I, I know that that was important to her and I know that as she home educated
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.700]   us, it was, she didn't know how to put it into words.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.280]   That's actually why she started classically educating us.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.680]   Uh-huh.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.880]   Cause we did CC was she, she wanted to show, she wanted to teach us like everything is
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.380]   connected.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.600]   She didn't know how to do it.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.320]   She was like, I know that when we're talking about history, I know we're talking about math
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.380]   and I know we're talking about science and I know we're talking about scripture, but how
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.040]   do I teach you that?
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.740]   How do I package that?
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.160]   Right.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.440]   So, um, yeah.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:16.200]   And so, uh, I, I was happy to be homeschooled as far as like, was I considered, I had my oldest
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.980]   sister was in the public school all the way through graduation.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:24.400]   So we would go to, you know, plays and different activities at the public school.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.500]   And my mom taught art classes to afterschool students at the public schools at the middle
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.360]   and elementary schools in our town.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:38.600]   So I had spent every week time in the public schools and I didn't, it didn't interest me.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.840]   I didn't want to be there any more than I already was.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.780]   I liked being at home.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.480]   I liked my studies at home.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.660]   That's just me.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.760]   I don't, I don't know what it was like for Delise.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.580]   Cause Delise, you were homeschooled also.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.840]   Yep.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.420]   I was homeschooled all the way through.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.680]   And like you, Olivia, you know, not being the first child does kind of mean that you get
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.720]   grandfathered in, in the best way.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:09.860]   Um, so I was the third for, and then we always had a cousin who my mom was homeschooling.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.760]   Interestingly enough, I think she's about to graduate her sixth student from homeschool.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.540]   That's how, how many children do you have to graduate.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.200]   Now that's a legacy.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.800]   Yeah, that's a legacy.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.420]   And we have a legacy of education even before, like you said, it didn't used to be a thing
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.760]   that homeschooling was a normal choice.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.860]   And so my family, they were educators.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:36.760]   Um, but I know initially the choice to homeschool was because my oldest brother who was quite
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.040]   bright could read early on and the teacher would not allow him to read.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.120]   And my mother couldn't understand that.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.600]   And so she said, you know, I know, can you please just hand him a book because he knows
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.460]   his ABCs and I don't want him to lose his skills or, you know, just, I don't want him to be
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:52.900]   one.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.400]   Well, and you shouldn't want him to be disruptive because he's bored.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.240]   Exactly.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.800]   So give him something to do.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.580]   And the teacher just wouldn't.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.100]   And my mother couldn't understand it.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.820]   And so she, she pulled him out.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.920]   So that was one of the reasons.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:11.720]   And then another one of the reasons, just to be honest, was to, to depart from the statistics,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.940]   um, because I am an African-American.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.800]   And so growing up in the nineties in the South was a challenging time for academics.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.460]   You're right.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.560]   And my parents knew that, and they knew that they wanted to give my brothers and me the
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.660]   best chance that we possibly could get.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:35.040]   And so they realized very early on with that example that it might be wise for them to choose
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.140]   to homeschool us so that they could maintain our legacy.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.460]   You know, we have all kinds of things that my family's into classical music.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.440]   All kinds of stuff.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:48.320]   And so they wanted to, like what you were saying, Olivia, just make sure that the influences
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.740]   of my brother's lives and in my life were good influences and that we had more access to truth
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.680]   than anything else.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.300]   And homeschooling really did afford my family that.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.840]   And so I'm grateful for it.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.240]   And I had the choice, but I saw that, you know, my life would have looked really different
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.140]   if I chose to do public school.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.440]   I wanted to do all the extracurriculars and I wanted to work and I wanted to make my
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.720]   own schedule, you know, by the time I was graduating and homeschooling is the way to do it.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.800]   So I loved it.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.460]   Yes.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:27.240]   I love it that you both can look at your parents' choices and see that they were intentionally
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:36.700]   crafting an educational experience and not just educating your mind, but educating your heart.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:49.920]   And really impacting who you became and how you thought about things and what weight you
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.520]   gave to things.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:24:00.020]   Like truth was very important to you and choices and freedom and just recognizing that that choice
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:10.880]   that your parent made was perhaps the, either the beginning or the next step and a legacy that
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.400]   had been there for a while.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.600]   That's really cool.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:23.340]   So I know that both of you are set on home educating your own children.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.580]   Did you have to think twice about that?
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.020]   Was it just not really a decision?
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.120]   It was just, has it just become how you would obviously raise your children?
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.860]   Or did you and your husband, husbands have to think, are we going to do this homeschool thing
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.240]   or are we going to go another direction?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.920]   What do you think, Olivia?
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:51.940]   For Ian and I, Ian is my husband, for us, well, by the time our oldest started being ready for school,
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.520]   I was still working part-time and he works full-time.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.680]   And it wasn't, I don't want to like discourage anyone because that's not it at all.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.520]   Right.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.560]   Homeschool is very natural for me and homeschool is very natural for my husband.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.640]   There was never a question of, could we do it?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.120]   Or do we want to try it?
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.580]   It was just, that is the default in my brain.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.800]   That's the legacy.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.400]   That is the legacy.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.360]   It has just come down to you as natural.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:24.400]   So the question for us was more like, okay, well, would it benefit us if we sent him to
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.420]   this hybrid school?
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.740]   Do we want to look into this?
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:33.000]   And for us, it was like, no, like, you know, we could, but let's just do what we know to do
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.260]   best because it is very natural when you've been homeschooled because you just, you just,
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.760]   like, it never stops in my opinion.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:50.220]   Like, I feel like I'm constantly learning and I'm constantly seeing the world, you know,
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.900]   through education and, you know, not getting any credentials for anything I'm learning or
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.240]   studying or spending all this time on.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.580]   Right.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.980]   It's just the way we live.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.400]   Right.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.840]   And so my son is now just living life with me.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.580]   So, you know what I mean?
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.140]   Like, our kids are born and they just start living life with us and they start learning
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:08.560]   with us.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.980]   So, yeah, home school is never a question.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:19.340]   Do you think that's the legacy that your mom passed on to you that you just live, you
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:26.640]   just learn as part of the process of living and that a family culture of learning is just
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.060]   the same thing as a family culture?
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.100]   Do you think that's part of the legacy she passed to you?
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.660]   I think it's part of the legacy that they started to build without realizing it.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.420]   I don't think they, you know what I mean?
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.000]   I think, I think of it more that way.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.160]   So, like, it sounds like Delise has this, this true legacy that is being handed down
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.860]   and described.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:51.400]   And I'm sure I have stuff like that, but has it always been put into words exactly?
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.800]   I don't think so because my mom's still trying to figure it out.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.260]   My dad's figuring stuff out and then getting what I can to pass down.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.820]   But I think it is like, maybe my family does love truth.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:07.280]   I know they do, like my siblings and my parents, but has it, do I remember my mom saying, you
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.740]   know that she wanted us to learn the truth?
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.380]   Yes.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.240]   And did that stick?
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.640]   And so now do I say that to my kids?
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.380]   Maybe I should.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.380]   I'm learning from Delise.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.220]   Maybe I should.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.700]   But now it's like just an understanding.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.200]   No, in our education, we seek truth.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.040]   And what I say out loud currently is probably building on it.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.980]   But I say that we're seeking to worship God in all we do.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.300]   So we're seeking truth.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.140]   And for me and my kids and my husband, it's in everything we do, we want to worship God.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.220]   So am I just building onto that legacy without realizing it?
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.940]   Like probably.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.060]   How do we, you know, how do we keep that momentum?
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.880]   We talk about it.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:55.300]   I think, I mean, I think we all come to the point where we eventually do see it as something
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:02.100]   we intentionally want to pass on, that we intentionally cherish and want to pass on.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.820]   But maybe like you said, Olivia, not right at first.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.880]   We just are doing this thing that seems right and good to us at first.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.400]   Delise, what would you say?
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.660]   What's the legacy?
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:23.020]   And are you intentionally passing on a legacy when you look at homeschooling Leo?
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.660]   Well, I am now.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:33.240]   I will say the process of making that decision, you know, it was a partnership because, of course,
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.080]   I'm married as well to Evan.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.980]   And so my husband, he wasn't homeschooled.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.580]   He wasn't really exposed to any of the homeschool community.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:50.280]   And so homeschooling was definitely something for him to wrap his mind around.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.040]   Right.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.140]   And he was not entirely convinced.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.920]   Now, granted, Leo is three.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   So we could have had more time for him to become convinced.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.320]   He told me the other day, actually.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.700]   He said, honey, just look at me.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.840]   Am I not convinced?
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.760]   Don't you want this for our child?
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.540]   It would have been a no-brainer, but something weird happened there.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.120]   So he wasn't convinced.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:23.800]   And so I prayed a lot about it, but I knew I wanted it personally because I wanted it there
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.860]   for the moments.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.780]   And I remember how much I loved that my mom was there.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.420]   I was never one of those teenagers who didn't want their mom around.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.240]   I just loved it.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.480]   She's the coolest, and I still love it.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.280]   And that's why I want her to move across the street from my house.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.260]   I just want her there.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.000]   And so I hope that my son will feel that way.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.100]   But regardless, I know it's a gift to, like what you're saying, Olivia, to learn as you
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.220]   go with your parent.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.660]   It's just a really special and natural way to live.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.520]   And so I'm hopeful about that.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:02.760]   But then as we got to know Leo and as Evan continued to talk with me about just my thoughts
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.720]   of classical education and homeschooling and stuff like that, he started to see, we both
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:15.040]   started to see that homeschooling was absolutely the perfect fit for our son because of the way
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.700]   that he thinks.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:23.400]   And Evan is a very, very bright person who is a textbook case of falling through the cracks.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   So he's brilliant.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.820]   I mean, he has done so many things.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:34.800]   I could go on and on by way of just learning as you go, just like homeschoolers do.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.260]   However, in school, his teachers were constantly just telling him, hey, we know you're really
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.660]   smart.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.200]   Why don't you make better grades?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.980]   Why won't you apply yourself to this?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.140]   And the truth was he was bored.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.620]   He could see that the way that they were presenting the information was kind of like usurping the
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:50.880]   point.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.480]   And so he just spent his time doing something else.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.980]   And therefore, no one ever pushed him to meet his potential in school.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.420]   And it was just a true waste of his time.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.220]   And so I don't want that to happen to my son.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.040]   I can see that that's the way that we think.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.320]   Leo doesn't like to be, quote, tested.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.060]   He's going to have to work through that.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.540]   But also, there are a lot of ways you can assess a person.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.760]   So if a test is the only thing they're offering him to assess whether or not he's understood
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.720]   a topic, we have a problem.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.800]   Right?
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   So I'm excited about the flexibility that homeschooling affords, but also just the potential to help
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.820]   my son to rise to his potential.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.340]   And I selfishly want to be there.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.920]   Yes, yes, I know.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.400]   I think I talk to a lot of people about why they chose to homeschool.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.980]   And a lot of us are jealous of the light bulb moments.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.120]   Like I absolutely, that's one of the reasons I chose to homeschool.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.240]   My husband and I really loved being there for the light bulb moments.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:04.460]   When the understanding dawns and you see them thinking, and also this, and this too.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.380]   And the pieces get put together.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.940]   And then there's a thirst and an excitement.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.980]   And I did not want to give that away.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.740]   And that, I think, is a learning legacy.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:25.500]   If we can pass that on, I wanted to give my children memories of how fun it was to learn
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.460]   something new with mama and daddy so that we could all learn it.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:36.940]   There were things that we learned at the same time, like, you know, aha moments that struck
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.880]   me at the same time they struck this child of mine.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.540]   But that became a shared legacy.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.480]   And that is something that they still look back on and say, remember when we figured
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.780]   out how to do that problem.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.700]   Or remember when we both learned this thing.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.260]   And that's a legacy.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.940]   That is a family culture of learning.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.300]   I've heard my girls just tell people, yeah, we read books together.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.560]   That's just what we do.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.640]   Well, that's a legacy, y'all.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:11.720]   That anything that you do because your family did it, that has created an identity for you
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.920]   is awesome.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.940]   And so I know I am, I'm farther along this road.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.020]   And so I can ask myself this question.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:25.560]   I mean, I'm going to ask you too, but you're not going to have any idea if you can answer
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.300]   it now or not.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:35.660]   Like, what is it that you, what kind of legacy do you, are you hoping to create with your children
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.380]   children as you homeschool them?
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:45.400]   Because I've got girls that were homeschooled the whole way and I didn't know what I was
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.560]   doing at the beginning.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:53.820]   And so maybe I was like your mom, Olivia, that just said, I want them to appreciate truth and
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:34:00.300]   I want them to see that everything we learn is of God and from God.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:06.380]   But I didn't know a lot of that other integration stuff because it's not the way I was taught.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:17.460]   But I do know that now I hope that I have, through the learning that I did gradually, I hope that I
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:25.080]   put that in them so that it is a legacy of family learning and a thirst and an excitement about
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:30.380]   knowing things and knowing the Lord, I hope I placed that in their hearts.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:38.780]   And so I hope that I have passed on a legacy that they will consider valuable enough to pass
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.520]   on to their children.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:49.300]   So what I want to ask from, you know, I'll ask you first, Elise, how is, what kind of legacy
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.960]   is it that you're hoping to pass on to Leo?
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:35:00.740]   And do you hope that one day, you know, 25 years from now, he might homeschool his own child?
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.160]   This is such a big question.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.120]   I know.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.900]   And it makes you speculate because who knows?
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.320]   I'm going to choose to answer it just in the realm of homeschool and education.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.900]   And if you want me to go on more than how to talk later.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:27.760]   So as far as learning is concerned, I, right now, I really want to pass on to him the legacy
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.660]   of grace-filled learning.
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:35.800]   And I don't know if I feel that way because right now I just have one in the womb, you know,
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.700]   and one in front.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:45.720]   And I know that that is something that was given to me that he needs because for a firstborn child,
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:50.640]   for like a type A personality, it can be so easy to want to get everything right.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.420]   And I think sometimes that inhibits learning.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.780]   Yes, it does.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:02.160]   So I really want him to have that legacy because his father has that.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.480]   Like I can see it coming down from the other side as well.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.740]   His dad is so good.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:06.720]   He wants it to be right.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.900]   But he will try and he will try and he's not afraid of failing.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:16.960]   And so that causes him to accomplish a lot more, I think, than the average person because
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.420]   he's willing to try again and to perfect an art, you know, as much as we can as humans.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:29.440]   So I'm hoping that that grace-filled learning mindset is something that Leo really gets
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.340]   from us.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:37.500]   I'm also hoping, and this is more from my side of family, that Leo gleans a love of ideas.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   Like I have so many just happy memories of talking with my little brother specifically, but all
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.880]   my brothers, about ideas.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.480]   We just like to, we like to banter.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.100]   I've said that on the podcast before.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.980]   We like to entertain an idea and we like to tease it apart until it's like most dead.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.320]   And then we want to talk about it.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:03.720]   And I think the love of thinking is, is almost a lost art these days.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.340]   You know, we have a lot of podcasts.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.200]   We have a lot of people who, you know, you can self-publish, but people don't necessarily
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.460]   want to go deep on one topic.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.080]   And I think that is still important.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.480]   And I want to pass that on to my son.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:25.160]   And it's actually, I think it's the ability to use your imagination and to apply the things
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.700]   that you see to your imagination.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.420]   So I hope he gets those things.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:36.020]   Oh, that's a great, what an awesome legacy to leave.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.340]   If he gets those, he will be one lucky little man.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.500]   That's awesome.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.920]   All right, Olivia.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   So what is it that you, that you want to add to the legacy that your, your family gave
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.140]   you?
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.540]   What would you like to add to the legacy of homeschooling?
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:00.860]   I feel like I speak in too much abstract because I listened to Alicia, she's like sewing grace.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.880]   Like all these, I think it's great.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:10.240]   No, but I just, I feel like for me, it genuinely is, I think I said it already, but seeing that
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.900]   no matter what we're doing, that we're worshiping God, I really want that to be the heart of what
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.060]   I, what I teach them.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:21.840]   Even in the, even in the mistakes, when we mistake, when we make mistakes, either, either one of us
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.480]   sins relationally trying to do this school together, or we're not understanding something, to have
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:35.120]   repentance, ask forgiveness, all of that as a form of worship, to actually pray and to actually
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.660]   have good fellowship with one another, and then to go and thank God for all that he's done
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.140]   and have this life filled with this liturgy of worshiping God.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:48.160]   And that's, that's the biggest thing about my, my homeschool.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.580]   It's pretty much the reason why I homeschool and why we do what we do, why we learned, why
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:57.260]   we did memory master this year, how, you know, why we did math every single day.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.700]   Like that's, that's why we do it is so that it gives us something we can look at and then
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.400]   turn to God and give thanks and see him and see glorifying him in every single little
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.320]   thing that we're doing.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.400]   So that's kind of the heart of what I'm doing with my kids.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.460]   But if I had to think of a legacy of something that I know I do with them and that I know
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.700]   my mom did, and I can see all my grandparents have passed, but I could see looking back was
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:31.220]   the ability to just sit and observe, just to sit and watch and take in and be humble, not
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:37.480]   to say what you think right away, but to just sometimes sit and listen and take it in.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.280]   And be really understanding and open to what's going on around you, not to accept it all
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.140]   as truth, but to then just be able to sit and listen humbly and observe.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:53.240]   I think that that's a really important skill and can help you to love others really well
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.460]   when they feel that they can come to you or you can sit and look at creation and pay attention
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.240]   to what's really going on or listen to the news and try to listen for what's really happening
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.420]   so you can see through stuff that's just being pushed in your face, right?
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:11.460]   So I think being humble, being still, just paying attention to what's going on and listening.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:20.740]   This has been so refreshing and so encouraging to hear you guys talk about what you see as
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.960]   the legacy that was passed to you and what legacy you intend to pass on.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:32.420]   I can imagine that people may have clicked onto this podcast thinking, okay, they're going
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:41.500]   to talk about how we pass down the love of academics and how we pass down perseverance and hard work
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:53.980]   and those things are great, but the legacy that we want to pass down, the educational legacy that we want to pass down,
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:41:03.180]   you ladies have highlighted beautiful things, relational things, big idea things, heart things,
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:15.540]   the connection between who we are in Christ with who he calls us to be as we are learning about his world
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:26.000]   and as we're learning about how to live in a family and as we are learning how to live as stewards of the world
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.480]   that he has put us in is beautiful and that is what I want to encourage people.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:46.060]   That's the legacy that you're building, not a college scholarship, not a great job, not an immaculate transcript.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:55.540]   You are building a family culture of respect and learning and worship and that is a legacy.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.720]   worth leaving.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.240]   So thank y'all for having this conversation.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:10.200]   It could have been 15 different conversations and I had to keep pulling my mind back from the bunny trail
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.160]   that I would love to go down with you guys.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:19.580]   So, so listeners, you just keep listening because maybe we'll come back and talk with Olivia and Delise again
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.340]   and mine this legacy.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:31.700]   I just want to remind people that this season of the year is when a lot of our brand new Classical Conversations books come out.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.140]   The new books of 2025 are out now.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:41.280]   There's lots of math map books available now in the bookstore.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.220]   We've got digits and integers and fractions.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.760]   There are flashcards that would be an awful lot of fun to play with in the summertime.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:57.100]   Coming out that will be new and used in community in the fall is monomials.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.260]   And all of this math map work is an awesome way.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:11.600]   It's a classical presentation of math so that you can learn to worship the God of order as you learn to do computation,
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.420]   as you learn to build a good math vocabulary.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.420]   Something that our Challenge 3 students will be using is Reasoning Together Philosophy,
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.880]   but it is a really cool book for families to have at home.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.680]   There are excerpts of all kinds of philosophers that you could read,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.060]   short excerpts that you could enjoy with your family and talk about.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.120]   There are Copper Lodge library books.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.040]   There are four new Copper Lodge books out.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.280]   So many new things.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.260]   I can't tell you all, but I'll tell you what.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:51.860]   You can find out what's new by going to classicalconversations.com slash what's new.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.380]   I mean, you can find out all the skinny.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:58.900]   Classicalconversations.com slash what's new.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.460]   Go look it up.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.680]   It'll give you something to talk about with your family as you build a legacy.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.020]   And we'll see you guys next time.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.960]   Bye-bye.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   Bye-bye.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   Bye-bye.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.460]   you
