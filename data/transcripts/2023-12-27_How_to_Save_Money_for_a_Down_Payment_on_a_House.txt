[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   We move on to Kansas. Kansas, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.080]   Thank you. Thank you, Josh, for taking my call.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.360]   I have a quick question about how to, uh, I guess,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.600]   accumulate a large sum of money, decent down payment on the house.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.920]   Um, our income on a yearly basis is pretty good,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.840]   but I'm just not seeing how we can both live comfortably
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.840]   now and save a good enough down payment without making a huge sacrifice,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.000]   like moving in with family or a huge decrease in lifestyle.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.640]   So I was wondering if you could advise on how some people might get this done.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.680]   So the question basically is how could we free up more money in our budget so
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.200]   that we could accumulate this big chunk of money, right?
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.520]   Yeah. Or, or even make more money. I mean,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.000]   like my career, but I could, I could do better, I guess.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.760]   Household income is about how much?
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   Uh, breaking up just a little bit,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.440]   one Oh what?
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.620]   108.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.760]   Great. And your normal monthly living expenses in your current lifestyle are
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.600]   about how much?
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.660]   Uh,
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.120]   maybe we could modestly,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.760]   we could, we could get by maybe about 5,500.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.400]   And how old are you and your family?
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.800]   Uh, 38.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.680]   Wife is 38.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.920]   You're married and both of you are 38. Do you have children?
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.160]   We do. Yes.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.040]   How old are your children?
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.480]   Uh, one is out of the house. Uh, so three in the house, uh,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.880]   14, 12 and 11.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.720]   Okay. Uh, of the $108,000 of income,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.840]   how much do you earn and how much does your wife earn?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.720]   It's all me. She, she doesn't work.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.840]   And you're currently renting a home?
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.560]   Yes.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.880]   Where do you live?
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   In a suburb of Dallas.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   Okay. How much do you have saved right now?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.800]   Kind of embarrassed to say, uh, only a couple of thousand.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.080]   Okay. And do you have investments say like 401k IRA,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.200]   things like that?
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.840]   No, no. We, uh, we,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.120]   I had some years and years ago we cashed them out and just haven't,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.560]   haven't contributed in anything since.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.880]   Do you owe any money on anything? You have car payments, credit cards,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.080]   anything like that? Student loans?
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.880]   Student loans. That's it.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.160]   How much are the student loans?
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.640]   Uh, I think between the two of us, somewhere around
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.280]   80.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.760]   Okay. And the monthly payment on those, how much?
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600]   Um, right now
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.520]   maybe, maybe 150. I think it's another, it's 150 and something. It's very small.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.280]   Okay. So you're not paying those off aggressively or anything like that.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.360]   You're just paying them systematically and going to leave them on their normal
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   schedules, right?
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760]   I mean, yeah, obviously I would love to do it sooner than that, but we're just,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.680]   we've got that goal and we've got saving for a house and we're just like,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.680]   how do we get traction in any direction with,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.560]   with all the things that we want to do?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.200]   How much money do you need to save for a house?
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.160]   Uh, about, I'd say probably about 20.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.640]   $20,000? Yeah. Okay.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.280]   And what have you tried that has not worked up till now?
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.520]   Well, uh, the first thing was, uh,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.080]   just trying to, uh, to just
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.360]   save a little bit here and there to put towards debt.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.800]   So we paid off the credit cards, car loans. We've, we've been doing that.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.360]   So that's kind of where the extra has been going so far. But, um,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   with the larger amounts in the student loans were just like, if we just,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.880]   keep going after debt,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.000]   it might be a couple of years before we can get to start the saving.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Cause I was wondering if we should still just go that route or should we start,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.200]   you know, just, I don't know. I'm kind of, we're stuck here.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.080]   Okay. So the numbers of your situation are pretty respectable.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.400]   So let me begin with what I would say is probably at the core of it.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.720]   And I'm going to do it by asking some questions. These weren't,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.120]   these aren't original with me, but I believe they're really, really useful.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.400]   So let me ask you a question. You right now,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.480]   you have a 14 year old, a 12 year old and 11 year olds.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   You're 11 year old boy or girl girl. Okay. And you love her.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   I would imagine, right? Yeah. Okay.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   So I want to play a game.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.280]   I want you to imagine that your wife just calls you.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.680]   She's just left the doctor's office where she's taken your 11 year old girl.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.040]   And she tells you that she has some pretty bad news and she asks you to sit
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   down.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.200]   She informs you that the doctor has just told her that after some very detailed
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   tests with 100% certainty,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.840]   your daughter has a very rare terminal disease.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.480]   And this terminal disease exactly 12 months from today on December 22,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   2024, it will kill her no matter what this disease has a 100% fatality rate.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.120]   There is zero chance of her survival beyond 365 days from today.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.240]   Now there's good news and bad news. The bad news of course,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.560]   is that she's going to die.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.840]   The good news is that there is an antidote.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.040]   There is a treatment that is available.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.120]   The bad news of the treatment though, is that it's expensive.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   It costs $20,000 and the guy who developed the treatment that has a 100% cure
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.440]   rated absolutely will save her life as long as it's administered sometime prior
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.520]   to December 22, 2024.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.920]   This will save her life,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.640]   but the guy who develops it hates government and he hates insurance and he hates
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   charity and he hates debt.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.960]   So you have to pay for the treatment out of pocket and it costs $20,000.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.360]   You cannot borrow money to pay for it.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.040]   You cannot get government money to pay for it.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.920]   You cannot ask for friends and family to pay for it and health insurance will not
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.760]   pay for it.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.960]   You have to pay the $20,000 out of your own savings from money that you earn and
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.080]   do not spend.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.800]   So as a father, if you were presented with that scenario,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.160]   do you think that it would be possible for you to,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.360]   over the next 365 days,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.680]   save and accumulate $20,000 in order to save the life of your 11 year old girl?
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.360]   Yeah, yeah, I would.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.040]   You absolutely would, right?
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.520]   There's not a man in the world who would not. Every single one of us would.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.440]   So if that is true,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   then what it shows us is simply that this question is primarily a matter of,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.080]   this question that you're asking me is largely a matter of importance and
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.280]   emotion rather than of something technical or financial, right?
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.240]   It's a matter of if it matters to you enough, you will do it.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.120]   You haven't saved this money for a down payment prior to now because it has not
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   been important to you to do so.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   If it were important to you to accumulate $20,000 to buy a house,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.720]   then you would do so. And it's totally fine.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.960]   There may be many good reasons why it hasn't been important to you up till now,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.240]   but if you want to accomplish this goal,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.080]   then what you need to do is you need to dial up the intensity of the emotion so
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.800]   that you really,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   really care because if you really,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.880]   really care, you will find a way to make this happen.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.480]   So let's pretend that the emotion is super high, right?
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.080]   And there's this weird scenario and you really have to come up with the $20,000
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.360]   to save the life of your daughter.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.320]   What are some of the things that you would do over the next 365 days in order to
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.040]   accumulate this $20,000?
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.360]   Okay.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.680]   I think one would be look for ways to earn more.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.160]   Even if it's, you know, overnights, weekends,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.800]   whatever I got to do in addition to my full-time job.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.080]   I guess even prior to that,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.880]   I'd be combing through the budget with a fine tooth comb and
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.960]   cutting every Netflix and, you know, subscription and this and that,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.320]   that I had kind of going to bare bones, you know, wherever we could.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.160]   Yeah, those are the two things that mind first cutting expenses and increasing,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.800]   you know, what I bring in.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.040]   Right.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.920]   So those are your options.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.640]   And so basically when we're dealing with something that's on a one year timeframe,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.480]   so let's go back to the radical personal finance framework for wealth, right?
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.960]   There are five things that you can do with money that will build your
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.400]   assets. The first thing that you can do is increase income.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.320]   That's step one, increase income. Number two is decrease expenses.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.520]   That's the second part of the framework. You can decrease expenses.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.120]   Number three of the framework is invest wisely, invest wisely.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.600]   And we can go on for avoid catastrophe. Number five, optimize lifestyle.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.120]   On a one year timeline. The only two things that matter are one and two.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.880]   You can't invest on a one year timeline successfully for a goal like this and
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.000]   avoiding catastrophe and optimizing lifestyle is completely separate.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.280]   You're trying to optimize your lifestyle by purchasing a home.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.600]   So you have two levers that you can push the lever of increasing your income and
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.720]   the lever of decreasing your expenses.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.080]   And the question as to which of those levers you push has to do with what your
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.560]   opportunities are and how committed you are to the outcome.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.200]   So you can be hardcore. For example,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.040]   you could increase your income by working more hours and $20,000 is
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.240]   absolutely a goal that you could accomplish by working more hours. Years ago,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.800]   I forget the name of the guy's blog,
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.920]   but there was a guy who had accumulated a huge amount of student loan debt.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.600]   He was living in Texas and he created this,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.040]   he decided he was going to get out of debt,
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.200]   set himself a hardcore goal to get out of debt.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.080]   And he had a normal 40 hour a week job,
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   but he wound up building this side hustle business on the weekends of basically
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.960]   installing, I think it was like installing,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   I had a caller last week that was talking about like water features,
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.160]   something like that. He was doing some kind of construction work and he started
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.680]   out just doing it for a friend as a day laborer.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.280]   And then he figured out that he could do it.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.200]   And so he would spend his weekends installing things and he made thousands of
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.960]   extra dollars from doing just basically weekend handyman day labor work,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.800]   but where he was actually making real money,
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.280]   installing landscaping or something like that.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.040]   And so there's any number of side hustles that's available to you.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.760]   Some people will go out and they drive for Uber on the weekends,
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.600]   they deliver pizzas, they go and do landscape work, they pick up a night shift,
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.120]   they do all kinds of night and weekend work.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.280]   And that is one way that you can save and accumulate more money.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.680]   I don't usually recommend a lot of that stuff because the longterm return of
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.560]   those things is not often great.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.520]   And I prefer to have you focused on your career and say,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   how can you go from $108,000 to $158,000 over the next two or three years?
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.400]   That's generally where I spend most of my time. However,
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.520]   for a short term goal like this,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.440]   if you can find some kind of side hustle on the weekends that works for you,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.080]   then that can be a great winner. A lot of times there are things like tutoring.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.480]   There's any number of just basic ways to make money,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.040]   extra money on the weekend with assets that you currently have,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.760]   the car and the driveway, things like that, where you could,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.920]   you could save and accumulate, you know, $20,000. And by the way,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.800]   you may not even need to do the full $20,000.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   If you made $500 a weekend and you simultaneously were able to cut $1,000 a
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.520]   month from your budget,
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.440]   then you would be there basically in the course of 12 months.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.400]   And so there are ways that you could do that.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.320]   That would be the first thing to increase income.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.680]   There are other short term things that can be done. So what could you sell?
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.160]   Do you have a bunch of junk in the house that you could sell?
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.720]   Do you have a do you have a car that you could sell, right?
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.680]   Maybe you have a car that you don't need and it's worth $30,000 and you could
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.160]   replace it with one that would be worth $10,000 that would do what you need,
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.920]   but you could get 20 grand.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.560]   Well there's 20 grand that you could free up for a down payment on a house.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.120]   Look at other assets that you have in your home. So for example,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.320]   is there a way that your wife could earn money?
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.200]   Does she really enjoy photography and you have a good camera?
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.360]   And if she just told her friends, Hey, I'll do, you know,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.480]   baby pictures or things like that for you guys that she could go out and she
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.360]   could make three, four, $5,000.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.280]   Could she bake bread and sell it to all the neighbors? Could she, is there,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.720]   could she do something with her skills? Does she have professional training?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.400]   That if she worked for a little time here and there,
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.960]   there's some things that she could do.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.040]   I often don't love to get stay at home moms to focus on that because there's so
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.640]   much more that they can often do from a cost savings perspective and a lifestyle
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.320]   perspective. But if she's doing it for a year, that could be a great move.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.260]   Also with the age of your children,
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.460]   your children are very rapidly approaching independence.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.840]   And so unless you're homeschooling all the time,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.140]   then she may have time and she's been a stay at home mom for a long time.
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.300]   But now maybe there's some new, again,
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.340]   family business that she could start or some new enterprise that might bring in
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.420]   five or $10,000 this year and, and be a good longterm winner.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.900]   So look around and see what do we have? Well, we have time, we have stuff,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.220]   we have skills, et cetera. Don't neglect focusing on your career.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.240]   Go to your boss and ask and say, Hey, you know,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.280]   I've got some unexpected expenses. I need to make more money. Um, you know,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.600]   is there something that I could do if you haven't recently negotiated?
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   By the way, this is so full stop on that thought. Uh,
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.520]   is there something I could do? Is there a bonus that I could get?
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.360]   Is there a performance metric that I could hit?
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.880]   Is there some way that I could increase my income really substantially because I
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.320]   have a need to make more money? Now, full stop separate from that.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.600]   Then you, I ask you, have you recently negotiated your pay?
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.900]   Have you gone out and looked for jobs?
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.500]   A lot of times I have found that many of my clients,
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.100]   I'll get them just to go out and look for jobs, take a couple of interviews.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.960]   They'll get an offer and someone like you,
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.940]   you might be making $108,000 right now.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.100]   They've got an offer from someone that was making say 142, uh,
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.740]   something that's related to them. They don't really want to switch,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.620]   but now you can go back to your current boss and you can say, listen,
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.640]   I've got a job offer here for, for, from a competitor for $142,000. You know,
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.220]   I don't really want to go there,
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.240]   but I really need to make more money for my family.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.060]   And sometimes your current boss will go ahead and match the match the offer.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.380]   Um, you have to remember that if you're a good worker and you're, and you,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.500]   you're worth your money,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.020]   that for him to replace you as much more expensive than it is for him to pay you
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.940]   another 15, $20,000 in a year.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.760]   And so that would be something that you should consider.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.420]   So basically for short term thinking like this, for an aggressive one year goal,
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.280]   you really want to look and say, what are the big short term wins that I can make?
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.680]   Can I work extra hours? Can I do side work?
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.140]   Is there something that I could do related to my career?
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.300]   Can I renegotiate my current income?
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.860]   Can I get another job offer and then come back to my current boss?
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.340]   Can I sell some stuff to raise the money? What can I do? That's,
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.060]   that's number one is increase income. Number two is decrease expenses.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.740]   And so decreasing expenses is,
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.340]   has kind of the modest version and then the extreme version.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.500]   And you would choose based upon what's appropriate for where you are at this
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.120]   point in time. The modest version is what you said, okay,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.400]   we're going to cut Netflix. That's great.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.320]   It'll save you $240 at the end of the year.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.680]   I don't know if that's, that's not going to get you to $20,000.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.760]   So you need to go through the budget really carefully and say,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.680]   is there a way that we could cut expenses?
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.760]   Now the challenge that you will face in doing that is that the
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   expenses that you probably have are things that are investments into your
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.120]   children. So you've got sports clubs and team fees and, you know,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.600]   jujitsu lessons or those kinds of things. And,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.480]   and you have to balance the value of those as compared to what you're spending
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.600]   on it, but do go through your budget and reassess.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.400]   What I love to do and try to get people to do is you go through all of your
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.560]   expenses for the year,
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.440]   order them from biggest to littlest and then tackle them in that order,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.560]   because that's where you can often get the biggest wins.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.720]   I don't want you to start with the little skipping coffee stuff.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.240]   That's good. And you can do that, but I want to look for any big wins.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.280]   And so you talked about moving in with family because normally housing is one of
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.720]   your biggest expenses. You can calculate the price of that.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.800]   I don't know if that's something that you should do or shouldn't do,
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.760]   but it is true that ordinarily,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.040]   if you're stuck where you are and you can't figure out a way to get ahead,
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.720]   you should work with family. And I'm a hundred percent in favor of, you know,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.120]   the family unit, et cetera.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.480]   But there's a reason that immigrants who are willing to do unpopular things get
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.680]   ahead a lot faster than those of us who have grown more comfortable.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.640]   And so it's very normal that multiple families get a house together.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   Everyone doesn't have much space and immigrants who have that like hardcore,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.160]   we'll do whatever it takes mentality, get ahead very quickly.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.840]   So if there's a family member that you could go and stay with for six months,
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.640]   that might be all you need to make this happen.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.640]   If you eliminated your rental payment for six months and simultaneously you
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.720]   eliminated your, you know, your, your internet bill, your water bill, all the,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.560]   you know, all the stuff that could make a difference such that three or four or
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.000]   five, six months from now,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.480]   you could be able to be in a position to where you could afford to buy a house.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.600]   Also, by the way, that can be something, excuse me,
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.840]   that's something that's really smart for you to consider because it could make it
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.440]   easier for you to actually make the transaction.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.920]   And so let's say that you're coming up on the end of your lease at the end of
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   February, and you could get out now, put your stuff in storage, et cetera,
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.520]   and you could go and stay with family and start house shopping while also saving
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.920]   money. And you could just say, we're cutting everything down.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.160]   That plus the stuff that I've already said, for example, selling a bunch of stuff,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.480]   maybe you could raise $5,000 from garage sailing.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.080]   You could raise $5,000 from extra income and you could save $10,000 in three
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.600]   months of, of, of staying at your parents or something like that.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.280]   That's not that hard of a choice. If it means that you're quickly at a goal,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.800]   I would have no fear about doing some anything for three months.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.720]   That's perfectly fine. Three years. Okay. That's hard to recommend,
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.280]   but three months could be perfectly fine.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.240]   And then by already being out of a lease that then when you find a house,
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.160]   you're ready to move quickly and it's just a simpler process.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.400]   So I think that idea has a lot of merit as long as you could get there quick
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:57.720]   enough.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.640]   And if you could find something that's appropriate in terms of somebody's
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.800]   ability to help you, by the way,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.040]   one of the things that I like about this is this does allow family members to
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.840]   help you in a way that often they can't otherwise do when people don't
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.840]   accumulate money. As most people don't, it's hard for them to give cash gifts,
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.120]   but they can give very valuable gifts often in doing things like saying, Hey,
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.680]   come and stay with us. We'll put some extra cots in the, in the,
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.360]   in the study for the children to stay on or they can have bedrolls on the floor
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.520]   and we have one extra bedroom. And, you know, after all, they're at,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.280]   they're at school all day anyway. So let's just get, make it happen.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.680]   And oftentimes someone in that position would say, I'll,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.560]   even if my electricity bill goes up a hundred dollars and my water bill goes up
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.720]   a hundred dollars, that's fine.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.200]   I'll cover all of that because that's an easy way of contributing to the family
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.480]   or, and you just cover food or something like that.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.960]   And so doing something really radical like that could potentially give you quick
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.820]   action.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.340]   Now then you just go down the list and you systematically renegotiate each of
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.300]   the things that are on your list. And so how can you defray options?
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.140]   It may be the other way around.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.180]   It may be that you could bring in an extra border into your home right now.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.340]   Maybe that you could park, you know,
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.260]   somebody could pay you money to park in your backyard or something temporarily.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.780]   Look and say, how can I use the house to make a little bit of money,
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.060]   but go through the expenses systematically and cut them to the bone.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.260]   And then finally, I would just say that you mentioned, okay,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.700]   I'm not saving much for retirement or anything like that,
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.540]   but I think it'd be perfectly reasonable for you to stop doing any investing for
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:33.060]   retirement on a short term basis to accumulate for this kind of goal as well.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.100]   So some variation of those couple dozen things is probably going to lead you to
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.660]   where you want to be. Now, whenever possible, my final kind of tip is this.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.660]   If it's possible, uh, and, and
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.740]   whenever there's some kind of extreme lifestyle change,
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:56.140]   I do always look for a way to justify it to the best, you know, possibility.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.300]   So I always look for kind of a radical way to optimize it.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.100]   So here's the example. Maybe it doesn't,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.900]   maybe right now it's December,
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.980]   but are your children in just kind of a normal industrial school or are they
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.820]   homeschooled?
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.860]   They're in a normal public school.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.420]   Perfect. So you have, maybe it's here we are in December and you have, you know,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.740]   January, February, March, and April, but I don't know. Maybe your wife is from,
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.300]   is your wife from Texas as well?
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.380]   Or is she from some exotic foreign country that I can use as my example?
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.020]   And no, she's from the U S bummer. All right. Well, next time, Mary, uh,
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.660]   Mary in Italian or an El Salvadorian or something like that.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.140]   And the point is that sometimes there may be ways that you could do it.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.940]   And so you might do something like this summer vacation,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.060]   maybe June, July, August.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.740]   And what you do is you terminate your apartment or your current house
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.460]   in, um, in April,
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.100]   and you send the family to go and live on an organic farm in Mexico.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.580]   While you stay at your parents' house for three months and everyone's going to
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.820]   be homeless for three months, but it's only the summertime.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.580]   They're down there in language school and working on the, on the woofing farm.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.700]   While you're kind of working like mad going a hundred and 120 hours a
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.940]   week at three jobs. And then at the end of the summer,
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.340]   then you're in a position to where now we can go ahead and move into, uh,
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.220]   into a house.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.540]   And so what I'm looking for is a way to basically pull radical ideas,
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.820]   but then make them optimal.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.340]   So it may not be super fun to say,
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.060]   let's go and all live in one bedroom at
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.220]   dad's house. That may not be super fun,
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.740]   but if it's the summertime and maybe your eldest can go to grandma's house and
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.180]   then your wife and two younger children can go to grandpa's house and where
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.460]   they're going to be volunteering at a summer camp, uh, et cetera,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.340]   something like that,
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.660]   then that may be the time that you can be homeless for a few months and it's,
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.020]   it's okay. And as long as you have a backup plan,
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.940]   cause you may not be able to find a house or negotiate it.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.380]   So as long as you have a backup plan for what happens in August when they're
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.980]   back in school or something like that, then that can work. So look,
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.020]   think strategically about where is my family? What do we have?
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   What can we get rid of? What can we, how can we adjust?
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.060]   What resources do we have, et cetera. But at the end of the day,
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.060]   recognize that it's going to be your emotion and how much you desire this goal
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.300]   that's going to drive your, your actual decisions.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.620]   And probably you don't have to do all of these things to the max.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.300]   What I have found a lot of times is if you will set this as a clear intention
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.420]   and a clear goal, what will happen is you'll this month,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.100]   you'll find $500 a month that you can cut out of your savings. Sorry,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.340]   a cut out of your cut out of your spending this month cause you're just being
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.180]   sloppy. We are, we're all sloppy.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.300]   And so you can cut $500 a month out cause you care. Well,
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.100]   that's quickly got you on track for six grand at the end of the year.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.660]   You can go to your boss and you can say, boss, is there anything,
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.220]   are there any extra projects that I could pick up in exchange for a little bit
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.780]   higher compensation? Or is there something that you, that you,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.860]   that you've been wishing to get done? Cause I need to work some overtime.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.460]   And I thought it'd be best for me to work for my company instead of going and
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.740]   getting a side job and your boss may pitch you a project that, you know, here,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.260]   do this thing. And, and here's an extra eight grand.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.980]   This is worth eight grand to me to get this thing done in the next three months.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.300]   And so there's your, there's your side hustle right there.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.020]   And then your wife may have, again,
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   do a couple of photo shoots with her camera now that she's got time and doesn't
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.620]   have a bunch of little baby children around and she can go in and make a few
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.300]   thousand dollars. And then all of a sudden your father-in-law sees that, Hey,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.380]   these guys are going crazy. They're, they're really working.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.980]   They sold the second car and your father-in-law says,
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.860]   here's $10,000 to help you out. And boom, you're, you're done.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.500]   And so that's the normal course.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.980]   And so what matters is that you identify clearly what you want.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.180]   You figure out how to dial up the emotion,
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.380]   probably not with some weird tragic story like I described,
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.620]   but recognize that that what I described, you didn't hesitate.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.300]   Nobody ever hesitates. We know if I, if it mattered enough to me,
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.260]   I would get it done no matter how, I don't know how, but I would get it done.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.660]   I would find a way to get it done.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.500]   And so recognize that this is primarily an emotional problem,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.780]   not a logical problem, and then start working your way through the logic.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.900]   So that's how I'd approach it.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.460]   Thank you. Thank you. That, that definitely helps.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.020]   I think we were kind of
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.620]   struggling between priorities. And I think that you,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.820]   you kind of sharing this stuff really kind of put it in perspective.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.260]   A year's time is not very long, but as long as it's enough time to get it done,
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.820]   we were just, I guess, trying to make too much,
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.780]   too much traction in too many different directions.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.740]   And we weren't really moving much at all with regards to,
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.980]   you know, do we eliminate all the debt and try to just pay all that off first?
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.420]   Or do we say like, how do we do this? But I think you're right.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.620]   I appreciate that framework.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:52.660]   Right.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:57.420]   And what you should be doing right now is you should go and visit with a
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.400]   mortgage broker, a local mortgage broker,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.240]   get pre-qualified with a local mortgage broker to find out what
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.960]   specifically your borrowing capacity is on a piece of real
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.120]   estate, how much of a down payment you need,
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.680]   and then look around at houses in your area so that you understand,
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.840]   is there a house that would be available to us?
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.400]   I think that's a great thing to do because it'll nurture your desire, right?
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.240]   And in the same way,
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.360]   I really believe in creating a clear vision of what you want.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.640]   And so as a man,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.320]   it ought to make you angry to take your wife to a beautiful house and you
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.080]   walk through and you see your eyes light up and you think this would be a great
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.200]   place to raise my family.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.240]   And then you look yourself in the mirror and you get pissed off at what a bad
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.640]   provider you are, that you can't give your family what they deserve.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.680]   It's a pretty good, useful emotion to stoke in yourself.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.120]   And so go start looking at houses and build the desire and build the anger
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.960]   and holding those two things together as I find a really good,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.800]   good rule for goal achievement. If you have emotion,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   generally speaking, we work better if we just have one goal.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.080]   And so if you want to be debt free, then make your goal to be debt free.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.480]   But I don't think that you should, if your only debt is these student loans,
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.800]   I would go buy a house first, if you can make that,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.200]   if you can get a short term plan there. And then once you get the house done,
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.760]   then go back and get debt free.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:23.160]   But the key is to just choose one thing that you really want to do and then go
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.360]   all into it. And the point is that if you can do that,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.400]   we all of us can do almost anything for months at a time,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.000]   possibly a couple of years. We can't do anything for five years.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.560]   You know,
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.560]   if you think about living a life of deprivation and frustration and working for
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.920]   jobs, you can't do that for five years and make it.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.040]   Cause then you would be looking down and saying, well,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.680]   I'm not going to miss my teens years right now. Like this is,
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.000]   I'm not going to go work for jobs, but you can do anything for six months.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.760]   You can do anything for a year and six months or a year where everyone's on the
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.360]   same team, everyone's focused. All expenses are cut.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.440]   All available income is maximized. Everything that can be sold is sold.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.160]   That intensity of focus leads to incredible outcomes.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.800]   And so nurture that. And then everyone knows, Hey, six months from now,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.920]   we're going to be done with this.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.480]   We'll be in the new house and then we can go ahead and lighten things up,
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.320]   et cetera.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.640]   Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, Joshua. I appreciate you.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.840]   Call me back in a year and tell me about wrong, wrong mute button.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.120]   Call me back in a year and tell me about the, uh, the awesome house.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.320]   I would really love to, uh, love to hear about it and congratulations.
