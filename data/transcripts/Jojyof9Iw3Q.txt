[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Discernment is a good thing. It's an essential thing in the Christian life.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   But there's also a discernment gone wrong, something Pastor John addressed in his sermon on Romans 16, verse 17.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   What follows is a clip from his sermon, "Watch out for those who lead you away from the truth," preached on November 5, 2006. Here's what he said.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   How can dividing from a false teacher who rises up in the church promote unity?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   How can dividing promote unity?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Which is what he evidently believes it does, because he says, "Watch out for those who cause disunity.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Withdraw from them. Divide from them. Watch out for the dividers. Divide from them."
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   The only way you can make sense out of that is to believe there's some kind of division that's right and some that's wrong.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   What's wrong is the kind, or what's right is the kind that's based on those people having left the doctrine.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   So Paul's strategy here for preserving unity that he so long swore in the first part of verse 17 is to call for another kind of disunity,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   namely, that doesn't hang out with people who are on their way away from the doctrine.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   With regard to the command, "Watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you've been taught,"
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   it's possible to go overboard with that watching out. It's possible to go overboard.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I'm really hesitant to even say this, because I don't think we live in a world where that's our sin, by and large.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Some churches, some people, maybe it's not America's besetting sin.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So I'm hesitant, and yet I know that it happens.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And so I want to warn you against it and summon you back to a biblical balance.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   What I mean by going overboard with watching out is that you can become so obsessed with doctrinal error
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   that you lose the ability to rejoice in doctrinal truth.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You can. I've seen it. I've seen it. You can become so obsessed with purity, you cannot rejoice in the truth that should undergird it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I thought, it's like one of those dogs, they're beagles usually, who are trained to sniff out drugs at the airport.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And they're trained, maybe, I don't know, I've never seen one on his off hours.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   They're trained so completely to sniff out drugs that that's all they do is sniff out drugs.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   If you come into their house, they just go sniffing at you, sniffing at your purse,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and sniffing at your pockets, and sniffing at anything you have in your hands.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Well, this is not a way to welcome people in the church.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So, it's possible to become so obsessed, to be so trained in drug sniffing, that all you do is sniff drugs.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I mean, sniff trying to find them.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And I don't want us to go there as a church. I don't want to be there as a person.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   When I read the book of Romans, you step back and look at the whole book of Romans,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   yes, Paul pauses, chapter 3, chapter 8, these places he pauses and he draws attention to the mess people are making of his teaching.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   The sin that grace may abound, and he warns, but in the big picture,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Romans is just a magnificent display of the work of God in Christ for our salvation.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's a magnificent display that should cause us not mainly to say,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   "Now I've got ten weapons with which I can destroy enemies, but rather, I'm saved! I'm saved!
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I've got a solid rock under my feet! I'm going to heaven, I'll see Him someday!"
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So, let the spirit of delight in the truth be the main thing people taste at this church.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And then pray, especially for the elders, that we do have a good beagle nose
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   for any kind of slippage or any kind of movement that would be away from the apostolic teaching.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That was an excerpt from John Piper's sermon, "Watch Out for Those Who Lead You Away from the Truth,"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   which was preached on November 5, 2006.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You can find the full sermon at DesiringGod.org, just search for the title there.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And related to this, on the centrality of emotion in the Christian life,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   be sure to check out episode number 239 in this podcast series,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   which was titled, "Why Stoicism is Toxic."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Well, when it comes to joy and obedience, which comes first?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Does obedience come before joy, or does joy come before obedience?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Hmm. We'll ask Pastor John that very question tomorrow.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
