[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.520]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480]   And I just wanted to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.600]   This is the best time of year, my favorite time of year,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.440]   because I feel so grateful for all of you
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.440]   guys and my family and my friends.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.000]   And it's about just appreciating what we have
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.440]   and telling others why we do appreciate them.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.960]   I was just reading this article on Harvard Business Review
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.120]   called "Stop Making Gratitude All About You."
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.640]   The bottom line from the article is
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.720]   that you should use gratitude not only to appreciate
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.440]   the world more, but also to strengthen your relationships
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.520]   with those you rely on.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.440]   So expressing gratitude to someone
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.040]   who helps you keeps them interested and invested
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.080]   in having a relationship with you over the long haul.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.160]   This is truly important.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.240]   So think about the people you care about the most--
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.400]   your spouse, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your parents,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.840]   your relatives, and your close friends.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720]   When was the last time you told them, hey,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   I really appreciate you always being there for me
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.680]   when I have a problem?
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.200]   Or I really appreciate you being flexible,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.600]   coming to play tennis with me on my schedule.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400]   Or I really appreciate you always
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.680]   looking after our little one, because I trust you more
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.720]   than anyone else in the world.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400]   And I thought a little bit more about this article
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.080]   and how narcissistic it is for me to do this podcast
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   and also to write all these posts all these years.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.800]   Because I would say about 30% to 40%
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.840]   of my posts and podcasts are what's going on in my life
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.360]   and what I'm doing.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.520]   And so that kind of takes a narcissistic personality,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.880]   to be frank, right?
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.360]   But hopefully you guys appreciate some
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.840]   of my thought process that I want
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.380]   to share with you guys when it comes to investing in the stock
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.200]   market or real estate market or building a business online
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.280]   or whatnot.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.320]   And that helps you, motivate you to do something,
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.400]   and also helps you hopefully build wealth
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.800]   over the long term.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.320]   I'm obviously not going to get everything right, which
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.120]   is why it's so powerful to share my thoughts and feelings
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.760]   and ideas with all of you so I can
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.880]   get really critical feedback.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.560]   So I'm really grateful for those of you who really give it to me
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.400]   and call me out and say, hey, you know what?
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.080]   You're totally missing this viewpoint.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.840]   Or hey, why don't you do this?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   You didn't think about this.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.240]   I don't appreciate so much the people who are kind
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   of nasty in their feedback.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.360]   But those of you who really lay out
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600]   some really thoughtful feedback, I really appreciate it.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.640]   And I think other readers do as well,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.020]   because there are tons of people just reading the comments,
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.800]   lurking around, or listening to this podcast or whatnot.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.760]   And they're thinking, uh-huh, I never thought about that
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.260]   before.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.280]   And that's a really, really powerful, powerful way
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.240]   of living.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.780]   There's an interesting story by Ray Dalio.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.600]   He's the head of this $170 billion hedge fund.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.760]   And when he first started out, what he realized
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.680]   was that there were a lot of yes men, yes women, who didn't
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   really counteract anything he said.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.200]   And then eventually, he got something really wrong,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.560]   and his company almost closed down.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.600]   And this is when he thought, well, you know what?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.440]   I better get some outside perspectives.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.560]   And so now, in all his board meetings,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.920]   he has radical transparency where
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   his colleagues and other senior executives and just
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.280]   the junior guys just say, hey, Ray,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.760]   that was a terrible investment thesis.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   You missed this, this, this, and that.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.160]   And the whole idea of it is to avoid groupthink
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.280]   and avoid having all these yes people just
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.920]   agree with whatever you say.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   And I really don't want that as well.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.920]   I don't want every single reader to agree with what I say
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.720]   or what I believe.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.520]   We're all different.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   We all have different opinions, beliefs, goals.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.440]   And I think that's what makes Financial Samurai
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.960]   and the community special.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.040]   So please keep on providing honest feedback.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.920]   I love it.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.240]   To me, to other people in the community, in a respectful way,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.920]   we can all learn from each other.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.640]   Financial freedom, I think, is an inevitability for all of us.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   It's like my old favorite Chinese saying,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.840]   if the direction is correct, sooner or later,
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.200]   you'll get there.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.600]   I also want to use this podcast to highlight
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   how our wealth, I think, is mostly due to luck.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320]   Now, it's interesting because I wrote this post that
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.800]   got a lot of reaction and some quite negative.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.040]   One person was like, I absolutely
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.760]   disagree with your thesis that wealth is mostly due to luck.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.440]   And I am unsubscribing from your Facebook page.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.400]   And I was thinking to myself, wow,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.480]   I guess I really touched a nerve.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.640]   But my belief is that wealth, above average wealth,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   I would say is 70% due to luck and 30% due to effort.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600]   You can call it hard work, effort,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.320]   whatever you want to call it.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.920]   Let's not kid ourselves here.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   I think we're really, really lucky to be alive.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.400]   Many of us come from the United States
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.080]   or another developed country.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.120]   And we just have so much opportunity compared
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.320]   to billions of other people.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.880]   And I think the key is to recognize how lucky we are
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.440]   so we never take luck for granted.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.000]   For example, I've got this cough.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And frankly, it's kind of hard to speak.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.680]   I'm taking pauses here and there because it just
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.960]   tickles my throat.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   And I got it from my boy who's been sick off
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.160]   and on for the past couple of months
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.760]   because he's in preschool now.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.880]   And those viruses and bacteria just
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.000]   transfer over to the parents.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.120]   And it bums me out.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.880]   But you know what?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.440]   I'm going to do this podcast anyway
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.320]   because I don't want to take the ability to record this podcast
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.480]   and share my thoughts with you for granted.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.880]   I promised myself and I promised all of you guys
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.760]   that I would record at least one podcast a week
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.520]   for the whole year and just see how it goes.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.800]   And I'm going to do that because half the battle is just
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.520]   showing up and continuing to go on and on no matter what.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.480]   So I don't want to take my luck for granted.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.320]   And I wanted to share some really lucky points in my life
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   that has helped me achieve financial independence a little
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.080]   bit sooner than average.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.120]   So first of all, my biggest lucky break
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.840]   was that I was born into a stable dual-parent household.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.760]   My parents worked in the US Foreign Service,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.920]   which enabled me to live in five countries
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.720]   before coming to America at age 14.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.640]   And they also speak Mandarin, [SPEAKING MANDARIN]
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.960]   So with this type of background, I mean, chances are greater
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.840]   you'll be able to speak a couple languages,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.560]   interact with people from dozens of cultures,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   adopt a zest for travel, be more understanding
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.400]   towards people of different cultures,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.720]   and have a broader world view.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.000]   And because of this background, I
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.480]   think it's helped me get a job easier.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.440]   After all, I joined the International Equities
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.560]   Department at a major investment bank.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.800]   And I don't know if a non-target school alumni could
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   have got this job if I didn't have
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   this international background.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.080]   I screwed up a lot in high school, a lot.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.480]   You know, I was caught shoplifting.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.200]   I did a lot of other illegal things with my buddies.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.600]   This was a public high school.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.400]   I got suspended for fighting.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.920]   All these things that I look back and I'm thinking to myself,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.240]   man, I was a juvenile delinquent.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.720]   I mean, I did study hard, but only after freshman year
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.880]   when I got in real lot of trouble.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.920]   And I paid for my transgressions.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.520]   But the College of William and Mary gave me a chance,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.880]   and I'll never forget it.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   And it was not that easy, because think
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.360]   about your time in college, where you got in trouble
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.680]   in high school.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.520]   And you didn't know whether all your hard work in college,
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.080]   trying to get those good grades, would mount to anything.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.040]   Because, hey, what kind of employer
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.400]   would want to take a chance on you?
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   But again, I got lucky again, and I got a great job
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.480]   in New York City.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.920]   And it was all because of this one woman, Kim Perkis,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.560]   who believed in me.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.400]   She pushed me along in the recruiting process,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.560]   brought me into various desks, didn't give up on me.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.520]   I had 55 interviews, not because the process was
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.040]   that elaborate, but because I just kind of stunk
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   at interviewing with various desks.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.640]   I interviewed on the US trading floor.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   What else did I do?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.840]   The derivatives desk.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.680]   I had no business interviewing with those guys.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.960]   And then on the internationals desk.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.400]   So I was just getting thrown around left and right.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.240]   And I don't think anybody really believed in me,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.520]   except for this one woman.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.160]   Other lucky breaks.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.840]   During the 2000 dot com boom, I invested in VCSY,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.760]   a Chinese internet stock that climbed 50x.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   I mean, that was nuts.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.840]   I invested 3,000 and went to 170,000.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.280]   And I sold it for 155,000, just because I was like,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.080]   well, I don't want to lose all my money.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.600]   And then a year later, the stock basically went to a penny.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.240]   So that was a really lucky break.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.680]   And if you go and read the post,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.080]   I highlighted 15 lucky breaks.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   And what I want to do is really encourage you guys
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.840]   to look back in your lives and highlight
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.560]   what are those lucky breaks that have helped get you
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.240]   to where you are now.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.720]   And it feels really great.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.880]   Every time we do this, or every time I do this once a year,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.180]   or maybe once a quarter, it just makes me feel
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.680]   so much more appreciative.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.920]   And I get pumped up to try harder.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.160]   And the best lucky break that I've gotten
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   was meeting my wife in college.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.320]   We met in Japanese 101 class.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.080]   So this is how Financial Samurai started,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.520]   I think, back in 1998.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   That's right.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.200]   I was a senior.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.520]   She was a freshman.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.880]   I wanted a cruise so I could just relax my senior
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.080]   and find a job.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.400]   And it was so fortuitous to meet her,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.800]   because we ended up dating and sticking together
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.000]   for over 20, 21 years now.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.960]   And that's really, really a lucky break,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.120]   finding your life partner so early on when you're so young,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.720]   when you both have pretty much nothing,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.400]   and then just going through the cycles of life together,
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.680]   the ups and downs.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.840]   It's so much easier to live when you
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.480]   have a partner who's always supporting you, who
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.100]   can be there for you when you have rough days, who
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.480]   can encourage you to keep on going,
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.840]   and just to play off each other's energy and strengths.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.400]   It's such a blessing, because I do the front end
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.440]   on Financial Samurai, and she does a lot of the back end--
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.480]   the taxes, the finances, the admin stuff.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.760]   And I just couldn't continue for so long without her.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.040]   So I'm really, really blessed.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.480]   And I hope we have 40-plus more years together.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.920]   I really hope none of us take so much of our good luck
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.160]   for granted.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.680]   I'm trying my best not to.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.320]   And the best way I can appreciate my luck
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.120]   is to make an ongoing commitment to keep Financial Samurai
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.840]   running, whether through writing,
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.200]   or through this podcast, or responding to comments,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.800]   and emails, and so forth.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.840]   There's a lot of work involved, but I'm
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.440]   going to continue so long as I'm able.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.560]   Because frankly, I know a lot of people who are unable,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.320]   whether it's because they can't speak, they can't see well,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.800]   they can't come up with ideas, whatever it is,
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.920]   I will not take my vision, my voice, my mind, my body
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.960]   for granted.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   And I hope none of you guys do as well.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.960]   Roughly 15% of the world's population
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.440]   has some sort of disability.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.600]   That's a billion people, folks.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.440]   Meanwhile, out of that 1 billion,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.680]   200 million have a severe disability
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.160]   where it really impedes normal everyday functioning.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.880]   So let's not forget our brothers and sisters.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.060]   If we are able-bodied people, let's just keep on going.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.040]   Let's use what we've got and do our best,
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.920]   and also help those who do not have what we have.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.560]   Sooner or later, we're all going to get unlucky.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.800]   And when we do, we must accept bad luck as a part of life.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.280]   But we should also remind ourselves
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.360]   during bad times about all the lucky breaks
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.640]   we've experienced so far.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.200]   Then we've got to rise up and just move on and just
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.880]   keep on going.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.880]   So I'd love to hear about all your lucky breaks
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.680]   in your lifetime in the comments section, or an email,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.400]   or in the forums.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.760]   And I want to know how much you think luck plays a part
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.280]   in your success.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.160]   I have a survey in the post that has about 3,700 entries.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.920]   And it looks like the number one vote-getter
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.720]   is that luck plays 50% to 69% a part of your success
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.800]   and wealth.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.760]   The number two vote-getter-- it's interesting--
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   it's only 25%, 49% luck.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.320]   And the number three vote-getter, 70% to 89%
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.400]   is luck.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.040]   So I want to thank everyone once again for all your support
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.600]   all these years.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   Without you, Financial Samurai would not
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   have been possible, because I really feed off
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   interaction and feedback.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.240]   It's just so fun.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.840]   Every day I wake up, I'm excited to see
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.120]   what happened in the world and on financialsamurai.com.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.840]   It kind of feels like Christmas every morning when I was a kid.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.760]   And I'm feeling really blessed to have
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.240]   that feeling every single day.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.960]   So thanks so much, and I'll see you guys around.
