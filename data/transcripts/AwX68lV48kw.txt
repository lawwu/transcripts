[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.160]   - We're honored to be joined again by author
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.960]   and speaker Paul Tripp on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.520]   As we finish out this week,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.960]   he is the author of the book, Sex and Money.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.560]   Paul, we recently polled DG readers
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.360]   on their use of technology,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.480]   and 8,000 of our readers responded.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080]   And those who admitted to an ongoing use
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.840]   of internet pornography,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.480]   it was clearly a particular struggle among men.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.520]   Women struggle at a far less rate,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.280]   but for both men and women,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.940]   the struggle is stronger the younger the person.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.760]   And almost 50% of men, 18 to 29,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.500]   the youngest demographic that we polled,
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700]   almost 50% of men here who read Desiring God
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.280]   admit to ongoing struggles with porn use.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.360]   But what's also interesting is that most of these men
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.760]   have accountability structures in their lives.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.920]   So this is not a surprise to others.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.360]   Other people in their lives know this is a struggle for them.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720]   So what would you say to a Christian man
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.000]   who is stuck and trapped in this powerful sin?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.820]   - The first thing I would say,
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.160]   and I think this is very important,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.840]   it's a cultural analysis.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.280]   I don't think we do these kinds of cultural analyses
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   as much as we should.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.440]   You have to understand, you now live in a pornified world.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.040]   Pornography is Western culture.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.000]   It's everywhere.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You'll never safely escape the pornographic influences
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.880]   of the surrounding culture.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.720]   You just can't.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.320]   You can't look at your computer,
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.560]   you can't follow the news, watch television,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.620]   go to a movie, read a magazine,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.720]   go to the mall for Pete's sake,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.820]   without having your morals assaulted.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.240]   So you have to understand the world that you're living in.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.840]   Don't be naive.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.320]   The thing that somehow you can purify your environment
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.680]   to the place where it won't be a problem for you.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680]   We are all gonna be faced with the temptation
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.900]   we just need to get a grip.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.120]   Second thing is, I think that we haven't talked about
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   the why so many Christian men are addicted
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.880]   to internet pornography.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.080]   And I wanna say it this way.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.320]   If I've accepted, and I think many, many Christian men
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.920]   have done this without knowing it,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.320]   that sex is fundamentally about my pleasure.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   That it's, let's say in marriage,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.180]   it's a legal means of me getting pleasure.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.780]   And that's what drives me in marital sex.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.780]   And so what happens when I'm in the sexual bed with my wife,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.240]   I don't care about her.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.880]   I don't care about God.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.640]   I don't care about loving and serving her.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.140]   All I care about is getting off.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.040]   All I care about is my satisfaction.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.040]   Now what that does is that reduces sex
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.560]   and reduces my wife to an object for my pleasure.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.280]   I'm gonna say this.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   She becomes little more than a tool of my masturbation.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.220]   It's totally anti-relational sex.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.520]   It's not about relationship with God.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   It's not about relationship with my wife.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.560]   In fact, the physical relationship,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.760]   my love relationship to that person
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.640]   almost doesn't exist in that moment.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.240]   It's just my body getting what my body wants.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.360]   If that's happened and she has now been objectified,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   I have little defense against the computer
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.540]   which offers me the same thing, because it's all about me.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.540]   And in fact, the computer may be a more efficient tool
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.600]   of sexual climax than my wife is.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.240]   What defense do I then have?
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.560]   But see, if it's been about God,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.600]   if it's been about relationship,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.160]   if it's been about loving her and loving God
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.240]   and wanting this thing to be what God designed it to be,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.960]   the computer is weird, strange, and out of place.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.680]   And so I think that what is being revealed
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.080]   is not a problem with the computer.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.120]   What's being revealed is a problem
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.040]   that exists in our marriages,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   that exists in our low view of sexuality and marriage,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.440]   that set us up to be defenseless against this temptation.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.080]   - So singleness is an opportunity
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.880]   to die to this lie that sex is selfish,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.480]   a lesson that any man or woman will need in marriage.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.400]   - It is a key place where contemporary singles
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.840]   can submit to the fact that in all areas
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.520]   of boundary setting, God is smarter than me.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.200]   - Very good, thank you, Paul.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.080]   I appreciate this.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.420]   And if you're looking for solid wisdom
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.120]   on fighting sexual sin, see Paul Tripp's book,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   "Sex and Money."
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.560]   We must break for the weekend,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   but we will return on Monday.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.160]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
