[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.920]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.160]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you here.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.920]   As I mentioned in my short episode a few weeks ago, I want to bring more travel
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.680]   and credit card points content to this show in 2022.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.600]   So I am excited to be joined today by Richard Kerr.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   Richard's a veteran Naval officer who left that career behind to become one of
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.600]   the top experts in the world on travel loyalty programs, credit cards, and
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.360]   points strategy.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.800]   He's the founder of the Award Travel 101 Facebook community and spent six years at
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.320]   the points guy as a contributor, an editor, and the director of travel
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.960]   partnerships.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.080]   He's now at the up and coming credit card company, Bilt, running travel rewards.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.000]   We're going to talk about where he thinks points and miles programs are heading in
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.880]   2022.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.280]   We're going to hear some of his favorite redemptions out there, learn all this
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.440]   travel hacks, both on the booking and travel side and get an update on the new
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.480]   Bilt card and how to get off the wait list.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.480]   I am sure I'm missing a few things because there is so much to cover.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.520]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.880]   Richard, thanks for being here.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.520]   Hey man.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.280]   My pleasure.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400]   And that word you use to describe your show, upgrading.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.160]   I'm all about it.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.680]   Yeah, I'm constantly seeking out upgrades in all aspects of life.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.240]   So before we get started, I would love if you could just share what led you down
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.960]   this rabbit hole.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.840]   Yeah, a really long story short is I was in the Navy.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.200]   And at one point I had to choose between spending $3,000 on last minute economy
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.720]   tickets to see my family after I had not seen them for a year because of
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.400]   deployments or just skipping Christmas and not seeing them.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.360]   And I chose to spend the $3,000 from my wife and I thought there
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.080]   has to be a better way.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   Luckily I found that better way.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.160]   And for whatever reason, it clicked with me and down the rabbit hole.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.600]   I went spending the next almost seven years in the Navy, being able to travel
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.280]   around wherever we were stationed, having family travel, thanks to points
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.400]   and miles and I took it and literally and proverbially ran with it.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.120]   And can you briefly touch on what you were doing before points and miles?
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.640]   So before doing points and miles full time, my last job in the Navy was the
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.240]   logistics officer for Marine one, the president's helicopter.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.680]   I got there when president Obama was leaving office and president Trump was
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.000]   coming in and I had a lot of jobs there to make sure that helicopter could fly
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.200]   the parts gas all over the world, but the one thing I'll let you, the inside
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.400]   tip on that president Trump loves his tropical starburst and his Pringles.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.320]   The man hammered them.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   So we had the credit card of which was of course not earning any points
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.280]   because it was a government card, but a lot of starburst Pringles for
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.440]   Marine one in my last year, the week would finish and I would have a trip
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.320]   plan to hop somewhere for the weekend, wherever we were, of course, on points
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.560]   and miles and my love and decided that I want to do this full time.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.920]   Navy has been great, but I'm out.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.000]   So you've, you've built up probably an arsenal of knowledge
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.440]   that, that few others have.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.960]   So just to kick off, I want to talk about the current state of things
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.880]   and the points and miles world, and maybe recap where we're at and
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.160]   what some of the big things happening in the last few years are.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.120]   And maybe we start with airline and hotel programs and I'll kick us off
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.480]   saying, I think one of the biggest trends I've seen, and I'd love to hear
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.360]   your kind of take and maybe explain what it means is this kind of trend
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.240]   towards these fixed redemptions to a more dynamic program.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.480]   You know, it's what the programs in my mind should exist
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.840]   to drive a recurring business.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.440]   And you might think that's very simple.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.360]   What is turned into for many airlines and hotels is it's a
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.320]   revenue arm more than anything else.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.200]   And in the case of most of the big airlines and some of the hotels, the
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.280]   revenue arm that is the loyalty program is worth more than the airline itself.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   We saw during COVID several of the large carriers take out loans against their
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.280]   loyalty programs to get cash, to keep operating.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.800]   And once that they figure this out through all kinds of deals and
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.960]   partnerships and, you know, passengers and hotel guests being willing to buy
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.640]   points at what I think are crazy rates that said they honed in on it.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.360]   And that's led to the state of what we see today and most large loyalty
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.440]   programs, which is nothing is fixed.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.760]   Nothing is predictable and everything is designed to drive maximum revenue
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.280]   rather than, in my opinion, in most cases, earn repeat business.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.080]   Now you might think that's really bad thing at the end of the day, you and I,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.160]   and people who listen still get to do amazing things because of points and miles.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   So it's not all doom and gloom.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.240]   It's just a different environment than we're operating in.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.320]   So a couple of listeners have sent me this YouTube video that I'll link to in
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.880]   the show notes where I can't remember the name of the guy who did it walks
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.840]   through here is exactly how these businesses work and why you should really
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.080]   think of the miles programs as banks almost.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.360]   And so I'll put that, yeah, I'll put that in the show notes, but, and just
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.920]   to clarify, it used to be that there was a chart and it said, Hey, if you want
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.960]   to travel from the United States to Europe, it's this many miles.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.720]   So that's what it is.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.560]   And now I don't know if there's any airline that's fully a hundred
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.440]   percent dynamic dollar for point other than the ones who've always
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.120]   done it Southwest and JetBlue.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.800]   But, but the main American Delta United, you can still get some of
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.560]   those low cost non-dynamic awards, but they've taken all of the award
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.480]   inventory that's not at the low price and made it seemingly sometimes, at
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.560]   least with Delta, it's I'm not going to spend a million points to fly to
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.680]   New York this weekend.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.800]   Yeah, no, there's overall, there's still deals to be had.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.360]   And actually bring up the point of Delta.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.240]   I can't keep Delta miles in my account because I'm constantly redeeming
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.640]   them for economy domestic flights.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.280]   Because in the world of dynamics, as high as things may be, there are still
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.160]   low deals out there all the time.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.880]   And maybe it's because I'm an Atlanta guy, but oftentimes Delta is
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.200]   the most expensive out of Atlanta.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.600]   But to your point, every currency and program now almost has its uses.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.240]   If you want to fly luxury premium classes, don't collect Delta sky miles.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.360]   If you want to get your family of four to the beach or grandma's
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.880]   house a few times a year, I think sky miles can make it happen.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.120]   So along with the bads of, you know, now some redemptions are crazy priced.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.520]   Almost every program does have the great deals.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.160]   American has these web fair deals where you can fly one way in the
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.280]   U S for 5,000 miles to like really good, like on the weekends on holidays.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.000]   So it's just kind of wild.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.160]   And to my mind comes back to, there's, there's no predictability left.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.600]   You're not really sure what to prepare for.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.240]   And what do you think about hotel programs?
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.960]   What's been going on with hotel loyalty?
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.880]   I always try and figure out a better and more polite way to say this, but I usually
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.320]   fail, unfortunately, Marriott has destroyed its program to a point where I don't know
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.080]   why you would invest in the bond boy program anymore, and I'm sure you have
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.360]   lots of listeners who are going to be up in arms about that because they love their
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.440]   Marriott, but we're a couple of weeks out of time of recording from award charts,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.920]   being completely Marriott it on a good day is a broken disaster.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.760]   The phone agents are not empowered.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.680]   Social media team can't do anything for you.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.640]   Probably a high likelihood, your points are going to be calculated
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.400]   incorrectly from every stay and goodness.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   If you have certificates in points that you want to combine or use
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.760]   do anything outside of the norm.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.280]   It's just not going to happen.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.040]   So it's really a shame because SPG was amazing.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.240]   Marriott rewards is pretty good.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.280]   They've combined them and they've just, I have no idea what the strategy has
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.680]   been over there, except trying to minimize costs for hotel owners.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.040]   So Marriott, I'm sorry.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.240]   I just, I'm going to go to the portal and earn 10 X venture rewards rather
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   than trying to collect the points.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   As far as everyone else goes, there's still a gold standard in my mind
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   of, of hotel programs, which is the world of Hyatt and their points
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.160]   are just incredibly valuable.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.360]   You can book luxurious aspirational stays as easily as you can book again,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.880]   that room for your family where you just need to stay next to the airport for one
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   night and then everybody else has got their uses.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.720]   I mean, Hilton continues to offer huge signup bonuses to continue to be able
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   to find value there as a traveling family.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.400]   Again, you can now book connecting rooms with points, which we just
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.640]   did in Orlando, which is great.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.200]   I'm not a big fan of what they've done with some of their elite benefits,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.560]   like not giving free breakfast anymore, but it's fine because
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.840]   I just go and stay at Hyatt.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.440]   So overall, I think it's still a war charge going by the
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.640]   wayside, except for Hyatt.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.680]   It's not predictable how many points you're going to have to
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.640]   need or you're going to need anymore.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.800]   And it's all about maximizing the revenue off of these programs rather
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.160]   than encouraging repeat loyalty.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.120]   So it's very interesting to see how quickly it's changed.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.400]   And what do you think happens in the coming years?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.360]   Are, is Hyatt going to follow the way of Marriott is what changes do you
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.800]   think happened 2022 and I guess beyond to these programs, both airline and hotel?
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.520]   We can talk for a very long time about the difference with hotel loyalty
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.600]   programs is that the majority of the hotels in these programs are not owned
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.800]   by Hyatt or they're not owned by Marriott.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.040]   They're owned by individual investors who pay marketing and licensing and
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.800]   program dollars to the big corporate.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.000]   But ultimately they have a huge say to Marriott that says we're not
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.840]   going to do this elite breakfast because it's too expensive for us.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   And you don't reimburse us enough.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.360]   And the corporate tie hands are tied a little bit, as far
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.600]   as most of the programs go.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.520]   I think what we're going to see happen, which we've seen a really
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.000]   big uptick in 2021, the beginning of 22 is hotels actually
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.040]   leaving programs like Marriott.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.960]   They've lost a couple hotels in Venice in the last few weeks, and they've
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.320]   lost tons of properties to Sinesta.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.960]   And if you haven't heard that hotel chain Sinesta, I guarantee you, you're
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.640]   going to hear it over the next couple of years, that they've almost tripled
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.720]   in size in just the last two years by acquiring hotels that are leaving
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.320]   programs like IHG and Marriott.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.160]   And unless those franchise agreements are fixed, I don't see things getting better.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.240]   Now what Hyatt has done a good job is their franchise agreements and their
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.560]   terms and conditions of the program are written so that there's very little gray
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.160]   area, like the properties know what they're getting into, they know what
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.120]   they're going to get reimbursed.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.480]   And Hyatt does a great job of making sure that things are executed well.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.600]   So I don't think, and I don't hope we're going to see Hyatt go the
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.880]   way that other programs have gone because of how they've structured
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.240]   these agreements with the property owners and how popular that program
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.160]   really is and continues to be with its members, like the program
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.880]   really does drive repeat guests.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.600]   So I hope we see things kind of stay where they are.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.640]   Um, as far as these programs are going to continue to struggle in this
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.200]   program's going to continue to do really well.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.840]   Do you think anything changes with flights and flight airline loyalty this year?
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.440]   If you'd asked me that last year, I would have said no, but then American
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.160]   came out and said, we're going to completely redo how elite qualifying
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.600]   works in our program, and it's really quite interesting, and I think it's great.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   If you're not familiar with American loyalty points, give that a quick
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.920]   Google on the machine and read up, but basically you don't need to fly
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.960]   American anymore to get elite status, which is really quite amazing statement
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.160]   to say you can earn status off of spending on their co-branded cards,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.200]   off of shopping with their partners, booking hotels and vacations through
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.080]   them, and you can go fly American twice a year and have top tier status.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.760]   I would argue rather easily, um, for anybody that's really trying.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.400]   So that's really interesting.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.920]   And it's going to be, uh, even more fascinating the rest of this
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.280]   year to see how that goes and how it's picked up and typically
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.240]   in the airline industry, it's rather copycat what airline aid does,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.160]   at least amongst the big three BNC are quick to follow.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.040]   So I'm sure Delta and United are watching with great interest, how
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.640]   this is working and what kind of revenue is going to drive for the
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.040]   advantage program, um, of which I'm a loyal member of American, which
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.600]   we can talk about for several reasons, but I think it's great.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.480]   I think it's interesting and we will see American could turn around
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.440]   if they don't like what they see after the first year and say, that
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.640]   was a really interesting experiment, but, uh, no more, or we could see
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.760]   Delta United go, you know what?
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.520]   That's a great idea.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.080]   Let's follow.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.320]   And you don't even need to fly airlines anymore to get status, which
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.960]   again, is a remarkable statement.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.280]   I hack here.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.320]   I have listeners sometimes write in and say, you know, I have this business.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.160]   I'm spending millions of dollars a year, and it seems to often be on
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.680]   categories that are nothing right.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.440]   This, someone said, I'm a contractor.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.200]   I spend almost a million dollars a year on hardware and supply stores,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.480]   and I could put it all on a credit card.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.760]   What should I do?
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   And I, you know, I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.600]   It kind of is a very personal question, but if you value status on American
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.320]   and you've got a bunch of spend, that's not going to earn you five points.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.760]   There's four points or three points.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.240]   An option is to use that spend to buy yourself American status at
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.480]   least this year, and, and we'll see how long that lasts.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.440]   Cause on top of that, you get redeemable miles as well.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.000]   And American miles are fantastic.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.920]   Great value to do luxury or weekender flights around.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.800]   So I find myself very much more engaged with the advantage program,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.760]   which is what they're hoping for, you know, shopping portals and things
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.640]   like that, American offers earn you status.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.080]   So I could tell the wife, Hey, if you're going to be doing any shoppers,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.440]   we can, you know, to go to that advantage shopping portal, right?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.240]   Cause we want status again next year.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.520]   The shopping portals, I think are, are underrated in that
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.080]   sometimes it's, it's a point here.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.200]   You could, you could use Rakuten or anything to get a point.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.040]   And sometimes you get these crazy offers where it's 10, 20 miles per dollar.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.240]   And so, you know, it's frustrating to look, I think there's a site I'll
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.440]   link it in the show notes and I want to say it is cashback monitor cashback.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.040]   And they'll, they'll give you both the shopping portals and the
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.600]   cashback portals for both of them.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.320]   And it's pretty cool.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.560]   They, sometimes those I've gotten 10, 10 points per dollar
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.600]   before on, I think, I think American.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.760]   So at the end of 2021, a crazy deal came out.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.440]   That was for every dollar you donated to conservation international which
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.560]   is like a featured mastercard charity.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.880]   You got 40 miles per dollar and you're thinking, Hey, that's pretty good.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.320]   But at the end of the year, American also had a five X on
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.560]   all portal bonuses going on as well.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:47.880]   So you got 240 American miles per dollar donated to conservation international.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.160]   Um, and American honored it and people went all in on this thing.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.400]   Like I have friends and colleagues that donated $25,000 to conservation
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:01.520]   international to get millions of American miles at they, they prefunded
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.760]   five years or 10 years of travel for 25 grand all in business class, by the way.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.600]   Cause once you have 20 million American miles, like it doesn't matter.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.120]   You can book whatever you want, whenever you want.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.240]   And it's really quite fantastic.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.520]   It sounds like a story from days of the past, but this was six weeks ago.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.520]   And I did get a little taste of it.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.720]   I did donate, uh, I think 300 bucks and got 72,000 American miles, which
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.920]   is more than enough to fly business class across the Atlantic.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.560]   So I look at just buying business class for 300 bucks.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.080]   That's crazy.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.280]   I've been trying to think about, I've never been the social media
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.880]   person is just like all over it.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.640]   I looked at a survey I did with listeners and they're like, that's what they want.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.360]   So I'm going to start using my social media solely to just post
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.720]   when these crazy deals come out.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.560]   So, so, you know, give me a follow.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.080]   If you want, I'll stay on top of them.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.440]   Sorry.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.040]   Sorry for everyone who missed the American one.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.400]   I also missed it at the end of the year.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.360]   It was just too crazy.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.880]   But, um, you know, on top of that, I guess you probably get a
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.120]   tax write-off on the donation.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.600]   You do, it keeps going and going.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.920]   And if you look at, there's some great websites out there that rate charities.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.480]   Like I always go and look at the charity navigators.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.280]   One of them that tells you like the expense ratio, like conservation
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   international was an a plus plus in every category.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.120]   So you felt confident giving that money to this.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.320]   I just want to know who was the guy or gal that set this deal with American.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.080]   What kind of Christmas party did conservation international have after
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.960]   probably getting millions of dollars of donations over the course of a
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.840]   couple of days, like good job over there.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.520]   Who lost out in that?
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.040]   Like, is this American losing money?
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.360]   No, there's some really great insights into this deal.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.840]   Specifically by my buddy, Gary left at view from the wing who wrote several
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.320]   articles over who was funding this.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.080]   What basically happens is the charity paid none of it because they wouldn't
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.400]   agree to be in these portals if they were taking a lump of it, but it basically
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.800]   came down to mastercard funding it because this was done through the mastercard
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.840]   website called simply miles where you link a card and anytime you use it at a
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.040]   participating merchant, you get bonus miles, great details of the math.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.560]   How basically nobody lost to believe it or not in the way that this works again,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.320]   because of tax write-offs and the pricing that you can have when you control it in
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.080]   the way that you can carry that liability of these miles.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.480]   And while we think it's millions and millions of miles is a big deal from
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.320]   these promotions, the grand scheme of things, the amount of miles that were
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.280]   given out on this based on how many miles are outstanding in the American
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.520]   books was inconsequential.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.200]   And then if you ever want to go into loyalty accounting, who it is a complex
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.360]   and a rather amazing space about how they can defer the liability of these
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.160]   unredeemed miles to where nobody took a hit for this happening in the charity.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.760]   One really fascinating stuff.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.040]   Wow.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.520]   Okay.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.440]   So I'm going to link to that Gary's article.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.640]   What fantastic blog at the end, we'll recap some of the favorite people you
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.480]   follow in blogs, but that's all hotel loyalty.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.360]   I think a big thing that everyone listening here wants to talk about is
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.000]   credit cards.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.040]   So I kind of want to talk about the space cause we'll get to built, but a lot of
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.080]   crazy things have been happening in credit cards in the last few years.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.120]   And it feels like all of the issuers, the big issuers or the big four, at least
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.720]   are merging to the same place.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.240]   And then city is just like, went on the side.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.480]   I don't know.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.400]   I don't know what to say.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.320]   Wilting on the side.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.440]   Where do you think we're at?
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.320]   It seems like the average person that used to collect five or six cards now
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.200]   has three priority past memberships could buy global entry for their entire family.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.560]   I'm curious what you think of the state of cards.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.480]   And one way, I think it's a race to the bottom.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.360]   You cannot have the customer acquisition costs that these cards are now having
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.680]   and expect to make money because the demographic that's getting these cards
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.000]   in large part, they're not going to revolve, meaning they're not going to
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.880]   pay 25 to 30% interest and you're just getting the interchange off of them.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.160]   So looking at recent examples of the capital one venture X, you cannot go in
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.960]   an airport, turn on a sport show or look at commercials right now without seeing
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.720]   the same, it was like what in the Rose bowl, capital one venture X.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.960]   I was in the airports this weekend.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   I see it.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.200]   That's on top of giving people a hundred thousand venture miles, which costs
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.440]   capital one money on top of a $200 vacation rental credit on top of paying
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.800]   blogs and content creators, who knows how much per card approval.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.480]   So with all of that marketing, tangible signup benefits and everything like the
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.640]   quick numbers show you they're over $2,000 per customer acquisition costs.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.920]   I don't know how they make that back.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.000]   I really don't.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.600]   And I think it's the, the, the, uh, chase Sapphire reserve reincarnated.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.600]   When that thing came out in 2016, it was the greatest thing since sliced bread,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.440]   everybody had to have it, but then that first report came out that showed how
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.680]   much money chase loss on the customer acquisition costs and how far it like
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.720]   to the magnitude of 20 X, what they expected to lose, to get these customers.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.320]   And what do we see now, five years later, that car is being moonlighted
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.240]   because it's losing a ridiculous amount of money customers are not revolving.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.960]   And we've seen the value propositions of the chase Sapphire prefer move to be
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.160]   arguably better for $95 annual fee, rather than $550, which is why I really
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.080]   scratched my head when I see capital one, come out with this and go great for the
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.920]   consumers, don't get me wrong, like my wife and I both picked this thing up and
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.120]   now we have hundreds of thousands of venture miles, but they're not making any
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.320]   money.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.960]   So why wouldn't they take all of these efforts and make the venture card, which
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.880]   is a wonderful card for, especially for people who just don't want anything
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.200]   complicated and want to get miles and all the great improvements capital ones made
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.160]   with their loyalty program and replay the chase Sapphire reserve playbook, where
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.920]   you go awesome, but just make the venture card better, not do this luxury card
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   thing to your point that like, I don't need another priority pass membership.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.440]   I don't need another global entry deal.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.360]   What are we doing here?
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.600]   Is it because FOMO is because you just have to have something out there as a
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.080]   loss leader to get new customers.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.880]   So what do you think, man?
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.760]   Like why, why, why throw this out?
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   And no, you're probably not going to make money.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.880]   Yeah, I guess my perspective is that if I look at all these cards and I talk to
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.360]   people, I know everyone seems to have come to the terms that they're going to
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.200]   hold a card that has a 500 ish dollar annual fee.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.640]   And because capital one didn't have one, it was kind of like, well, it doesn't
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.160]   make sense.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.000]   Like even, even if the extra incremental perks for the card aren't worth the extra
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.120]   fee, it just feels to me like it's never felt like capital one had a card worth
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.960]   holding and what was funny.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.520]   So then VentureX comes out, huge signup bonuses.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.760]   I get one, my wife gets one.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.880]   I tell my sister to get one.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.120]   And my sister's not thinking about the bonuses as much as "Is this a card I'll
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.720]   spend on?"
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.480]   And she looks at the card and she's like, "Well, it seems like the Venture card's
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.640]   just as good.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.240]   Like, I don't...
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.680]   There's three lounges.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.000]   I've already got priority pass."
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.360]   So I was looking at it and I was like, "Man, I guess it was just like it convinced
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.080]   me to sign up for the huge bonus.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.600]   But I see, I feel like it's gonna be hard at the end of the year to not consider
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.920]   downgrading to just have the Venture card for, for less, but assuming they allow
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.960]   downgrading, I have a card.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.040]   No, I agree.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.680]   Like, why would you hold a VentureX long-term over the Venture card?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.440]   I don't, I don't know.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.600]   The bonus earnings, the portal grade, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.400]   But overall it's the competition of massive signup bonuses.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.440]   So we've seen American Express the last six months has just let the wheels off and
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.520]   been like with the resi and small business offer, if you sign up for the right referral
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.000]   Platinum card at the right time, you could be earning like 18X on almost all spent.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.600]   Like 18 points per dollar on your American Express Platinum card.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:09.200]   And people are earning millions of points.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.280]   Like I don't, how are we making money on this folks?
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.560]   I just don't understand this.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.080]   And is it because the executives in charge now, by the time the chickens
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.360]   come home to roost are not going to be in that position anymore.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.600]   They're just being lauded by how many new customer accounts are driving right now,
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.040]   which is a huge key metric for any bank executive is how many new accounts have
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.840]   you got, like, I don't know, it's pure speculation, this eventually has to all
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.520]   be redeemed at a real cost and I'm not sure what the banks are doing, how long
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.280]   this is sustainable, or if it's just one of those, like it's become so much money
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.000]   that it's funny money and we can figure out other metrics and KPIs to show success
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.560]   of this in market, how much market share we gained versus real dollars and cents
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.080]   that are lost.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.040]   So it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.320]   It doesn't make sense to a lot of my colleagues.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.920]   Now we're here at built as we design a credit card and a rewards program,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   because what we want to do is be sustainable.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.480]   And the stuff I see now just, just isn't unless there's some magic key
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.240]   that I don't know about.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.400]   I want to get to built, but I'm going to get annihilated by people writing in.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   If I don't go back and say, can you walk through this 18X?
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.840]   Cause that's something that I think some people I know are going to ask me if I
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.760]   don't ask that question.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.680]   Yeah, there was, there was a MX platinum offer that came out from resi, like
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.120]   the table, the reserve, we can make a reservation at a restaurant with a
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.320]   partnership that said, Hey, sign up for the platinum card, get 125,000
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.000]   membership rewards after the 5,000 and spend plus get 10 X points at all
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.720]   restaurants worldwide and Oh, by the way, get eight X at any small business.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.440]   So if your small business is also a restaurant, 18 X, you can also go on
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.320]   the small business website finder that MX has, and probably a lot of the places
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.520]   that you shop all the time, don't realize that they're small businesses and
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.920]   they're throwing like huge offers at you to go and spend there as well as
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.960]   statement credits as well as MX offers to go and shop it.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.560]   And it was just.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   Absolutely wild.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.640]   You can just hit the Google machine, type in MX, platinum resi, small
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.320]   business, and you'll number one, have FOMO because you missed out.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.480]   It's just, and then to my point, when I read these things go, who
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.080]   in the world is funding, who in the world is funding 18X like this stuff.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.520]   And is that still going on?
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.680]   It's not sadly, um, about two weeks ago.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.720]   It's gone, but a great story.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.560]   I got to share about my friend Nick Reyes over at a frequent miler.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.840]   He's been trying to buy a brand new car on a credit card, left my dealership
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.320]   to find the entire credit card.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.720]   I was able to do this in 2015.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.520]   He was very upset that he wasn't able to, so he was going to one up me.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.840]   And sure enough, he did.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   He had an MX platinum card that had a retention offer, a signup bonus
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.320]   offer, and a small business offer.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.640]   And he ended up getting over a half million Amex points by putting his
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.880]   entire new minivan on his MX platinum card, but two weeks ago.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.280]   And, and it's because he was able to stack all these offers.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.160]   And in my mind, I go, the dealership just paid three to 4% to American express.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.520]   American express just paid out 500,000 points.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.160]   Like everybody loses in, in the consumer wins big.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.560]   So how is this ecosystem sustainable?
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.640]   I really don't know, but it's amazing what goes on.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.240]   But as long as it's out there, take advantage of the big signup bonuses,
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.920]   take advantage of some of these offers.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.280]   And I assume by offers you mean you mean a lot of the offers that are in the portals
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.120]   when you log in and you, you view those, the offers that are add to
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.440]   card or there are other offers.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.080]   There's there's MX off.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.240]   There's, um, MX American express specifically comes out with these
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.400]   limited time, like dining credits to head last year, you get Uber
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.320]   credits to come on your platinum card.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.360]   It seems like you need a spreadsheet to keep up with all of these things.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.540]   City has mastercard merchant offers.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.160]   Now Chase has offers now bank of America does that says, Hey,
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   chop at this store, you spend 20 bucks and we'll give you either bonus
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.760]   miles or we'll give you 10 bucks back.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.600]   And then what you do is you stack all of these together.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.680]   And like, I'm going into the weeds right now.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.740]   People, but I just want to wet the appetite a little bit to know there's a
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.000]   better way to do what you're doing.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.320]   Most likely if, if you want to earn American airline status, for example,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.360]   when you have a master card, say you want to buy some wine, there's some
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.920]   great wine offers out there from wine clubs, wine, ink, wink, w I N C.com.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.680]   They have city merchant offers.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.960]   They're going to give you bonus America miles from simple miles.com.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.240]   And then you can shop through the advantage shopping portal.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.520]   And you can essentially get by stacking these three deals together, like
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.600]   statement credit, bonus miles and wine show up at your door for either
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.480]   nothing or very little out of pocket.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.920]   And Oh, by the way, you're earning American airline status
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.000]   on that as of this year.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.160]   And it's become like fun.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.480]   Yes.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.760]   How, what can I do to get, like, I want to get some wine for Valentine's
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.560]   day next week as a recording this, like I went ahead and ordered four
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.840]   bottles of wine from wink, got 2,500 American miles, and then the statement
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.080]   credit from city that made it cost a dollar 50 for four bottles of wine to
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.560]   show up great, happy Valentine's day.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:46.880]   Wife.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.120]   Hope she's not listening.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:56.440]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.400]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.600]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.680]   have too many manual processes.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.480]   And there's no one source of truth.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.120]   One 37,000.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.640]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.040]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.560]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.120]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more 25.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.240]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.080]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.800]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.400]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.680]   system with one source of truth, manage risk, get reliable

[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.040]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.960]   the companies I've run makes everything so much better.

[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.920]   Allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.720]   You all know, I love credit card points.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.360]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.320]   my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.480]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.120]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.720]   purchase.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.200]   You can also load it on your partner's phone so they always know the best cards
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:43.760]   to use.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.720]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.920]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.000]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.800]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.880]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.360]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.200]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.120]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well, but if you
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.680]   want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.040]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.960]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.400]   Have you played around with Card Pointers?
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.280]   It's an app and a Chrome extension.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.120]   I have not.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.360]   I have not heard of Card Pointers.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.800]   So Card Pointers launched this app and they also have a Chrome extension.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.480]   And similar to if anyone's ever had one of the Rakuten or Shopping Portal Chrome
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.440]   extensions, they do this for the offers.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.200]   So you're on a website and they do two things.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.520]   One, they pop up and say, "Hey, if you're going to buy something here, this is the
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.200]   card to use."
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.000]   So you can go in and say, "I have a Platinum, a Venture X, Chase Reserve,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.320]   whatever."
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.080]   And then they'll say, "Hey, if you're going to check out on this website, make
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.560]   sure to use this card for the most points."
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.840]   But what they also do is say, "Hey, before you check out, Amex has an offer for this
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.200]   merchant.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.720]   So make sure you go to the Amex site and you load that offer in there."
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.000]   So I've been playing around with the app.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.760]   Yeah, I have no relationship.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.560]   The founder emailed me and was like, "Hey, thanks for mentioning us."
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.000]   I don't get anything for mentioning them.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.160]   But these offers change so frequently on the card sites that if you don't have
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   something to remind you, you just have to open up Amex and Chase and everything
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.120]   every morning and look.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.080]   Two things to jump back to card stuff you mentioned.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.640]   You said they're moonlighting the Chase Reserve.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.760]   Do you think that that card goes away or loses all of its luster?
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.280]   Because I think a lot of people listening, that's their kind of go-to card.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   I think people need to reevaluate.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.800]   The value prop of the Chase Sapphire Preferred for, again, $450 less annual
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.040]   fee, you're basically earning the same points.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.320]   And then the additional benefits of the CSR where people are like, "Oh, I can
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.440]   redeem for 1.5 cents instead of 1.25 cents."
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.520]   But are you redeeming 750,000 points at that marginal quarter to make the
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.360]   annual fee $450 annual fee up?
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.200]   They're like, "Oh no, I'm not."
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.520]   I'm like, "You don't need the CSR."
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   I don't think the card goes away.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.480]   I just think there's less and less incentive to hold it.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.720]   And the sign-up bonus is never going to be 100,000 again.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.280]   And they're going to do everything they can to their other products
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.640]   to drive people away from it.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.400]   Which is, again, it was the gold standard of the credit card
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.680]   industry five years ago.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.520]   So it's really interesting to see that happen to the product.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.640]   But I just want people to take a hard look at why you're going to
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.920]   pay the annual fee for another year.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.600]   I feel like Amex is in a similar boat where I find myself telling
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.080]   people, "Look, the Amex Platinum has a bunch of perks, and if the
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.680]   perks are worth the annual fee, maybe it's worth it."
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.240]   Most of the time, the reason I recommend the Platinum is because
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.200]   they're getting $150,000 or some ridiculous sign-up bonus.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.000]   But when I think about what I spend my money on, the Amex Gold is
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.520]   kind of like, it's a trend now, is that all these card issuers launch
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.560]   these super premium cards with huge sign-up bonuses, but the card
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.640]   that most people probably should be using more regularly is their cheaper card.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.080]   Because after they issue all those points, they can't afford to keep
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.520]   paying you points in bonus categories.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.000]   But yeah, $6.95 for the Platinum card, the vast majority of people, I would
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.080]   argue, who hold that don't need to.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.000]   And it's just become incredibly frustrating to use the benefits or what's
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.840]   now going around as the Amex Coupon Booklet, just to try and keep up with
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   everything, and then when you come out on the same day with a SoulCycle
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.040]   offer and Walmart Plus, you're like, "These are very different American
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.760]   demographics.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.320]   Who are we going after here, folks?
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.800]   Like, who is this card for?
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   Because I don't know anymore."
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   And it's wild.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.520]   For me, the Amex Platinum, it's the Coupon Booklet, and it makes
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.760]   sense if you book a lot of flights.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.360]   If you travel, great.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.200]   I don't know where you're getting 5X on flights that you can book on the
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.760]   airline's website and not have to book through a portal, but outside of that,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.000]   you've got to really work hard.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.720]   I've got to work hard.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.800]   I'm like, "What am I going to buy at Saks before the end of the year?
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.280]   I've got to spend my $50."
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.880]   And I try to justify that those $50 are worth $50, but otherwise, I'm not
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.320]   actually buying this fancy hand soap or whatever it is on the list this year.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.560]   And the last thing, and then I want to jump to Bilt, is Citi.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.880]   All these conversations I'm having now are Cap One, they're Amex, they're Chase.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.520]   They're now including Bilt.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.080]   Like, is Citi out of the game?
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.400]   Are they trying to get in the game?
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.560]   Citi's struggled a long time with who they are.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.240]   Thank you points are a great currency.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.080]   Their big struggle is that they don't have any domestic transfer partners.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.400]   So if you want to fly domestically, it's a problem, which is, I think, Capital One's
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.160]   biggest knock right now for everything great they've done.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.880]   They still don't have a domestic transfer partner.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.640]   But thank you points as they stand on their own are a great currency.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.840]   All the ancillaries of dealing with Citi are my problem.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.400]   So if you've got new Citi cards about the fraud alert shenanigans that
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.440]   happened and the endless loop of trying to get out of these fraud alert
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.120]   shenanigans, Citi IT really struggles.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.600]   And then they decimated the Citi Prestige, which was an amazing card four or five
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.800]   years ago, down to a shell of its former self and not even open for applications
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.200]   anymore.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.640]   I don't think anybody should be ignoring Citi, Citi Double Cash or any two Citi
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.320]   thank you points on every dollar is great that you can combine with the big
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.080]   signup bonus of the Citi Premier, which has nice bonus categories.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.360]   I think it's great, but sometimes Citi just absolutely frustrates you from the
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.120]   customer experience that you don't want to mess with them anymore, which is what
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.040]   happened to me and my wife.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   I just endless fraud alerts trying to get out of it.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.680]   They're like, you have to give us the chase login and your chase account in
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.280]   order for us to verify you on Citi.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.040]   It's a real story.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.280]   And it's a real thing that they do.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   And then you like think it's all cleared up and then you go and swipe the card
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.800]   declined fraud alert, call us.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.000]   And you're just like, okay, I'm done.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.240]   I think it's, it's just absolutely maddening from a customer perspective
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:43.960]   sometime to use it.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.640]   But, you know, I keep Citi thank you points in the bank account and sitting
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.880]   around just in case they have access to a few programs that nobody else does.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.600]   They just really got to clean up that user experience and get them excited
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.920]   again, and again, decide who are their cards for and what do they want to be.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.960]   Yep.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.720]   That makes sense.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.520]   So I want to talk about built, right?
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.160]   You guys have basically, you spent the last, you know, decade in this industry
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.120]   trying to figure out how it all works and reporting and from every angle, and now
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.560]   you're actually on the ground building a new card and thinking about it with all
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.360]   that perspective.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.760]   So I touched on it briefly, right?
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.200]   We talked about in a past episode, I think it was Brian Kelly.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.720]   He mentioned built, we talked about how it earns points on rent, but maybe give a
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.920]   quick recap of, you know, what the card does and kind of who it's for.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.960]   So built rewards is a standalone loyalty program.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.080]   Anybody can participate in the built rewards loyalty program.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.720]   If you live in the built rewards Alliance.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.880]   So we've gone out and partnered with the largest real estate companies in the
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.160]   world.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   We have 2 million apartments in the United States.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.800]   Now that are in the built rewards Alliance.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   If you download our app and pay your landlord through our app, and they're all
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.360]   directly integrated with this, we give you 250 points a month, cost nothing.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.200]   There's no fees.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.120]   We just want to give you something where you previously got nothing.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:58.840]   Need the card.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.000]   That's just the loyalty program.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.360]   And what's happening is, and why the landlords and real estate people are so
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.080]   excited is it's really expensive in many markets to find new qualified
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.600]   tenants or to retain tenants.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.560]   There's been no marketing lever that they can pull to say, resign a lease with
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.640]   us, except for giving cash out of their pockets.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.600]   And it's paying a broker a month's rent, a month and a half rent to
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.720]   go and find a new tenant.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.240]   Now they can issue built points.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.200]   So if you're saying 250 points, isn't a lot like that's not really going to get
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.720]   me anything.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.040]   I'll tell you what the points are worth in a little bit, but the landlords can
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.720]   say, Hey, if you resign this lease, here's 20,000 points.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.680]   If you refer a friend to this building, we'll give you 20,000 points or
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.280]   whatever the landlord wants to issue.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.400]   If they have really want to attract somebody 50,000 bill points to come
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.320]   and sign a lease, sorry, you had a maintenance issue.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.400]   We had no way to make that right now.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.120]   We're going to issue you 5,000 points and say, we're sorry that, you know,
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.360]   something in your apartment broke.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.680]   And the landlords are like, Holy smokes, this is great.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.960]   This is a universal loyalty program to attract and retain residents.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.480]   We're all in to the point that some of them are now investors with us.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.360]   But on top of that, we wanted to supersize earning ability and we
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.200]   created the built mastercard and this is a no annual fee card open to soon
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.160]   to be open to anybody in the United States.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.240]   We've had it on a wait list for now, while we really perfect the product
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.840]   that's been out for less than a year.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.360]   But very soon, almost everybody in the United States will be able to
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.120]   apply for the built rewards card.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.360]   No annual fee card earns one X points on rent.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.280]   No matter where you live in the country, any landlord, you can pay.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.400]   You can pay in the built rewards app and we will mail your
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.800]   landlord, a physical check.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.320]   Now you can use your built rewards, mastercard as an
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.000]   ACH and pay your landlord.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.400]   Again, any landlord, any portal, rent cafe, click, pay all these things.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.080]   We'll give you a routing and checking account number that will
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.160]   charge to your bill card earn one X points on rent, two X points on
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.880]   travel and three X points on dining.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.000]   And it's a world elite card with all kinds of crazy benefits that are
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.240]   really quite absurd for a no fee card.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.560]   But in the end, we want to give people something where
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.680]   previously they got nothing.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.120]   I don't know how many people ask you, can they pay their rent with a
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.680]   credit card and you're like, yeah, but the fee's going to, you know,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.200]   wipe away any value that you get.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.680]   Well, I mean, now it's possible.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.360]   So we're really excited about what we've done.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.080]   I've gotten that question plenty of times.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.120]   And the answer is always, no, it's never worth it until now.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.320]   So card makes total sense.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.080]   You pay rent, you should have the card.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.520]   What about people who don't pay rent?
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.720]   What about people who own their home?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.640]   I know a lot of people listening own homes.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.600]   And I get asked 3,748.5 times a day.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.880]   Can I pay my mortgage with this?
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.320]   And the answer so far is not yet.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.360]   There's 109 million renters in the United States, and that is more than enough
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.320]   customers to try and go after for right now.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.640]   But I, but I want to let everybody know that we've heard the feedback loud and
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.280]   clear, and we would love to make that happen.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.040]   And it's something we talk about regularly, but for now, just your
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.240]   personal rent that you can pay, you know, zero one, two, three value
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.160]   proposition is the same as the Chase Sapphire preferred that gives one X
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.840]   points and I'll spend two X on travel and three X on dining, but they charge
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.960]   a $95 annual fee and we have the same and some different slash better
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.360]   transfer partners than they do.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.840]   So to everybody that says the Chase Sapphire preferred is my go-to card.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.440]   It's a great, it's a great card, but why would you not go to our card?
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.240]   But it's no annual fee.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.440]   You're in the same amount of points and have access to American
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.200]   Airlines as a transfer partner.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.360]   And it's a good conversation to get back and forth into.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.640]   My motto has really been, we're going to wear you down.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.440]   When we first came out in June, we continue to iterate and make
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.600]   the program better and better.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.120]   I want to hear all the feedback.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.040]   I listen all the time.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.200]   I keep my head to the ground with the formal world.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.160]   I was in to hear what people are saying and the arguments
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.360]   for and against the bill card.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.200]   And we're constantly iterating and we're coming out with some really
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.680]   exciting new things over the next couple of months that it's going
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.200]   to be like resistance is futile.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   Like eventually the quiz is going to be like, okay, like they've worn me down.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.640]   Like I gotta be a part of this and have access to all the great
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.240]   things that the, that the card's doing.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.840]   And you mentioned American, which I think is interesting because I've
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.360]   always had this attitude of, I want to make sure I have points everywhere,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.280]   because if I want to take a trip in a certain place, I want to be able to do it.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.360]   And American's been the hardest to earn points on, in my opinion.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.160]   But there used to be these great offers for American cards.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.280]   And I remember it used to be able to sign up for all three in one day
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.880]   and not, and only get one credit check gone, gone.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.960]   I think are those days.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.360]   And, and then right now with super low interest rates, I've used
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.440]   Basque bank to put some money in so that I earned a few American
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.640]   airlines points each month.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.080]   But this is interesting because I think the lead value prop might
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.400]   turn some people away for, I don't have rent.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.600]   It is a place where if you want for no annual fee to start earning some
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.400]   points that you can get into American, that's great, but where else can you use.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.200]   So we have seven airline, uh, transfer partners, all one to one.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.800]   So American aeroplane, Hawaiian airlines, Virgin points, Turkish miles
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.200]   and smiles and Emirates skywards, uh, as well as flying blue and then two hotel
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.160]   partners, we have all three alliances covered plus Emirates, which is not
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.320]   an Alliance, but it has a pretty, uh, expansive and global network.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.480]   And then between IHG and high, it's pretty much anywhere you go in the world.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.440]   You could use bill points to book a free hotel night.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.480]   So really exciting list of transfer partners and I'm not going to spill any
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.080]   beans, but I'll just let you know, we're never done with that list and we'll,
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.200]   we'll continue working to try and make it, make it more robust and more exciting.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.280]   So you, you mentioned earlier, one of the problems with all these card issuers is
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.640]   that they're doing completely unsustainable things and until the bill card, paying
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.960]   rent with a credit card, any landlord that offered that would just be losing money.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.400]   And, and as a consumer using sites like plastic, which would go pay your rent
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.280]   and, and then, you know, you're paying a fee.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.040]   So how is this sustainable?
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   Yeah, everybody, everybody asks us, how are you making money?
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.640]   So, um, let's think about all the different revenue streams that we have.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.840]   Number one, we have a credit card, which means we get the interchange.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.560]   Every time you swipe it, people pay interchange for that card.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.920]   And that's how card issuers make money.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.800]   Second, we have our real estate people that are buying bill points to issue
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.040]   to new current prospective residents.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.440]   So it's landlord funded loyalty program on top of interchange.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.320]   And then the aspirational award for us is you can actually redeem bill
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.360]   points for the down payment on a house.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.080]   We can make homeownership a reality for renters.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.080]   And we do that not only by being able to use points for the covering
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.400]   and down payment on mortgage, but we also report all of your on-time rent
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.800]   payments to all three credit bureaus, which every landlord in the country can
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.440]   do now, but 98% do not because what do they care?
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.520]   There's nothing in it for them.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.240]   And that's going to increase your credit score significantly, which
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.040]   makes, uh, you qualify for a much more favorable mortgage and saves you
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.280]   thousands over the course of buying a home.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.800]   Um, and with that comes the ability to be a mortgage originator and the
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.680]   mortgage origination business is huge and a very, um, profitable business
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.280]   to be in if you do it correctly.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.680]   So between the interchange, between being a mortgage originator and between
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.960]   landlords funding the program, this is very sustainable and it's one of the
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.200]   first questions I had for our founder, when I went and met him and heard about
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.960]   this is like, I want to be something that's part of a sustainable business.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.320]   I don't want to be hopping businesses in six months and I don't want to be on
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.840]   the current VC hamster wheel of show growth at all costs, despite if you're
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.760]   losing millions of dollars, you just need to show growth to get to the next
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.200]   round of funding, like I just didn't want to be a part of that personally.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.240]   We did one round of fundraising last year.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.160]   We might do another, but we don't necessarily have to.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.400]   That's a sustainable business model and we're excited about it.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.080]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.800]   is actually so good for you.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.560]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.200]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.440]   ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.920]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:36.960]   leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.840]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.080]   minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.440]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.200]   in pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.600]   seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.840]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.560]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.680]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.320]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.320]   backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.040]   sugar, and more, and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.720]   polyphenols than all other teas in the world, but you don't even have to
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.720]   take my word or do any research because Peak offers free US shipping, free
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.880]   returns, and a money backed guarantee.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:36.080]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:42.760]   12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.320]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:55.120]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.400]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.000]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.080]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.560]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.160]   their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.880]   cost of going out for coffee.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.080]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.880]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.320]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.800]   it, and over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:38.480]   this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.000]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.360]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.520]   you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.120]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.640]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.680]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.520]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.200]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners,
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.480]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.920]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   So one of the things you guys do that I think is fascinating is I've never seen
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:28.040]   a bit of content from Amex or Chase or Capital One saying, "Hey, here's how to
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.480]   get the most value out of these points."
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.960]   I feel like I'm always being pushed to use them in the worst way as possible.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   "Hey, you can use your points for this terrible redemption, buy gift cards
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.240]   online," but they're never walking you through how to transfer
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.440]   your points to other airlines.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.880]   And I've seen a couple of videos you put out saying, "Hey, let me walk you
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.040]   through how you could use your points to get to Europe for almost nothing."
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.160]   That's one example, but I'd love if you can share how should people do this?
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.360]   What is the advice you give to your cardholders on how to maximize points
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.000]   with so many transfer partners that the average person doesn't want to log
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.880]   onto all seven sites and say, "Okay, what's it cost if I use this person
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.560]   or this airline, or if I transfer to Flying Blue, then I book on Delta?"
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.440]   It's a tough game that I used to tell people you could sign up for all these
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.880]   paid services, or you can go one by one.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.400]   Is there an easy answer that you have for people?
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:23.680]   The easy answer is unfortunately no, but we're trying hard.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.120]   So we've done a couple of things like you mentioned.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.080]   If you go into our app, there's a flights tab where I've curated a bunch of
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.120]   content that's separated out by airline.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.040]   It says, if you want to fly this airline, whether it's a partner of ours or not,
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   click on that tile that we have in our app.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.760]   And I've very quickly with screenshots showing you how to fly it.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.840]   So JetBlue is not a transfer partner of ours, but you can fly in
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.240]   with BuiltPoints through Emirates.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.560]   If you want to fly JetBlue, click on the JetBlue tile and very
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.760]   quickly, I tell you how to do that.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.920]   The next thing we've done is we have a real-time award search functionality
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.040]   in the BuiltRewards app now.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.160]   Right now we have American and AeroPlan on it.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.680]   So if you search any route in the world, it will instantly show you
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.040]   both AeroPlan and American results.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.840]   All you have to do is tab between them in the app and we're working hard to get
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.400]   our other partners involved in that.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.640]   So that's an easy way to do one search and see at least Star Alliance and One
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.000]   World availability as quick as you can.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.320]   But the end results of all of this and basically everything we've talked
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.360]   about today is if you want something really good, it's going to
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.320]   take a little bit of effort.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.880]   And what my job is, and one of them is to make that effort minimal, but
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.640]   it is going to take some effort.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.960]   Um, so through the content, through the videos that we're putting out and
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.600]   through this new real-time award availability search, we feel like
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.360]   we're on the right path and again, for being less than a year old.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   And as you said, nobody other, nobody else is trying to educate their
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.160]   members on how to maximize points.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.880]   We feel like we're in a good spot and we're on the right path to making it easy.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.520]   And can people do that in your app and search American and AeroPlan
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.080]   availability if they don't have the card?
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   Is that something anyone can do?
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.800]   Again, anybody can download the BuiltRewards app and read all of our
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.040]   content, but you will have to join in order to get the logged in experience.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:56.240]   But all of the content and that search feature is available if you're not logged
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.800]   in and you haven't created an account.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.360]   So we just want to be a resource.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.880]   So whether you're like, I'm not a renter, but this sounds interesting,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.960]   or I want to learn how to use these programs, like download the BuiltRewards
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.640]   app and take a look at all the content and tools that we've created there.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.360]   And you've been in this space a long time outside of the BuiltRewards app.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.880]   If someone comes to you and says, "God, I got all these Amex and Chase points."
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.400]   What's your advice to them on how to, how to not get stuck redeeming
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.720]   them at, at terrible valuations?
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.240]   Yeah, there's some new technology coming out.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:25.800]   This one that you, you brought it out to me, card pointers.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   I feel like there, there are dozens of people out there making great
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.480]   products to make all of this simpler.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:36.000]   Um, some of the ones I'd recommend, the card curator app is a great one
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.040]   that'll guide you in how to do these points in a simple process.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.720]   Max rewards is another product out there.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.440]   That's helping folks make this simpler.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.880]   And then there's some new technology not released yet that I'm excited
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.280]   about probably in the next six months.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.480]   That will be public facing.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.800]   That will basically tell you in real time, Hey, this is how you can use your
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.040]   points to go where you want to go.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.480]   And you just tell them what points you have.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.080]   So the easy answer is to go check out some of these
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.480]   technologies that I've just mentioned.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:03.080]   Um, the hard answer is go to Google and search best way to use X points.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   And I'm sure the points guy article that maybe I wrote will be at the top of the
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:12.040]   search results, uh, giving you step-by-step breakdown, but again, Probably just like
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.080]   you, when you have friends and family ask you these questions and you try
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.280]   and make it as simple as possible.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.000]   You can tell pretty quick if their eyes glass over in three seconds, you're
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.020]   like, I'm going to go ahead and stop.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.400]   Or some people they light up and they go, wait, there really is something here.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.200]   This is not a multi-level marketing scheme.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.120]   Like this is something I can get excited about.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.720]   I think that's a lot of people listening here.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.000]   Hey everybody.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.120]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with point dot me, my
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:38.760]   favorite award search tool to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.440]   first month of their standard plan.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:47.120]   If you go to all the hacks.com/point me and use the promo code hacks again,
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   all the hacks.com/P O I N T M E, or find the link in the show notes.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.680]   So definitely take advantage of that.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   If you're planning a trip with points, do you have, you know,
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.280]   favorite redemptions right now?
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.560]   Things that, you know, despite all the devaluations and dynamic pricing that
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.480]   are just the sweet spots and in the award charts, yeah, a hundred percent
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.360]   Turkish miles and smiles to fly United specifically to Hawaii for 7,500 miles.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.520]   That's 7,500 bill points or city.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:16.800]   Thank you.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.000]   Points transferred to Turkish.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.560]   You can go to Hawaii and then you can fly Turkish themselves, which is an
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.880]   amazing product to Istanbul, like 33,000 points in business class from the East
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.200]   coast to Turkey, out of all their destinations, if you haven't slept on
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.080]   the Turkish miles and smiles program, now's the time to wake up and either
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.800]   fly United or fly Turkish with it.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.000]   Beyond that American web specials, the Delta flash sales.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.240]   If you don't have that page bookmarked that they update all the time, just
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:45.680]   really great domestic and international deals all the time, probably be the
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.840]   top three that I would tell folks that are most relevant that they need to check out.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.240]   Any good deals on Emirates for people who have been buying
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.000]   that Emirates first-class experience.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.840]   Back in the days of when Alaska charged very reasonable amounts of
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.720]   miles to fly them, it was a lot easier.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.360]   Now it's just going to cost you a lot to skywards credit.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.320]   They eliminated fuel surcharges, which took the program out of complete
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.400]   irrelevancy to now very relevant program.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.200]   If you want to do Emirates first-class taking their fifth freedoms from Newark
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.440]   and JFK to Milan and Athens, it's going to be your best bet to do that under
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.600]   200,000, uh, skywards miles, uh, or transfer from chase or transfer from
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.640]   MX or transfer from built to make that round trip, um, it's going to be your
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.360]   best bets.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.240]   The other only thing I'll say about that is sometimes quantities can be a
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.960]   little bit better of a deal, charge a little bit fewer points, and you can
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.200]   transfer city over to Qantas and take advantage of that.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.320]   All right.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.840]   And any best redemption stories from your end?
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.960]   I got a lot.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:44.720]   My very first trip, believe it or not, 2010, when United has favorable award
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.800]   routing rules that we call stopovers and open jaws, my wife and I flew around the
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.160]   world in business and first-class for 110,000 United miles by piecing together
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.400]   all of their, again, the routing rules.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.960]   We did Seattle to Hawaii, to Tokyo, to Seoul, to Frankfurt, and then back to
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.040]   Seattle and Lufthansa first-class and United business class in Asia and a
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.240]   first-class, and it was just fantastic.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.480]   Yes.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.240]   And what, what you're talking about for anyone who doesn't know, a lot of
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:18.280]   airlines have these rules where if you want to fly, you can add a stopover or
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.520]   you can change where you're going to and coming from.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.400]   So you could book instead of a round trip ticket from San Francisco to
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.200]   Frankfurt and back, you could go to Frankfurt and fly back from Milan, or
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.680]   you can stop over on your way there.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.160]   And sometimes you can, not every airline still has these, you know, kind of great
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:38.680]   rules, but some of them do still, I don't know if you remember which ones do now,
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.080]   but you can still take advantage of them.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.520]   You can add stopovers to an airplane ticket for 5,000 airplane points.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.000]   Airplane is their newly redesigned.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.440]   One of those programs that's headed in the right direction and just did a
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.200]   fantastic job in the redesign.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.320]   If you're not familiar with the ins and outs, we're familiar at all with
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.120]   airplane, please go read up on that.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.680]   Great articles out there explaining how you can get just tons of value by seeing
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.280]   multiple destinations on one ticket by using stopovers and open draws.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.000]   It's fantastic.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.800]   And they're transfer partners of you got chase and built and American express.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.720]   So a lot of options to get in there.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.680]   A lot of people always tell me, gosh, Amex doesn't go to United.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.640]   And I like to fly United and I'm like, Ooh, they go to aeroplane.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.600]   They got United inventory.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.640]   So don't forget that if you have a card that has access to an
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.480]   Alliance, it's not always perfect.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.080]   Sometimes you might rather have American points than British airways points, but
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.120]   you can use BA to book on American.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.760]   And sometimes for, I don't know if it's still the case, but BA used to be so
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.440]   good for these short flights, but if the availability is there, it's still a great
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.320]   deal, a hundred percent.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.040]   Cool.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.600]   Quick few things before we go travel hacks, like outside of award booking,
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.640]   you've been to dozens of countries.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.840]   I don't, I don't know how big the list is at this point, but what have you picked
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.200]   up both on the traveling, when you get to places, what are your favorite hacks?
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.240]   Yeah, it all pretty much revolves around the practical is what I like to tell
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.840]   people because there are all kinds of advanced things I get in the weeds, but
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   the practical things of like, how do I get cash?
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:08.320]   Where do I do the exchange with the getting screwed on the exchange rate?
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.440]   So I'll tell you what to do.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.800]   I have a USA checking account.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   You can, if you don't qualify for USA through military, you can use the Schwab.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:19.360]   I go to a bank ATM in the country and pull out cash in the local currency.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.440]   And that way it uses my bank's exchange rate, which is going to be fair.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.040]   And it avoids all the shenanigans of exchanging cash at a desk or
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.200]   with one of these airport folks.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.960]   And I do not use the bank or the ATM at the airport.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.200]   I always go to the hotel and then find the most local or closest ATM, use
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.120]   my ATM card and pull out cash there.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.480]   It's the best way to get cash.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.720]   The second practical travel hack or piece of advice is a
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.080]   dynamic currency conversion, DCC.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.320]   This occurs when you go to check out of your hotel in a foreign country.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.120]   And it says, Hey, do you want to use us dollars?
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   Or do you want to use our local currency?
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.880]   And most Americans go, Oh, sweet.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.720]   I'll just do dollars.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.000]   Cause I know how much that is.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:54.960]   Don't do that.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.560]   Always charge in local currency, because what they do is they use
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.920]   a very unfavorable exchange rate.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.840]   They end up charging you in the local currency anyways, and then your
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.480]   bank exchange rate gets you again.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.560]   So they make like on the order of magnitude of 10% worse than what
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.200]   the actual market exchange rate is.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.520]   So always select that local currency.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.160]   If you're at a restaurant or if you're checking out of a hotel in a foreign
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.760]   country, now it's called the dynamic currency conversion.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:26.360]   I don't want to say it's a scam, but it is a revenue center to do that.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.360]   It's always local currency.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.600]   Anything else when you get to a city, how you make sure
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.680]   you have the best experience.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.640]   One of the amazing things about the points and miles community
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.040]   is pretty much everywhere you go.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.280]   Somebody is either there that's happy to help you, or somebody
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.520]   has detailed explanations of how they did it, things to see and things to avoid.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.160]   So just after so many years in the community, you're very lucky that
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.000]   there's forums and places to put out a, Hey, help me post in again.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.320]   People will jump to the rescue.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.600]   The biggest hack for that is become a part of this community.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.680]   There are multiple Facebook groups that you can go and join is where
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.960]   I would tell you to start, go and check out the travel on points.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.360]   Go and check out miles to memories, Facebook group, the
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.840]   frequent miler Facebook group.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.680]   If you're not on Facebook, you can head to the Reddit community.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.920]   Reddit credit cards is a great place to go and check out and meet
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   folks and then flyer talk.com.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   So the best way I do that is literally going to one of these communities
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.600]   and saying either searching for that city and somebody's written up a
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:22.080]   detailed, awesome experience or asking, Hey, I'm going to be going here.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.000]   Does anybody have any tips?
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.680]   And people are more than willing to help out.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.080]   That's the typical strategy.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.320]   I'm in a lot of those communities too, and we're going to be kicking one off
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.360]   for, for all the hacks here sometime in 2022, you mentioned a lot of forums.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.840]   What about any, any blogs that you love people, people in the
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.600]   community that others should follow?
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.880]   Yeah, a hundred percent.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.120]   We, we mentioned Gary earlier.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:48.640]   He's a borderline savant when it comes to the travel and loyalty industry, like
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   literally from a nuts and bolts perspective, if you really want to
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.000]   understand the inner workings of these things, you need to go and
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.560]   read view from over by Gary.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:00.160]   And if you're just a crazy points and miles, I'm going to extract maximum
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   value of earning and redeeming points.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.120]   Greg and Nick over at the frequent miler is a daily must read.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.800]   And then, uh, somebody that kind of takes, uh, a little bit of
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.640]   storytelling along with the, the nuts and bolts that are the folks over
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.400]   miles to memories that you got to follow.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.440]   So between those three sites, you're pretty much going to get everything
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.960]   that you need on a daily basis.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.360]   And really the boarding area network as a whole of which these bloggers all
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.800]   belong to the same network, boarding area.com.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.760]   Just get plugged in, spend a little bit of time.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.640]   Don't get overwhelmed.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:29.920]   Read something that catches your interest.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.320]   And sure enough, I he'll be down that rabbit hole with
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.400]   the rest of us in no time.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.960]   I'll link to all those in the show notes.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.040]   You mentioned some hacks that just broadly for, for cities.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.000]   What about your hometown?
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.800]   You live in Atlanta.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.200]   I'm curious, what do you, what would you tell someone listening?
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.040]   Who's taking their first trip to Atlanta that they should make
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.200]   sure they check off the list.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:52.160]   Besides checking out a world champion, Atlanta Braves baseball game, which I
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.680]   always recommend up at the new stadium.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.240]   It's a great time.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.480]   Atlanta, I would say five years ago as a place where people said, Hey, I want to
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.760]   come to a weekend trip in Atlanta.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.040]   I would have been like, eh, probably not.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.800]   Like it's just not a weekend spot to do, but Atlanta has done a great
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.880]   job of turning itself around the food scene, the revitalization of
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:12.120]   places like underground Atlanta, the pond city market are great places.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:15.640]   You check out, we have everything Martin Luther King and the civil
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.040]   rights site and museum to go.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.520]   And those sites to see, we have the largest aquarium in the world, the
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.440]   world of Coca-Cola, the college football hall of fame, like it's all right down
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.840]   there and plenty of things to go and see.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.800]   So those are some of the top attractions that I think is worthwhile.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   And as far as the eats go every week and new restaurants popping up in Atlanta,
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.760]   that's the new hottest upcoming chef.
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:40.680]   Also the Georgia film industry has completely taken off outside of LA.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:45.280]   Georgia is now the number two spot in the country for doing a movie and TV show.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.800]   There's always celebrities in town, filming something to places, booming, man.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.520]   Um, so I would go and check it out to a favorite restaurants.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.080]   Marcel is a French restaurant.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.800]   Please make reservations far in advance.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.240]   You want to go check that out and bring your significant other
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.120]   there for a great night.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:04.080]   And then, uh, Yebo beach house, Y E B O up in the city of Buckhead, where all
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.440]   the brand new hotels, the Thompson Buckhead has just opened the Hyatt
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.960]   centric Buckhead has just opened the Yebo beach house, go and get some
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.200]   amazing South African fair there.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.440]   And you can actually walk there from the new Thompson hotel.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.480]   It's going to be a great evening.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.920]   So Atlanta on the up and up, man, we're excited.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.400]   Awesome.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.800]   This has been fantastic.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.560]   I'm sure there's going to be some questions out of this.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.720]   We might have to have to bring it back on or do a followup, but where can people
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.680]   find everything you're working on online?
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.800]   Yeah, of course.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.560]   Again, download the built rewards app and check out everything we're doing there.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   But you can find me at Kerr points, K E R R on Instagram and
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.560]   Twitter is where I am most active.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.280]   Love to hear the feedback.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.680]   Great, bad, and ugly about built rewards.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.200]   But also I talk points and miles and travel 24, seven, and I
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.640]   post my travel adventures.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.280]   That sounds great.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.440]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.800]   My absolute pleasure, man.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.160]   Thanks.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.000]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.480]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.080]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.720]   podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it, especially Spotify
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.000]   since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.720]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.280]   hi, I'm Chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.560]   That's it for this week.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.520]   I'll see you next week.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.920]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.680]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.840]   It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.720]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.800]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.080]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.000]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.120]   So entertaining.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:00.640]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.760]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.720]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.360]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.000]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.960]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.560]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.200]   with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.360]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.720]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.200]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
