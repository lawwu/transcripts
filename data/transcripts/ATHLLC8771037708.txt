[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.800]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.160]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you here.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.920]   As I mentioned in my short episode a few weeks ago, I want to bring more travel
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.680]   and credit card points content to this show in 2022.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.600]   So I am excited to be joined today by Richard Kerr.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960]   Richard's a veteran naval officer who left that career behind to become one of
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.560]   the top experts in the world on travel loyalty programs, credit cards, and
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.360]   points strategy.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.680]   He's the founder of the Award Travel 101 Facebook community and spent six years
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.320]   at The Points Guy as a contributor, an editor, and the director of travel
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.960]   partnerships.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.080]   He's now at the up-and-coming credit card company, Bilt, running travel rewards.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.520]   We're going to talk about where he thinks points and miles programs are
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.880]   heading in 2022.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.280]   We're going to hear some of his favorite redemptions out there, learn all his
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.440]   travel hacks, both on the booking and travel side, and get an update on the new
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.480]   Bilt card and how to get off the wait list.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.480]   I am sure I'm missing a few things because there is so much to cover.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.520]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.880]   Richard, thanks for being here.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.280]   Hey man, my pleasure.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400]   And that word you use to describe your show, upgrading.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.160]   I'm all about it.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.680]   Yeah, I'm constantly seeking out upgrades in all aspects of life.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.240]   So before we get started, I would love if you could just share what led you down
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.960]   this rabbit hole.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.120]   Yeah, a really long story short is I was in the Navy and at one point I had to
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.440]   choose between spending $3,000 on last minute economy tickets to see my family
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.320]   after I had not seen them for a year because of deployments or just skipping
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.360]   Christmas and not seeing them.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   And I chose to spend the $3,000 from my wife and I thought there has to be a
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.040]   better way.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   Luckily I found that better way.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.560]   And for whatever reason, it clicked with me and down the rabbit hole, I went
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.840]   spending the next almost seven years in the Navy, being able to travel around
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   wherever we were stationed, having family travel, thanks to points and miles.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.400]   And I took it and literally and proverbially ran with it.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.120]   And can you briefly touch on what you were doing before points and miles?
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.640]   So before doing points and miles full time, my last job in the Navy was the
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.240]   logistics officer for Marine One, the president's helicopter.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.680]   I got there when president Obama was leaving office and president Trump was
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.000]   coming in and I had a lot of jobs there to make sure that helicopter could fly
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.040]   parts, gas all over the world.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.920]   But the one thing I'll let you, the inside tip on that president Trump loves
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.320]   his tropical starburst and his Pringles, the man hammered them.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.520]   So we had the credit card of which was of course not earning any points because
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.880]   it was a government card, but a lot of starburst Pringles for Marine One in my
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.320]   last year.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.920]   The week would finish and I would have a trip planned to hop somewhere for the
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.880]   weekend, wherever we were, of course, on points and miles.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.520]   And I decided that I want to do this full time.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.920]   Navy has been great, but I'm out.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.400]   So you've built up probably an arsenal of knowledge that few others have.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.120]   So just to kick off, I want to talk about the current state of things in the
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.440]   points and miles world and maybe recap where we're at and what some of the big
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.160]   things happening in the last few years are.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.560]   And maybe we start with airline and hotel programs and I'll kick us off saying, I
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.240]   think one of the biggest trends I've seen and I'd love to hear your kind of take
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.200]   and maybe explain what it means is this kind of trend towards these fixed
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.240]   redemptions to a more dynamic program.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.920]   Yeah, you know, it's what the programs in my mind should exist to drive a
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.800]   recurring business.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   And you might think that's very simple.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.600]   What is turned into for many airlines and hotels is it's a revenue arm more
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.280]   than anything else.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.160]   And in the case of most of the big airlines and some of the hotels, the
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.240]   revenue arm that is the loyalty program is worth more than the airline itself.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.200]   We saw during COVID several of the large carriers take out loans against their
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.240]   loyalty programs to get cash to keep operating.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.760]   And once that they figured this out through all kinds of deals and
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.920]   partnerships and, you know, passengers and hotel guests being willing to buy
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.600]   points at what I think are crazy rates that said they honed in on it.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.320]   And that's led to the state of what we see today and most large loyalty
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.400]   programs, which is nothing is fixed.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.160]   Nothing is predictable and everything is designed to drive maximum revenue rather
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.280]   than, in my opinion, in most cases, earn repeat business.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.120]   Now you might think that's really bad thing.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.040]   At the end of the day, you and I, and people who listen still get to do amazing
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.200]   things because of points and miles.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.160]   So it's not all doom and gloom.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.240]   It's just a different environment than we're operating in.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.400]   So a couple of listeners have sent me this YouTube video that I'll link to in the
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.160]   show notes where I can't remember the name of the guy who did it walks through.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.240]   Here's exactly how these businesses work and why you should really think of the
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   miles programs as banks almost.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   And so I'll put that, yeah, I'll put that in the show notes.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.360]   But, and just to clarify, it used to be that there was a chart and it said, Hey,
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.960]   if you want to travel from the United States to Europe, it's this many miles.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.720]   So that's what it is.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.040]   And now I don't know if there's any airline that's fully a hundred percent
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.520]   dynamic dollar for point other than the ones who've always done it Southwest
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.680]   and JetBlue, but, but the main American Delta United, but you can still get some
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.120]   of those low cost non-dynamic awards, but they've taken all of the award inventory.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   That's not at the low price and made it seemingly sometimes, at least with Delta,
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.720]   it's, I'm not going to spend a million points to fly to New York this weekend.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.520]   Yeah, no, there's overall, there's still deals to be had and actually
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.400]   bring up the point of Delta.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.280]   I can't keep Delta miles in my account because I'm constantly redeeming
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.640]   them for economy domestic flights.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.280]   Because in the world of dynamics, as high as things may be, there are still
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.200]   low deals out there all the time.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.920]   And maybe it's cause I'm an Atlanta guy, but oftentimes Delta is
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.240]   the most expensive out of Atlanta.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.600]   But to your point, every currency and program now almost has its uses.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.240]   If you want to fly luxury premium classes, don't collect Delta SkyMiles.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   If you want to get your family afford to the beach or grandma's
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.880]   house a few times a year, I think SkyMiles can make it happen.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.120]   So along with the bads of, you know, now some redemptions are crazy priced.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.520]   Almost every program does have the great deals.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.400]   American has these web fair deals where you can fly one way in the U.S.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.280]   for 5,000 miles to like really good, like on the weekends on holidays.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.000]   So it's just kind of wild.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.560]   And to my mind comes back to you.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.160]   There's, there's no predictability left.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.600]   You're not really sure what to prepare for.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.240]   And what do you think about hotel programs?
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.960]   What's been going on with hotel loyalty?
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.160]   I always try to figure out a better and more polite way to say this, but I usually fail.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.440]   Unfortunately, Marriott has destroyed its program to a point where I don't know why
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.400]   you would invest in the Bonvoy program anymore, and I'm sure you have lots of
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.760]   listeners who are going to be up in arms about that because they love their Marriott.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   We're a couple of weeks out of time of recording from award jars being
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.920]   completely Marriott IT on a good day is a broken disaster.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.760]   The phone agents are not empowered.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.720]   Social media team can't do anything for you.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.640]   Probably a high likelihood, your points are going to be calculated
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.400]   incorrectly from every stay and goodness.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.920]   If you have certificates and points that you want to combine or use to do anything
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.280]   outside of the norm, it's just not going to happen.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.040]   So it's really a shame because SPG was amazing.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.240]   Marriott rewards is pretty good.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.400]   They've combined them and they've just, I have no idea what the strategy has been
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   over there, except trying to minimize costs for hotel owners.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.040]   So Marriott, I'm sorry.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.280]   I just, I'm going to go to the portal and earn 10 X venture rewards rather
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.760]   than trying to collect the points.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.800]   As far as everyone else goes, there's still a gold standard in my
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.440]   mind of, of hotel programs, which is the world of height.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.160]   Their points are just incredibly valuable.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.520]   You can book luxurious aspirational stays as easily as you can book again, that
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.120]   room for your family, where you just need to stay next to the airport for one night.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.880]   And then everybody else has got their uses.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.480]   I mean, Hilton continues to offer huge signup bonuses, continue to
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.920]   be able to find value there as a traveling family.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.440]   Again, you can now book connecting rooms with points, which we just
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.600]   did in Orlando, which is great.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.360]   I'm not a big fan of what they've done with some of their elite benefits, like
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.840]   not giving free breakfast anymore, but it's fine because I just go and stay at Hyatt.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.640]   So overall, I think it's still a war charts going by the wayside, except for Hyatt.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.680]   It's not predictable how many points you're going to have to
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.640]   need or you're going to need anymore.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.800]   And it's all about maximizing the revenue off of these programs, rather
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.160]   than encouraging repeat loyalty.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   So it's very interesting to see how quickly it's changed.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.400]   And what do you think happens in the coming years?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.560]   Are, is Hyatt going to follow the way of Marriott is what changes do you think
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   happened 2022 and, and I guess beyond to these programs, both airline and hotel?
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.520]   We can talk for a very long time about the difference with hotel loyalty
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.600]   programs is that the majority of the hotels in these programs are not owned
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.800]   by Hyatt or they're not owned by Marriott.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.840]   They're owned by individual investors who pay marketing and licensing
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   and program dollars to the big corporate.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.840]   But ultimately they have a huge say to Marriott that says, we're
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.840]   not going to do this elite breakfast because it's too expensive for us.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   And you don't reimburse us enough.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.360]   And the corporates tie hands are tied a little bit as far
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.600]   as most of the programs go.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.200]   I think what we're going to see happen, which we've seen a really big uptake in
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.080]   2021, the beginning of 22 is hotels actually leaving programs like Marriott.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.000]   They've lost a couple hotels in Venice in the last few weeks, and they've
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.360]   lost tons of properties to Sinesta.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.960]   And if you haven't heard that hotel chain Sinesta, I guarantee you, you're
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.760]   going to hear it over the next couple of years that they've almost tripled in
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.720]   size in just the last two years by acquiring hotels that are leaving
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.320]   programs like IHG and Marriott.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.160]   And unless those franchise agreements are fixed, I don't see things getting better.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.240]   Now what Hyatt has done a good job is their franchise agreements and their
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.560]   terms and conditions of the program are written so that there's very little gray
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.160]   area, like the properties know what they're getting into, they know what
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.240]   they're going to get reimbursed, and Hyatt does a great job of making sure
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.480]   that things are executed well.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.920]   So I don't think, and I don't hope we're going to see Hyatt go the way that other
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.600]   programs have gone because of how they've structured these agreements with the
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.760]   property owners and how popular that program really is and continues to be
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.840]   with its members, like the program really does drive repeat guests.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.400]   So I hope we see things kind of stay where they are as far as these programs
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   are going to continue to struggle.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.160]   And this program's going to continue to do really well.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.800]   Do you think anything changes with flights and flight airline loyalty this year?
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.600]   If you'd asked me that last year, I would've said no, but then American came
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.680]   out and said, we're going to completely redo how elite qualifying works in our
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.200]   program.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.760]   And it's really quite interesting.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.560]   And I think it's great.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.840]   If you're not familiar with American loyalty points, give that a quick Google
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   on the machine and read up, but basically you don't need to fly American anymore
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.640]   to get elite status, which is really quite amazing statement to say you can
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.920]   earn status off of spending on their co-branded cards, off of shopping with
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.520]   their partners, booking hotels and vacations through them.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.080]   And you can go fly American twice a year and have top tier status.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.720]   I would argue rather easily for anybody that's really trying.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.360]   So that's really interesting.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.680]   And it's going to be even more fascinating the rest of this year to see how that
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.600]   goes and how it's picked up and typically in the airline industry, it's rather
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   copycat what airline A does, at least amongst the big three B and C are quick
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.080]   to follow, so I'm sure Delta and United are watching with great interest, how
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.040]   this is working and what kind of revenue is going to drive for the advantage
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.560]   program, um, of which I'm a loyal member of American, which we can talk about
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.600]   for several reasons, but I think it's great.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.640]   I think it's interesting and we will see American could turn around if they
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.760]   don't like what they see after the first year and say that was a really
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.400]   interesting experiment, but, uh, no more, or we could see Delta United go.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.760]   You know what?
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.520]   That's a great idea.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.100]   Let's follow.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.320]   And you don't even need to fly airlines anymore to get status, which
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.960]   again, is a remarkable statement.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.320]   I hack here.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   I have listeners sometimes write in and say, you know, I have this business,
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.160]   I'm spending millions of dollars a year, and it seems to often be on
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.680]   categories that are nothing right.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.440]   This, someone said, I'm a contractor.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.320]   I spend almost a million dollars a year on hardware and supply stores, and I
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.760]   could put it all on a credit card, what should I do?
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.800]   And I, you know, I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.840]   It kind of is a very personal question, but if you value status on American and
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.520]   you've got a bunch of spend, that's not going to earn you five points, there's
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.200]   four points or three points, an option is to use that spend to buy yourself
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.880]   American status at least this year.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.480]   And, and we'll see how long that lasts.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.400]   Cause on top of that, you get redeemable miles as well.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.000]   And American miles are fantastic, great value to do luxury
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.880]   or weekender flights around.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.000]   So I find myself very much more engaged with the advantage program, which
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.120]   is what they're hoping for, you know, shopping portals and things like that.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.640]   American offers earn you status.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.080]   So like I tell the wife, Hey, if you're going to be doing any shoppers
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.440]   weekend, you know, to go to that advantage shopping portal, right?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.200]   Cause we want status again next year.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.480]   The shopping portals I think are, are underrated in that.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.080]   Sometimes it's, it's a point here.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.200]   You could, you could use Rakuten or anything to get a point.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.040]   And sometimes you get these crazy offers where it's 10, 20 miles per dollar.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.200]   And so, you know, it's frustrating to look.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.000]   I think there's a site I'll link it in the show notes.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And I want to say it is cashback monitor.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.040]   And they'll, they'll give you both the shopping portals and the
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.600]   cashback portals for both of them.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.320]   And it's pretty cool.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.960]   They sometimes those I've gotten 10, 10 points per dollar before on, I think, I
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.600]   think American, so at the end of 2021, a crazy deal came out that was for every
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.280]   dollar you donated to conservation international, which is like a featured
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.640]   mastercard charity yet 40 miles per dollar.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.880]   And you're thinking, Hey, that's pretty good.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.000]   But at the end of the year, American also had a five X on all.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.520]   Portal bonuses going on as well.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.880]   So you got 240 American miles per dollar donated to conservation international.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.640]   Um, and American honored it.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.160]   And people went all in on this thing.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.800]   Like I have friends and colleagues that donated $25,000 to
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.480]   conservation international to get millions of American miles at they,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.120]   they pre-funded five years or 10 years of travel for 25 grand all in business
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   class, by the way, because once you have 20 million American miles, like it
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   doesn't matter, you can book whatever you want, whenever you want.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.240]   And it's really quite fantastic.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.520]   It sounds like a story from days of the past, but this was six weeks ago.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   And I did get a little taste of it.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.000]   I did donate, uh, I think 300 bucks and got 72,000 American miles, which is more
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.960]   than enough to fly business class across the Atlantic.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.560]   So I look at it as buying business class for 300 bucks.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.080]   That's crazy.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.480]   I've been trying to think about.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.880]   I've never been the social media person is just like all over it.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.640]   I looked at a survey I did with listeners and they're like, that's what they want.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.360]   So I'm going to start using my social media solely to just post
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.720]   when these crazy deals come out.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.080]   So, so, you know, give me a follow if you want, I'll stay on top of them.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.440]   Sorry.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.040]   Sorry for everyone who missed the American one.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.880]   I also missed it.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.360]   The end of the year was just too crazy.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.880]   But, um, you know, on top of that, I guess you probably get a
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.080]   tax write-off on the donation.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.560]   You do it keeps, keeps going and going.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.400]   And if you look at it, there's some great websites out there that rate
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.440]   charities, like I always go and look at the charity navigators.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.240]   One of them that tells you like the expense ratio, like conservation
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   international was an a plus plus in every category.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.080]   So you felt confident giving that money to this.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.280]   I just want to know who was the guy or gal that set this deal with American.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.040]   What kind of Christmas party did conservation international have after
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.920]   probably getting millions of dollars of donations over the course of a
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.800]   couple of days, like good job over there.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.520]   Who lost out in that?
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.000]   Like, is this American losing money?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.480]   No, there's some really great insights into this deal specifically by my
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.160]   buddy, Gary left at view from the wing, who wrote several articles
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.280]   over who was funding this.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.040]   What basically happens is the charity paid none of it because they wouldn't
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.000]   agree to be in these portals if they were taking a lump of it, but it
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.120]   basically came down to mastercard funding it because this was done through
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.200]   the mastercard website called simply miles where you link a card and anytime
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.640]   you use it at a participating merchant, you get bonus miles, great details of
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.000]   a math, how basically nobody lost to believe it or not in the way that this
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.560]   works again, because of tax write-offs and the pricing that you can have when
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.040]   you control it in the way that you can carry that liability of these miles.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.800]   And while we think it's millions and millions of miles is a big
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   deal from these promotions.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.680]   The grand scheme of things, the amount of miles that were given out
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.240]   on this based on how many miles are outstanding in the American
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.480]   books was inconsequential.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.480]   And then if you ever want to go into loyalty accounting, who it is a
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.160]   complex in a rather amazing space about how they can defer the liability of
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.760]   these unredeemed miles to where nobody took a hit for this happening in the
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.680]   charity one, really fascinating stuff.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.000]   Wow.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.440]   Okay.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.400]   So I'm going to link to that Gary's article.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.760]   Well, fantastic blog at the end.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.480]   We'll recap some of the favorite people you follow and blogs,
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.440]   but that's all hotel loyalty.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.880]   I think a big thing that everyone listening here wants to
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.960]   talk about is credit cards.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.440]   So I kind of want to talk about the space because we'll get to built,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.520]   but a lot of crazy things have been happening in credit cards in the last
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.280]   few years, and it feels like all of the issuers, the big issuers or the big
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   four, at least are merging to the same place.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.200]   And then city is just like, went on the side.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.440]   I don't know.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.360]   I don't know what to say.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.280]   Wilting on the side.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.400]   Where do you think we're at?
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.680]   It seems like the average person that used to collect five or six
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   cards now has three priority pass memberships could buy global
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.160]   entry for their entire family.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.480]   I'm curious what you think of the state of cards.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.440]   And one way I think it's a race to the bottom.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.920]   You cannot have the customer acquisition costs that these cards are now
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.080]   having and expect to make money because the demographic that's getting
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.600]   these cards in large part, they're not going to revolve, meaning they're
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.040]   not going to pay 25 to 30% interest.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.840]   And you're just getting the interchange off of them.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.640]   So looking at recent examples of the capital one venture X, you
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.200]   cannot go in an airport, turn on a sport show or look at commercials
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   right now without seeing the same.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.680]   It was like what in the Rose bowl, capital one venture X.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.920]   I was in the airports this weekend.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.360]   I see it.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.600]   That's on top of giving people a hundred thousand venture miles,
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.520]   which costs capital one money on top of a $200 vacation rental credit on
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.800]   top of paying blogs and content creators, who knows how much per card approval.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.200]   So with all of that marketing, tangible signup benefits and everything like
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.640]   the quick numbers show you they're over $2,000 per customer acquisition cost.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.920]   I don't know how they make that back.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.000]   I really don't.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.600]   And I think it's the, the, the, uh, chase Sapphire reserve reincarnated.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.640]   When that thing came out in 2016, it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.840]   Everybody had to have it.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.920]   But then that first report came out that showed how much money chase loss on the
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.480]   customer acquisition costs and how far it like to the magnitude of 20 X, what
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.200]   they expected to lose, to get these customers and what do we see now?
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.760]   Five years later, that car is being moonlighted because it's losing a
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.960]   ridiculous amount of money.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.240]   Customers are not revolving.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.960]   And we've seen the value propositions of the chase Sapphire preferred move to be
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.120]   arguably better for a $95 annual fee rather than $550, which is why I really
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.080]   scratch my head when I see capital one, come out with this and go great for the
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.920]   consumers, don't get me wrong, like my wife and I both picked this thing up and
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.120]   now we have hundreds of thousands of venture miles, but they're not making any
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.320]   money.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.960]   So why wouldn't they take all of these efforts and make the venture card, which
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.880]   is a wonderful card for, especially for people who just don't want anything
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.200]   complicated and want to get miles and all the great improvements capital ones made
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.240]   with their loyalty program and replay the chase Sapphire reserve playbook where you
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.120]   go awesome, but just make the venture card better, not do this luxury card thing.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.760]   To your point that like, I don't need another priority pass membership.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.440]   I don't need another global entry deal.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.360]   What are we doing here?
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.560]   Is it because FOMO is because you just have to have something out there as a
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.080]   loss leader to get new customers.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.880]   So what do you think, man?
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.760]   Like why, why, why throw this out and no, you're probably not going to make money.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.920]   Yeah, I guess my perspective is that if I look at all these cards and I talk to
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   people, I know everyone seems to have come to the terms that they're going to
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.240]   hold a card that has a 500 ish dollar annual fee.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.680]   And because capital one didn't have one, it was kind of like, well, it doesn't
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.200]   make sense.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:55.040]   Like even, even if the extra incremental perks for the card aren't worth the extra
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.160]   fee, it just feels to me like it's never felt like capital one had a card worth
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.000]   holding and, and what was funny.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.560]   So then venture X comes out huge signup bonuses.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.800]   I get one, my wife gets one.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.240]   I tell my sister to get one and, and she, my sister's not thinking about the
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.720]   bonuses as much as "Is this a card I'll spend on?"
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.480]   And she looks at the card and she's like, "Well, it seems like the venture card's
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.640]   just as good.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.680]   Like, I don't, there's three lounges.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.000]   I've already got priority paths."
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.440]   So I was looking at it, I was like, "Man, I guess it was just like it convinced me
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.080]   to sign up for the huge bonus.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.600]   But I see, I feel like it's gonna be hard at the end of the year to not consider
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.520]   downgrading to just have the venture card for, for less.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.960]   But assuming they allow downgrading, I think I have a card.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.000]   No, I agree.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.680]   Like, why would you hold a venture X long-term over the venture card?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.400]   I don't, I don't know.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.560]   The bonus earnings, the portal grade, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.400]   But overall it's the competition of massive signup bonuses.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.440]   So we've seen American Express the last six months has just let the wheels off and
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.400]   been like with the resi and small business offer.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.640]   If you sign up for the right referral platinum card at the right time, you could
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.480]   be earning like 18 X on almost all spent like 18 points per dollar on your American
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:09.160]   Express platinum card and people earning millions of, of points.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.240]   Like I don't, how are we making money on this folks?
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.520]   I just don't understand this.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.520]   And is it because the executives in charge now, by the time the chickens come home to
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.320]   roost are not going to be in that position anymore.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.560]   They're just being lauded by how many new customer accounts are driving right now,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.000]   which is a huge key metric for any bank executive is how many new accounts have
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.960]   you got, like, I don't know, it's pure speculation, this eventually has to all be
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   redeemed at a real cost.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.880]   And I'm not sure what the banks are doing, how long this is sustainable, or if it's
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:43.160]   just one of those, like it's become so much money that it's funny money and we can
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.080]   figure out other metrics and KPIs to show success of this in market, how much market
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   share we gained versus real dollars and cents that are lost.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.000]   So it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.960]   It doesn't make sense to a lot of my colleagues now over here built as we design
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.880]   a credit card and a rewards program, because what we want to do is be sustainable.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.840]   And the stuff I see now just, just isn't unless there's some magic key that I don't
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.240]   know about.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   I want to get to built, but I'm going to get annihilated by people writing in.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.400]   If I don't go back and say, can you walk through this 18 X?
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.800]   Cause that's something that I think some people I know are going to ask me if I
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.720]   don't ask that question.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.040]   There was, there was a MX platinum offer that came out from resi, like the table,
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.960]   the reser, we can make a reservation at a restaurant with a partnership that said,
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.920]   Hey, sign up for the platinum card, get 125,000 membership rewards after the 5,000
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.520]   and spin plus get 10 X points at all restaurants worldwide.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.680]   And Oh, by the way, get eight X at any small business.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.520]   So if your small business is also a restaurant, 18 X, you can also go on the
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.000]   small business website finder that MX has.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.440]   And probably a lot of the places that you shop all the time, don't realize that
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.920]   they're small businesses and they're throwing like huge offers at you to go and
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   spend there as well as statement credits as well as MX offers to go and shop it.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.000]   And it was just absolutely wild.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.280]   You can just hit the Google machine, type in MX platinum resi, small business, and
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   you'll number one, have FOMO because you missed out.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.160]   It's just, and then to my point, when I read these things go, who in the world is
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.040]   funding, who in the world is funding 18 X like this stuff.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.480]   And is that still going on?
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.720]   It's not sadly about two weeks ago, it's gone, but a great story.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.560]   I got to share about my friend, Nick Reyes over at a frequent modeler.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.840]   He's been trying to buy a brand new car on a credit card, left my dealership
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.320]   to find the entire credit card.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.720]   I was able to do this in 2015.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.560]   He was very upset that he wasn't able to, so he was going to one up me.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.840]   And sure enough, he did.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   He had an MX platinum card that had a retention offer, a signup bonus
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.320]   offer, and a small business offer.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.000]   And he ended up getting over a half million MX points by putting his entire
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   new minivan on his MX platinum card, but two weeks ago, and, and it's because
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.280]   he was able to stack all these offers.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.160]   And in my mind, I go, the dealership just paid three to 4% to American express,
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.400]   American express just paid out 500,000 points, like everybody loses
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.120]   and, and the consumer wins big.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.560]   So how is this ecosystem sustainable?
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.640]   I really don't know, but it's amazing what goes on.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.240]   But as long as it's out there, take advantage of the big signup bonuses,
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.920]   take advantage of some of these offers.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.800]   And I assume by offers you mean, you mean a lot of the offers that are in the
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.000]   portals when you log in and you, you view those, the offers that are add
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.400]   to card or their other offers.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.600]   There's there's MX offers, um, MX American express specifically comes
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.760]   out with these limited time, like dining credits to head last year.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.280]   You get Uber credits to come on your platinum card.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.320]   It seems like you need a spreadsheet to keep up with all of these things.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.520]   City has mastercard merchant offers.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.280]   Now chase has offers now bank of America does that says, Hey, shop at this store.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.560]   You spend 20 bucks and we'll give you either bonus miles or
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.680]   we'll give you 10 bucks back.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.600]   And then what you do is you stack all of these together.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.640]   And like, I'm going into the weeds right now.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.800]   People, but I just want to whet the appetite a little bit to know.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.000]   There's a better way to do what you're doing.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.280]   Most likely if, if you want to earn American airline status, for example,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.640]   when you have a mastercard, say you want to buy some wine, there's some great
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.880]   wine offers out there from wine clubs, wine, ink, wink, w I N C.com.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.680]   They have city merchant offers.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.960]   They're going to give you bonus America miles from simple miles.com.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.160]   And then you can shop through the advantage shopping portal and you can
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.480]   essentially get by stacking these three deals together, like statement credit,
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.200]   bonus miles, and wine show up at your door for either nothing or
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.480]   very little out of pocket.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.920]   And Oh, by the way, you're earning American airline status
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.000]   on that as of this year.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.160]   And it's become like, fun.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.480]   Yes.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.760]   How, what can I do to get, like, I want to get some wine for Valentine's
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.880]   day next week as a recording this, like I went ahead and ordered four bottles
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.240]   of wine from wink got 2,500 American miles.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.120]   And then the statement credit from city that made it cost a dollar 50
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.360]   for four bottles of wine to show up.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:45.680]   Great.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.840]   Happy Valentine's day wife.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.080]   Hope she's not listening.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.040]   You all know, I love credit card points.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.720]   So I'm excited to be partnering with card pointers today, which is one of
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.680]   my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.300]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.080]   bonuses on every purchase.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.480]   You can also load it on your partner's phone.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.120]   So they always know the best cards to use.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.240]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.920]   credit from over 5,000 cards.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.000]   And they also track and help you use your Amex chase bank of America or
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.600]   Citibank offers to save even more money every day and with their browser
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.040]   extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and chase offer in
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.280]   just one click and because of that massive credit card database, you can
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.560]   do all of this without having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.040]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.080]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.920]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:02.320]   will, you can go to all the hacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.400]   Again, that's all the hacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.720]   Getting the crew together.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.280]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.000]   I get it.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.280]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.560]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.640]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.520]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.080]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.120]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.960]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.120]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.880]   just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.120]   to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.440]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.920]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.600]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.520]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.600]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.600]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.520]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.880]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.600]   Have you played around with Card Pointers?
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.520]   There it's an app and a Chrome extension.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.320]   I have not.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.560]   I have not heard of Card Pointers.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.000]   So Card Pointers launched this app and they also have a Chrome extension.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.480]   And similar to if anyone's ever had one of the Rakuten or Shopping Portal
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.640]   Chrome extensions, they do this for the offers.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.400]   So you're on a website and they do two things.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.920]   One, they pop up and say, "Hey, if you're going to buy something
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.400]   here, this is the card to use."
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:50.200]   So you can go in and say, "I have a Platinum, a Venture X, Chase Reserve,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.720]   whatever," and then they'll say, "Hey, if you're going to check out on
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.800]   this website, make sure to use this card for the most points."
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.680]   But what they also do is say, "Hey, before you check out, Amex
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.440]   has an offer for this merchant.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.920]   So make sure you go to the Amex site and you load that offer in there."
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.200]   So I've been playing around with the app.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.960]   Yeah, I have no relationship.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.760]   The founder emailed me and was like, "Hey, thanks for mentioning us."
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.160]   I don't get anything for mentioning them.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.200]   But these offers change so frequently on the card sites that if you don't
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.960]   have something to remind you, you just have to open up Amex and Chase
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.320]   and everything every morning and look.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.240]   Two things to jump back to card stuff you mentioned.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.840]   You said they're moonlighting the Chase Reserve.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.960]   Do you think that that card goes away or loses all of its luster?
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   Because I think a lot of people listening, that's their go-to card.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.920]   I think people need to re-evaluate the value prop of the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.160]   for, again, $450 less annual fee, basically earning the same points.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.440]   And then the additional benefits of the CSR where people are like, "Oh, I can
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:56.120]   redeem for 1.5 cents instead of 1.25 cents," but are you redeeming 750,000
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.520]   points at that marginal quarter to make the annual fee $450 annual fee up?
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.360]   And they're like, "Oh, no, I'm not."
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.680]   I'm like, "Then you don't need the CSR."
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.160]   I don't think the card goes away.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.640]   I just think there's less and less incentive to hold it.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.880]   And the signup bonus is never going to be a hundred thousand again.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.440]   And they're going to do everything they can to their other products
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.800]   to drive people away from it.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.840]   Which is, again, it was the gold standard of the credit card industry five years ago.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.680]   So it's really interesting to see that happen to the product.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.800]   But I just want people to take a hard look at why you're going to
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.080]   pay the annual fee for another year.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.000]   Yeah, I feel like Amex is in a similar boat where I find myself telling people,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.480]   "Look, the Amex Platinum has a bunch of perks.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.840]   And if the perks are worth the annual fee, maybe it's worth it."
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.520]   Most of the time, the reason I recommend the Platinum is because they're
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.400]   getting $150,000 or some ridiculous signup bonus.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.760]   But when I think about what I spend my money on, the Amex Gold is kind of like...
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.440]   It's a trend now is that all these card issuers launch these super
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.520]   premium cards with huge signup bonuses.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.480]   But the card that most people probably should be using more
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.840]   regularly is their cheaper card.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.280]   Yeah, because after they issue all those points, they can't afford to keep
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.720]   paying your points in bonus categories.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.200]   But yeah, $695,000 for the Platinum card, the vast majority of people, I would
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.280]   argue, who hold that don't need to.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.200]   And it's just become incredibly frustrating to use the benefits or what's
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.040]   now going around as the Amex Coupon Booklet, just to try and keep up with
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   everything, and then when you come out on the same day with a SoulCycle
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.240]   offer and Walmart Plus, you're like, "These are very different American
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.520]   demographics. Who are we going after here, folks?
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.000]   Like, who's this card for?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Because I don't know anymore."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.840]   It's wild.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.720]   For me, the Amex Platinum, it's the Coupon Booklet, and it makes
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.920]   sense if you book a lot of flights.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.720]   If you travel a lot, great, yeah.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.360]   I don't know where you're getting 5X on flights that you can book on the
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.960]   airline's website and not have to book through a portal, but outside of that,
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.200]   you've got to really work hard.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.880]   I've got to work hard.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.000]   I'm like, "What am I going to buy at Saks before the end of the year?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.480]   I've got to spend my $50."
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.520]   And I try to justify that those $50 are worth $50, but I'm not actually
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   buying this fancy hand soap or whatever it is on the list this year.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.800]   And the last thing, and then I want to jump to Bilt, is Citi.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.600]   All these conversations I'm having now are Cap One, they're Amex, they're
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.760]   Chase, they're now including Bilt.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.320]   Like, is Citi out of the game?
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.640]   Are they trying to get in the game?
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.840]   Citi's struggled a long time with who they are.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.560]   Thank you points are a great currency.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.320]   Their big struggle is that they don't have any domestic transfer partners.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.120]   So if you want to fly domestically, it's a problem, which is I think
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.440]   Capital One's biggest knock right now for everything great they've done.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.080]   They still don't have a domestic transfer partner, but thank you
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.880]   points as they stand on their own are a great currency.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:35.120]   All the ancillaries of dealing with Citi are my problem.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.680]   So if you've got new Citi cards about the fraud alert shenanigans that
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.720]   happen and the endless loop of trying to get out of these fraud alert
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.400]   shenanigans, Citi IT really struggles.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.280]   And then they decimated the Citi Prestige, which was an amazing card
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.840]   four or five years ago, down to a shell of his former self and not
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.480]   even open for applications anymore.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.080]   I don't think anybody should be ignoring Citi, Citi Double Cash or
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.880]   any two Citi thank you points on every dollar is great that you can
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.520]   combine with the big signup bonus of the Citi Premier, which has nice
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.000]   bonus categories, I think it's great.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.040]   But sometimes Citi just absolutely frustrates you from the customer
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.240]   experience that you don't want to mess with them anymore, which is
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.280]   what happened to me in my life.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.640]   I just endless fraud alerts, trying to get out of it.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.880]   They're like, you have to give us the chase login and your chase account
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.560]   in order for us to verify you on Citi.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.320]   It's a real story.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.560]   And it's a real thing that they do.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.160]   And then you like think it's all cleared up and then you go and swipe
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.080]   the card, declined fraud alert, call us.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.280]   And you're just like, okay, I'm done.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.440]   It's, it's just absolutely maddening from a customer's perspective
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.200]   sometime to use it, but you know, I keep Citi thank you points in the
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.800]   bank account sitting around just in case they have access to a few
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.120]   programs that nobody else does.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.440]   They just really got to clean up that user experience and get them
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   excited again and again, decide who are their cards for and
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.120]   what do they want to be?
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.200]   Yep.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.960]   That makes sense.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.720]   So I want to talk about built, right?
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.400]   You guys have basically, you spent the last decade in this industry
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.720]   trying to figure out how it all works and reporting on from every angle.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.240]   And now you're actually on the ground building a new card and thinking
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.640]   about it with all that perspective.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.040]   So I touched on it briefly, right?
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.440]   We talked about in a past episode, I think it was Brian Kelly.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.600]   He mentioned built, we talked about how it earns points on rent, but
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.160]   maybe give a quick recap of, you know, what the card does and kind of who it's for.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.200]   So built rewards is a standalone loyalty program.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.720]   Anybody can participate in the built rewards loyalty program if you
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.960]   live in the built rewards Alliance.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.400]   So we've gone out and partnered with the largest real estate companies in the world.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.800]   We have 2 million apartments in the United States now that are
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.040]   in the built rewards Alliance.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.800]   If you download our app and pay your landlord through our app, and they're
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.200]   all directly integrated with us, we give you 250 points a month, cost
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.880]   nothing, there's no fees, we just want to give you something where
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.400]   you previously got nothing.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.080]   Need the card.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.240]   That's just, that's just the loyalty program.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.400]   And what's happening is, and why the landlords and real estate people are
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.280]   so excited is it's really expensive in many markets to find new qualified
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.800]   tenants or to retain tenants.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.600]   There's been no marketing lever that they can pull to say, resign a lease
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.800]   with us, except for giving cash out of their pockets and it's paying a
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.920]   broker a month's rent, a month and a half rent to go and find a new tenant.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.440]   Now they can issue bill points.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.960]   So if you're saying 250 points, isn't a lot like that's not
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   really going to get me anything.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.600]   I'll tell you what the points are worth in a little bit, but.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.640]   Don't let the landlords can say, Hey, if you resign this lease, here's 20,000
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.840]   points, if you refer a friend to this building, we'll give you 20,000 points
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.520]   or whatever the landlord wants to issue.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.320]   If they have really want to attract somebody 50,000 bill points
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.120]   to come and sign a lease.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.560]   Sorry, you had a maintenance issue.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.440]   We had no way to make that right.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.200]   Now we're going to issue you 5,000 points and say, we're sorry that, you
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.040]   know, something in your apartment broke and the landlords are like, Holy smokes.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.960]   This is a great, this is a universal.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.160]   Loyalty program to attract and retain residents.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.720]   We're all in to the point that some of them are now investors with us.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.480]   But on top of that, we wanted to supersize earning ability and
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.840]   we created the build master card.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   And this is a no annual fee card open to soon to be open
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.320]   to anybody in the United States.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.400]   We've had it on a wait list for now, while we really perfect the product
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.040]   that's been out for less than a year.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.560]   But very soon, almost everybody in the United States will be able to
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.320]   apply for the built rewards card.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.840]   No annual fee card earns one X points on rent, no matter
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.000]   where you live in the country.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.480]   Any landlord you can pay.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.600]   You can pay in the built rewards app and we will mail your
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.960]   landlord a physical check.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.480]   Now you can use your built rewards master card as an
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.160]   ACH and pay your landlord.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.560]   Again, any landlord, any portal, rent cafe, click pay, all these things.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.240]   We'll give you a routing and checking account number that will
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.320]   charge to your built card earn one X points on rent, two X points on
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.080]   travel and three X points on dining.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.400]   And it's a world elite card with all kinds of crazy benefits that are really
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.440]   quite absurd for an annual fee card.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.760]   But in the end, we want to give people something where
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.920]   previously they got nothing.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.320]   I don't know how many people ask you, can they pay their rent with a
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.880]   credit card and you're like, yeah, but the fee's going to, you know,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.400]   wipe away any value that you get.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.880]   Well, I mean, now it's possible.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.560]   So we're really excited about what we've done.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.280]   I've gotten that question plenty of times.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.320]   And the answer is always no, it's never worth it until now.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.520]   So card makes total sense.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.280]   You pay rent, you should have the card.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.680]   What about people who don't pay rent?
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.920]   What about people who own their home?
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.840]   I know a lot of people listening own homes.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.800]   And I get asked 3,748.5 times a day.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.080]   Can I pay my mortgage with this?
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.520]   And the answer so far is not yet.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.240]   There's 109 million renters in the United States, and that is more than
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.640]   enough customers to try and go after for right now, but I, but I want to
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.280]   let everybody know that we've heard the feedback loud and clear, and we
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.480]   would love to make that happen.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.240]   And it's something we talk about regularly, but for now, just your
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.920]   personal rent that you can pay.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.520]   You know, 0, 1, 2, 3 value proposition is the same as chase Sapphire preferred.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.440]   They give us one X points and I'll spend two X on travel and three X on dining,
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.840]   but they charge $95 annual fee and we have the same and some different slash
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.520]   better transfer partners than they do.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.000]   So to everybody that says the chase Sapphire preferred is my go-to card.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.440]   I say, great.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.600]   It's a great card, but why would you not go to our card?
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.400]   But it's no annual fee.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.600]   You're in the same amount of points and have access to American
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.360]   airlines as a transfer partner.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.520]   And it's a good conversation to get back and forth into.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.800]   My motto has really been, we're going to wear you down.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.440]   When we first came out in June, we continue to iterate and
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.760]   make the program better and better.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.280]   I want to hear all the feedback.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.200]   I listened all the time.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.360]   I keep my head to the ground with the formal world.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.360]   I was in to hear what people are saying and the arguments
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.560]   for and against the bill card.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.360]   And we're constantly iterating and we're coming out with some really
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.840]   exciting new things over the next couple of months that it's going
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.360]   to be like resistance is futile.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.400]   Like eventually the quiz is going to be like, okay, like they've worn me down.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.840]   Like I gotta be a part of this and have access to all the great
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.440]   things that the, that the card's doing.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.000]   And you mentioned American, which I think is interesting because I've
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.520]   always had this attitude of, I want to make sure I have points everywhere
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.440]   because if I want to take a trip in a certain place, I want to be able to do it.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.520]   And American's been the hardest to earn points on, in my opinion.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.320]   But there used to be these great offers for American cards.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.440]   And I remember used to be able to sign up for all three in one day
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.120]   and not, and only get one credit check gone, gone, I think are those days.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.920]   And, and then right now with super low interest rates, I've used Basque
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.480]   bank to, to put some money in so that I earn a few American Airlines points each
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   month, but this is interesting because I think the lead value prop might turn
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.560]   some people away for, I don't have rent.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.080]   It is a place where if you want for no annual fee to start earning some points
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.720]   that you can get into American, that's great, but where else can you use them?
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.360]   So we have seven airline, uh, transfer partners, all one-to-one.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.640]   So American Aeroplane, Hawaiian Airlines, Virgin Points, Turkish
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.280]   Miles and Smiles, and Emirates Skywards, uh, as well as Flying Blue.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.800]   And then two hotel partners.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.400]   So we have all three alliances covered plus Emirates, which is not an
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.440]   alliance, but it has a pretty, uh, expansive and global network.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.720]   And then between IHG and Hyatt's pretty much anywhere you go in the world, you
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.840]   could use bill points to book a free hotel night, so really exciting list of
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.520]   transfer partners, and I'm not going to spill any beans, but I'll just let you
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.840]   know, we're never done with that list.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   And we'll, we'll continue working to try and make it, make it
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.360]   more robust and more exciting.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.880]   So you, you mentioned earlier, one of the problems with all these card
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.480]   issuers is that they're doing completely unsustainable things.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.400]   And until the bill card, paying rent with a credit card, any landlord that
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.120]   offered that would just be losing money.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.280]   And, and as a consumer using sites like Plastiq, which would go pay your
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.440]   rent and, and then, you know, you're paying a fee.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.200]   So how is this sustainable?
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Yeah, everybody, everybody asks us, how are you making money?
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.840]   So, um, let's think about all the different revenue streams that we have.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.040]   Number one, we have a credit card, which means we get the interchange.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.760]   Every time you swipe it, people pay interchange for that card.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.120]   And that's how card issuers make money.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.000]   Second, we have our real estate people that are buying bill points to issue
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.240]   to new current prospective residents.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.640]   So it's landlord funded loyalty program on top of interchange.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.520]   And then the aspirational award for us is you can actually redeem bill
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.560]   points for the down payment on a house.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.280]   We can make homeownership a reality for renters.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   And we do that not only by being able to use points for the covering
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.400]   and down payment on a mortgage, but we also report all of your on-time
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.480]   rent payments to all three credit bureaus, which every landlord in the
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.640]   country can do now, but 98% do not because what do they care?
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.720]   There's nothing in it for them.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.440]   And that's going to increase your credit score significantly, which
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.240]   makes you qualify for a much more favorable mortgage and saves you
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.480]   thousands over the course of buying a home.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.280]   Um, and with that comes the ability to be a mortgage originator and the mortgage
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.920]   origination business is huge and a very, um, profitable business to
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.440]   be in if you do it correctly.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.800]   So between the interchange, between being a mortgage originator and between
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.080]   landlords funding the program, this is very sustainable and it's one of the
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.520]   first questions I had for our founder.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.160]   I can dream when I went and met him and heard about this is like, I want to be
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.080]   something that's part of a sustainable business.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.520]   I don't want to be hopping businesses in six months and I don't want to be on the
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.400]   current VC hamster wheel of show growth at all costs, despite if you're losing
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.200]   millions of dollars, you just need to show growth to get to the next round of
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.520]   funding.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.360]   Like I just didn't want to be a part of that personally.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.400]   We did one round of fundraising last year.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.320]   We might do another, but we don't necessarily have to.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.520]   That's a sustainable business model and we're excited about it.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.960]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.760]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes, deals
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.520]   and discounts from our partners.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.800]   You can go to all the hacks.com/deals.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.200]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.280]   So one of the things you guys do that I think is fascinating is I've never seen a
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.600]   bit of content from Amex or Chase or Cap One saying, Hey, here's how to get the
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.760]   most value out of these points.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.280]   I feel like I'm always being pushed to use them in the worst way as possible.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.280]   Hey, you can use your points for this terrible redemption, buy gift cards
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.000]   online, but they're never walking you through how to transfer your points to
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:37.760]   other airlines.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.480]   And I've seen a couple videos you put out saying, Hey, let me walk you through how
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.360]   you could use your points to get to Europe for almost nothing.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.480]   That's one example, but I'd love if you can share how should people do this?
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.680]   What is the advice you give to your cardholders on how to maximize points
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.520]   with so many transfer partners that the average person doesn't want to log onto
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.760]   all seven sites and say, okay, you know, what's it cost if I use this person or
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.880]   this airline, or if I transfer to Flying Blue, then I book on Delta.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.480]   It's, it's a tough game that, you know, I used to tell people you could sign up for
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.280]   all these paid services, or you can go one by one.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.800]   Is there an easy answer that you have for people?
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.040]   The easy answer is unfortunately, no, but we're trying hard.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.920]   So we've done a couple of things.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.120]   Like you mentioned, if you go into our app, there's a flights tab where I've curated a
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.440]   bunch of content that's separated out by airline.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.360]   It says, if you want to fly this airline, whether it's a partner of ours or not,
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.360]   click on that tile that we have in our app.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.080]   And I've very quickly with screenshots showing you how to fly it.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.160]   So JetBlue is not a transfer partner of ours, but you can fly in
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.600]   with BuiltPoints through Emirates.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.560]   If you want to fly JetBlue, click on the JetBlue tile.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.120]   And very quickly, I tell you how to do that.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.240]   The next thing we've done is we have a real-time award search functionality
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.360]   in the BuiltRewards app now.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.480]   Right now we have American and AeroPlan on it.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.000]   So if you search any route in the world, it will instantly show you
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.400]   both AeroPlan and American results.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.160]   All you have to do is tab between them in the app and we're working hard to get
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.760]   our other partners involved in that.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.960]   So that's an easy way to do one search and see at least Star Alliance in one
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.360]   world availability as quick as you can.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.840]   But the end result of all of this and basically everything we've talked about
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.360]   today is if you want something really good, it's going to take a little bit of
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.200]   effort and what my job is, and one of them is to make that effort minimal, but
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.960]   it is going to take some effort.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.440]   Um, so through the content, through the videos that we're putting out and through
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.360]   this new real-time award availability search, we feel like we're on the right
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.640]   path and again, for being less than a year old.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.680]   And as you said, nobody other, nobody else is trying to educate their
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.520]   members on how to maximize points.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.200]   We feel like we're in a good spot and we're on the right path to making it easy.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.360]   And can people do that in your app and search American and AeroPlan availability
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.400]   if they don't have the card, is that something anyone can do?
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.640]   Again, anybody can download the Built Rewards app and read all of our content,
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.760]   but you will have to join in order to get the logged in experience, but all of the
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.000]   content and that search feature is available if you're not logged in and
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.120]   you haven't created an account.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.680]   So we just want to be a resource.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.560]   So whether you're like, I'm not a renter, but this sounds interesting, or I want to
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.000]   learn how to use these programs, like download the Built Rewards app and take
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.040]   a look at all the content and tools that we've created there.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.760]   And you've been in this space a long time outside of the Built Rewards app.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.240]   If someone comes to you and says, "God, I got all these Amex and Chase points."
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.760]   What's your advice to them on how to, how to not get stuck redeeming
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.080]   them at, at terrible valuations?
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.600]   Yeah, there's some new technology coming out.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.200]   This one that you, you brought it out to me, card pointers.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.160]   I feel like there, there are dozens of people out there making great
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.840]   products to make all of this simpler.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.040]   Some of the ones I'd recommend, the Card Curator app is a great one that'll guide
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.360]   you in how to do these points in a simple process, Max Rewards is another
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.320]   product out there that's helping folks make this simpler, and then there's some
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.400]   new technology not released yet that I'm excited about probably in the next six
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.120]   months that will be public facing that will basically tell you in real time,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.360]   "Hey, this is how you can use your points to go where you want to go."
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.840]   And you just tell them what points you have.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.000]   So the easy answer is to go check out some of these technologies
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.840]   that I've just mentioned.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.440]   Um, the hard answer is go to Google and search best way to use X points.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   And I'm sure the points guy article that maybe I wrote will be at the top of the
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:08.400]   search results, uh, giving you step-by-step breakdown, but again, probably just like
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.680]   you, when you have friends and family ask you these questions and you try and make
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.640]   it as simple as possible, you can tell pretty quick if their eyes glass over in
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.600]   three seconds, you're like, I'm going to go ahead and stop, or some people they
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.720]   light up and they go, wait, there really is something here.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.520]   This is not a multi-level marketing scheme.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.440]   Like this is something I can get excited about.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.080]   I think that's a lot of people listening here.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.360]   Hey everybody.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.920]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with point.me, my favorite
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.760]   award search tool to give you a special offer of only $1 for your first month of
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:41.840]   their standard plan, if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and use the promo
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:49.760]   code HACKS, again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E or find the link in the show
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.600]   notes, so definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.640]   Do you have, you know, favorite redemptions right now?
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.000]   Things that, you know, despite all the devaluations and dynamic pricing that are
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.120]   just these sweet spots and in the award charts.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.840]   A hundred percent.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.680]   Turkish miles and smiles to fly United specifically to Hawaii for 7,500 miles.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.880]   That's 7,500 bill points or city.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.160]   Thank you.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.320]   Points transferred to Turkish.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.240]   You can go to Hawaii and then you can fly Turkish themselves, which is an amazing
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.600]   product to Istanbul, like 33,000 points in business class from the East coast to
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.400]   Turkey out of all their destinations.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.760]   If you have slept on the Turkish miles and smiles program, now's the time to
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.200]   wake up and either fly United or fly Turkish with it, beyond that American
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.400]   web specials, the Delta flash sales.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.640]   If you don't have that page bookmarked that they update all the time, just
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.360]   really great domestic and international deals all the time, probably be the top
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.240]   three that I would tell folks that are most relevant that they need to check out.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.920]   Any good deals on Emirates for people who have been eyeing that
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.440]   Emirates first-class experience?
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.800]   Back in the days of when Alaska charged very reasonable, um,
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.120]   amounts of miles to fly them.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   It was a lot easier.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:00.760]   Now it's just going to cost you a lot to skywards credit.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.680]   They eliminated fuel surcharges, which took the program out of complete
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.800]   irrelevancy to now a very relevant program.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.560]   If you want to do Emirates first-class taking their fifth freedoms from Newark
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.800]   and JFK to Milan and Athens, it's going to be your best bet to do that under
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.960]   200,000, uh, skywards miles, uh, or transfer from chase or transfer from
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.080]   AmEx or transfer from built to make that round trip, um, it's going to be your
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.760]   best bets.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.120]   The other only thing I'll say about that is sometimes Qantas can be a little bit
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.000]   better of a deal, charge a little bit fewer points and you can transfer city
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.600]   over to Qantas and take advantage of that.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.920]   All right.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.440]   And any best redemption stories from your end?
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.560]   I got a lot.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.280]   My very first trip, believe it or not, 2010, when United has favorable award
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.320]   routing rules that we call stopovers and open jaws, my wife and I flew around the
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.680]   world and business in first class for 110,000 United miles by piecing together
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.920]   all of their, again, the routing rules.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:57.440]   We did Seattle to Hawaii, to Tokyo, to Seoul, to Frankfurt, and then back to
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.560]   Seattle and love stands, uh, first class and United business class in Asia and a
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.360]   first class.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.720]   And it was just fantastic.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.960]   Yes.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.720]   And, and what, what you're talking about for anyone who doesn't know, a lot of
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:14.760]   airlines have these rules where if you want to fly, you can add a stopover or
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.000]   you can change where you're going to and coming from.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.320]   So you could book instead of a round trip ticket from San Francisco to Frankfurt
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.840]   and back, you could go to Frankfurt and fly back from, you know, Milan, or you
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.120]   can stop over on your way there.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.600]   And sometimes you can, not every airline still has these, you know, kind of great
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.120]   rules, but some of them do still, I don't know if you remember which ones do now,
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.520]   but you can still take advantage of them.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.960]   You can add stopovers to an airplane ticket for 5,000 airplane points.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.440]   Airplane is their newly redesigned.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.840]   One of those programs that's headed in the right direction and just did a
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.600]   fantastic job in the redesign.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.760]   If you're not familiar with the ins and outs, we're familiar at all with
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.560]   aeroplane, please go read up on that.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.120]   Great articles out there explaining how you can get just tons of value by seeing
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.720]   multiple destinations on one ticket, by using stopovers and open draws.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.480]   It's fantastic.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:05.280]   And they're transfer partners of you got chase and built and American express.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.160]   So a lot of options to get in there.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.840]   A lot of people always tell me, gosh, Amex doesn't go to United and I like to fly
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.480]   United and I'm like, Ooh, they go to aeroplane, the airplanes got United
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.040]   inventory.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.280]   So don't forget that if you have a card that has access to an Alliance, it's not
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:20.920]   always perfect.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.520]   Sometimes you might rather have American points than British airways points, but
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.560]   you can use BA to book on American.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.200]   And, and sometimes for, I don't know if it's still the case, but BA used to be so
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.640]   good for these short flights.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   They devalue just a little bit, but if the availability is there, it's still a
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.000]   great deal.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:35.720]   A hundred percent.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.480]   Cool.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.440]   Quick few things before we go.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.560]   Travel hacks, like outside of award booking, you've been to dozens of
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.040]   countries.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.480]   I don't, I don't know how big the list is at this point, but what have you picked up
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.600]   both on the traveling?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   When you get to places, what are your favorite hacks?
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:56.640]   Yeah, it all pretty much revolves around the practical is what I like to tell
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.240]   people because there are all kinds of advanced things I get in the weeds, but
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.240]   the practical things of like, how do I get cash?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.720]   Where do I do the exchange with getting screwed on the exchange rate?
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.840]   So I'll tell you what to do.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.200]   I have USA checking account.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.200]   You can, if you don't qualify for USA through military, you can use the Schwab.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:15.720]   I go to a bank ATM in the country and pull out cash in the local currency.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.800]   And that way it uses my bank's exchange rate, which is going to be fair.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.440]   And it avoids all the shenanigans of exchanging cash at a desk or
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.600]   with one of these airport folks.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.360]   And I do not use the bank or the ATM at the airport.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:31.200]   I always go to the hotel and then find the most local or closest ATM, use my ATM
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.520]   card and pull out cash there.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.880]   It's the best way to get cash.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.160]   The second practical travel hack or piece of advice is a
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.440]   dynamic currency conversion, DCC.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.720]   This occurs when you go to check out of your hotel in a foreign country.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.520]   And it says, Hey, do you want to use us dollars?
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.520]   Or do you want to use our local currency?
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.280]   And most Americans go off sweet.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.120]   I'll just do dollars.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.400]   Cause I know how much that is.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.360]   Don't do that.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.960]   Always charge and local currency, because what they do is they use
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.320]   a very unfavorable exchange rate.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.240]   They end up charging you in the local currency anyways, and then your
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.840]   bank exchange rate gets you again.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.920]   So they make like on the order of magnitude of 10% worse than what
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.600]   the actual market exchange rate is.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.920]   So always select that local currency.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.720]   If you're at a restaurant or if you're checking out of a
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.920]   hotel in a foreign country.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.120]   Now it's called the dynamic currency conversion.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:22.760]   I don't want to say it's a scam, but it is a revenue center to do that.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   It's always local currency.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.000]   Anything else when you get to a city, how you make sure
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.040]   you have the best experience?
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.000]   One of the amazing things about the points and miles community
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.400]   is pretty much everywhere you go.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.960]   Somebody is either there that's happy to help you, or somebody has
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.920]   detailed explanations of how they did it, things to see and things to avoid.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.520]   So just after so many years in the community, you're very lucky that
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.400]   there's forums and places to put out a, Hey, help me post in again.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.720]   People would jump to the rescue.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.000]   The biggest hack for that is become a part of this community.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.920]   There are multiple Facebook groups that you can go and join is
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.160]   where I would tell you to start.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.360]   Go and check out the travel on points.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.760]   Go and check out miles to memories, Facebook group, the
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.280]   frequent miler Facebook group.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.360]   If you're not on Facebook, you can head to the Reddit
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.520]   community, Reddit credit cards.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.320]   It's a great place to go and check out and meet folks and then flyer talk.com.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   So the best way I do that is literally go into one of these communities
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.000]   and saying either searching for that city and somebody's written up a
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.440]   detailed, awesome experience or asking, Hey, I'm going to be going here.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.400]   Does anybody have any tips?
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.040]   And people are more than willing to help out.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.480]   That's the typical strategy.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.920]   I'm in a lot of those communities too.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.400]   And, and we're going to be kicking one off for, for all the
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.440]   hacks here sometime in 2022.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.760]   You mentioned a lot of forums.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.240]   What about any, any blogs that you love people, people in the
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.000]   community that others should follow?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.280]   Yeah, a hundred percent.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.480]   We, we mentioned Gary earlier.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.360]   He's a borderline savant when it comes to the travel and loyalty
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.160]   industry, like literally from a nuts and bolts perspective, you really
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.160]   want to understand the inner workings of these things.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.240]   You need to go and read view from over by Gary.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.120]   And if you're just a crazy points and miles, I want to extract maximum value
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.480]   of earning and redeeming points, a Greg and Nick over at the frequent
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.680]   miler is a daily must read.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.120]   And then, uh, somebody that kind of takes, uh, a little bit of storytelling
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.520]   along with the, the nuts and bolts that are the folks over miles to
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.840]   memories that you got to follow.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.920]   So between those three sites, you're pretty much going to get everything
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.400]   that you need on a daily basis.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.640]   And really the boarding area network as a whole of which these bloggers
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.240]   all belong to the same network boarding area.com.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Just get plugged in, spend a little bit of time.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.120]   Don't get overwhelmed.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   Read something that catches your interest.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.800]   And sure enough, I, you'll be down that rabbit hole with
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.840]   the rest of us in no time.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.400]   I'll link to all those in the show notes.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.520]   You mentioned some hacks that just broadly for, for cities.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.440]   What about your hometown?
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.240]   You live in Atlanta.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:37.920]   I'm curious.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.640]   What do you, what would you tell someone listening?
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.480]   Who's taking their first trip to Atlanta that they should make
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.640]   sure they check off the list.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:48.560]   Besides checking out a world champion, Atlanta Braves baseball game, which
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.120]   I always recommend up at the new stadium.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.160]   It's a great time, Atlanta, I would say five years ago as a place where
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.200]   people said, Hey, I want to come to a weekend trip in Atlanta.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.480]   I would've been like, eh, probably not.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.240]   Like it's just not a weekend spot to do, but Atlanta has done a great
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.360]   job of turning itself around the food scene, the revitalization of
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.960]   places like underground Atlanta.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.360]   The pond city market are great places to check out.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.480]   We have everything Martin Luther King and the civil rights site and museum to go.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.960]   I mean, those sites to see, we have the largest aquarium in the world, the
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.880]   world of Coca-Cola, the college football hall of fame, like it's all right down
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.280]   there and plenty of things to go and see.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   So those are some of the top attractions that I think it's worthwhile.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   And as far as the eats go every week, a new restaurants popping up in Atlanta.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.260]   That's the new hottest upcoming chef.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:37.160]   Also the Georgia film industry has completely taken off outside of LA.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:41.760]   Georgia is now the number two spot in the country for doing a movie and TV show.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.280]   There's always celebrities in town filming something to places booming, man.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.980]   Um, so I would go and check it out to a favorite restaurants.
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.300]   Marcel is a French restaurant, please make reservations far in advance.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.720]   You want to go check that out and bring your significant other
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.600]   there for a great night.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.320]   And then, uh, Yebo beach house, Y E B O up in the city of Buckhead
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.580]   where all the brand new hotels, the Thompson Buck has just opened.
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.440]   The Hyatt centric Buck has just opened the Yebo beach house, go and get some
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.680]   amazing South African fair there.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.920]   And you can actually walk there from the new Thompson hotel.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.940]   It's going to be a great evening.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.360]   So Atlanta on the up and up, man, we're excited.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:15.880]   Awesome.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.280]   This has been fantastic.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.020]   I'm sure there's going to be some questions out of this.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.980]   We might have to have to bring you back on or, or do a follow-up, but where can
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.180]   people find everything you're working on online?
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.280]   Yeah, of course.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.040]   Again, download the built rewards app and check out everything we're doing there.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.100]   But you can find me at Kerr points.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.980]   K E R R on Instagram and Twitter is where I am most active.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:39.120]   Love to hear the feedback great, bad, and ugly about built rewards.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.260]   But also I talk points and miles and travel 24, seven, and
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.060]   I post my travel adventures.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.740]   That sounds great.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.920]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.260]   My absolute pleasure, man.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:48.620]   Thanks.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.480]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.940]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.260]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.500]   Apple podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:04.460]   Especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.180]   And if you have any feedback on the show questions for me, or just want to say,
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:12.720]   hi, I'm Chris at all the hacks.com or at Hutchins on Twitter.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.980]   That's it for this week.

[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:16.260]   Bye.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:22.380]   Yeah.
