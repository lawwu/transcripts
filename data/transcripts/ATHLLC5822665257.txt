[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.680]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.880]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.920]   and today we're gonna talk about financial independence
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.160]   and the intricacies of the financial independence
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.320]   retire early or FIRE movement and its evolution.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.820]   We're gonna delve into forms of FIRE
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.080]   like lean FIRE, fat FIRE, or coast FIRE,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.400]   which it turns out isn't what I actually thought it was
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.600]   and is actually pretty close
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800]   to how Amy and I are living our lives.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.580]   We're also gonna talk about the implications
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.880]   of the 4% rule, strategies for effective investing
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   and retirement planning,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.400]   the psychological aspects of financial decision-making,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700]   and some of the tools that can aid in tracking
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400]   and managing your finances.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   And who better to join me for this episode
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.040]   than Brad Barrett, a three-time All The Hacks guest
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.560]   and host of the number one
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.360]   financial independence podcast, Choose FI.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.160]   Brad is a wealth of knowledge here,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.120]   and if you haven't already listened to Choose FI,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.600]   you absolutely should.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.520]   And not just because I've been a guest a few times,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   but because it's an incredible podcast
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.060]   and I am pretty sure he has an entire episode
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.240]   to cover just about every financial independence topic
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   you can think of.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.280]   But that's enough intro, we have a lot to cover,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.600]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.760]   You don't have to lose track of healthy eating habits
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.940]   during the holidays.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.260]   In fact, delicious and nutritious food
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.160]   can actually be so easy.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.960]   I know because we've cooked over 50 meals
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.360]   from Green Chef this year,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.200]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.440]   for this episode.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.560]   In fact, last week,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080]   we wanted to automate all our healthy dinners
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.480]   and just ordered Green Chef
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480]   for all seven nights of the week, and it was amazing.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.520]   And just to be clear,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.480]   I'm paying full price for all these meals
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.440]   and have no plans to stop.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.840]   They are really that good.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.400]   And I love that not only do Green Chef meal kits
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.560]   make eating well so easy,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.360]   but also Green Chef focuses on unique and exciting flavors
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.020]   with recipes that feature certified organic fruits
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.640]   and vegetables, sustainably sourced seafood,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.040]   and unique farm fresh ingredients.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.460]   Some highlights from last week
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.680]   were the burrita style black bean tacos
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.000]   and the pork chops with truffle sauce.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.280]   Seriously, I have never seen my kids and my wife
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.000]   literally lick their plates clean until that meal.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.800]   If you see either of those, definitely check them out.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   And right now, every Green Chef customer
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.400]   gets a free session with one of their registered dieticians
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   who can walk you through
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.680]   how to make clean eating work for you.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.640]   For Green Chef's best deal of the year,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.540]   get $250 off with code ALLTHEHACKS250
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.040]   or at allthehacks.com/greenchef.

[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.040]   to get $250 off the number one meal kit for eating clean.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.020]   Brad, thanks for joining me again.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.220]   - Yeah, man, this should be fun.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.220]   I always love chatting with you, whether online or off.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.960]   - We did our first conversation,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.580]   well, first one was many years ago on your podcast.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.840]   You first joined me for what became episode two
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.600]   of "All the Hacks," and then we did it again
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.840]   for episode 100.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.440]   And we talked a little bit about fire at the beginning,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.920]   but both you and I have had an evolution of perspective
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.280]   on financial independence.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.920]   So much so that in researching this episode,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.320]   I found out that I didn't even know what coast fire was.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.660]   And it turns out that's actually the thing
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.880]   I'm probably most in tuned with myself.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.360]   So lots of stuff to talk about when it comes
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360]   to financial independence
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.080]   and how our perspectives have changed.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.440]   - Going way back to episode 71 on ChooseFI.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.160]   So that was almost six years ago when we recorded this.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.000]   Unquestionably, both of our perspectives have changed
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   for the better in a lot of senses
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.560]   and changed for the healthier.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.080]   Both of us probably veered a little bit too much
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.480]   towards the frugality and over-optimizing
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.360]   at the expense of enjoyment of life sometimes.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   There's been an evolution, certainly for both of us,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.680]   but in greater financial independence world.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.120]   This is one of the very few things
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.560]   that I will pat ourselves on the back for at ChooseFI.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.320]   We have really been the center of the fi world
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.000]   for the last handful of years.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.640]   And we have made this very strongly anti miserliness.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.120]   The let's race to some number at the expense of life.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.400]   We've tried really hard to make it about,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.040]   hey, what are you running towards?
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   Not what are you running away from?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.960]   That little shift in orientation has made a big difference
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.040]   in a lot of people's lives.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.560]   - For anyone who didn't listen to the hundreds of episodes
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.280]   you've done, the few we've done,
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.440]   hasn't ever introduced themselves to FIRE,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.960]   which will maybe only be a few people.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.720]   So briefly, since you're the pro,
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.000]   how would you just define financial independence
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.440]   and the difference between financial independence and FIRE?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.280]   - That's a great question.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.160]   FIRE, the definition, financial independence, retire early.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.440]   That was en vogue five to 10 years ago.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.400]   There's an allure to it.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.600]   And frankly, Chris, that cute little acronym,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.960]   FIRE just sounds cool.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.240]   Hey, I'm pursuing FIRE.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.880]   But honestly, there are just people
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.360]   who love to rip on the FIRE movement
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.680]   because all they hear is that R-E.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.240]   It really takes away from people
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.480]   who are pursuing financial independence
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.560]   to live a better life.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.160]   I see financial independence as a universal good
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   in that people are wresting control of their lives back
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.840]   from this elusive they.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.560]   You always hear the doom and gloom of,
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.600]   you can never retire, it's impossible.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.320]   You need 10 to $20 million to retire.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.760]   Healthcare is gonna be unaffordable.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.720]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.120]   You can't do this, you can't do this.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.960]   It's impossible.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.200]   As opposed to reorienting around what can you control?
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.440]   And you, to a large degree, can control your expenses.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.640]   And now again, this is probably
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.480]   where people overemphasize just the cutting.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.040]   But you can control what does your life cost?
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.680]   And then essentially, you can take
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.440]   what does my life cost per year
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.000]   and then multiply it by some number.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.760]   It's usually by 25.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.240]   So let's say your life costs $80,000 a year.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.800]   Multiply by 25, that's $2 million.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.560]   That's your FIRE number,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.160]   your financial independence number.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.240]   Most of us have heard of the 4% rule.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.440]   We're not gonna get into this really in depth here today,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   but in essence, you can pull 4%
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   out of your investable assets.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.040]   So again, we'll turn it around
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.760]   and say that $2 million times 0.04 is $80,000, right?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   So it's just the inverse of where we started
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.560]   at 80,000 for the expenses.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.640]   So that $2 million can spit off 80K
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.200]   to cover your living expenses.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.320]   Now, it is indexed for inflation, normal inflation,
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.160]   not the inflation we've seen recently.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.240]   So there are some potential adjustments,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.520]   but some people say,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.920]   "Okay, maybe I want to be a little more conservative
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.000]   "and make it 30 times my expenses
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.080]   "or 33 times," something like that.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.960]   You can play with this at the margins
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.600]   because really the essence of it
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.920]   is you actually have some degree of certainty
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.440]   and you have something to shoot for,
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   maybe for the first time in your life.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.840]   And it's not just this doom and gloom of,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.960]   "Oh, you can never do this.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.080]   "You can never do that.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.440]   "There's some elusive day that's gonna impact you."
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   You can control that.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.280]   I will come back at some point to the 4% rule
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.120]   'cause I have some thoughts.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.040]   When I think about financial independence on one perspective,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   it doesn't even have to get that detailed.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.320]   You could have a large emergency fund
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.520]   and that's a form of financial independence
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   because it gives you time to look for the right job.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.720]   Every bit of savings that gives you some flexibility
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.760]   is layering in financial independence.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440]   And sure, when you get to the point
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.800]   that your savings can cover your entire life
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.840]   and you can choose not to work for free,
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.120]   obviously that's even more independence.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.680]   And if you truly could replace your entire income,
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.840]   then yeah, you could retire early per se.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.720]   The irony is that most people end up using their free time
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.040]   to do things that very much resemble work
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.840]   and very often generate income
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.640]   and they're not truly retiring early.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.480]   But I think that's why it's actually helpful.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.040]   As much as I thought it was confusing
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.320]   that there are many different types of fire,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.840]   it was actually helpful to look at them
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.360]   and talk about what they are
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.800]   because it gave some perspective to the concept
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.680]   that it's not all about one particular style,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.040]   which I think historically it has been.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.840]   It's always been saving up money
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.560]   so you have 25 times your income
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.000]   and don't think about anything else.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.840]   - I think you're spot on.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.920]   That's exactly right.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.760]   And that is why that caricature existed.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.480]   This was for a very specific type of person
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.440]   is what it seemed like.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.680]   High income, maybe in a tech job,
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.720]   maybe a white guy in his 30s, right?
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.960]   Because some of the very famous early fire bloggers,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.280]   I guess, fit that caricature.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.520]   So I agree with you that A, nobody that I know of
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.160]   actually just sits on their butt and retires
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.280]   and doesn't do anything.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.040]   Most people, if they had the wherewithal
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.640]   to reach financial independence
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.320]   at some fairly early point,
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.360]   they are going to do fantastic things.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.920]   Like you said, they're going to earn money somehow.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.440]   They're going to add value to the world.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.240]   They're going to do interesting and varied things.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.720]   And to imagine this again,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.440]   you can tell I get bothered by this, right?
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.280]   They're just going to sit there and do nothing
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.520]   and sip umbrella drinks.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.920]   It's just so silly and laughable,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.760]   which is why to focus on the RE makes no sense.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.680]   And then like you said,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   the power starts accruing essentially from day one.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.360]   That first time, if you're living paycheck to paycheck
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.800]   and you're now, all of a sudden,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.520]   you found out about choose a FI
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.200]   and you're pursuing financial independence.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.640]   Okay, maybe it's not going to take you 10 years
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.480]   to get to FI.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   Maybe it's going to take you 20 years.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.440]   Maybe it's going to take you how many ever years?
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.480]   It almost doesn't even matter.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.600]   But your life is vastly better
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.000]   that first time you have $5,000 saved up, even $1,000.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.600]   How many people live paycheck to paycheck
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.320]   and think that an emergency is a $200 expense
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.400]   that came out of the blue,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.080]   but was perfectly foreseeable in a given year.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.840]   But that to them is an emergency, but it's really not.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.800]   Life is lumpy.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.840]   Expenses are lumpy.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.720]   That's the way it works.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.480]   But man, that first time they have a thousand bucks
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.960]   saved up, $5,000 saved up,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.560]   their life is dramatically better.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.480]   The FI journey starts from day one
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.200]   and that power starts accruing from day one.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   It really radically transforms people
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   and their entire mindset.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.200]   - A handful of people I knew, myself included,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.720]   probably went off the deep end
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.800]   with one version of it in our minds.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.120]   There's an unlimited number
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.640]   of types of financial independence.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.000]   There are ones that I will leave off
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.040]   and maybe they're ones you're excited about,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.800]   but I'm just gonna share a few of the ones.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.840]   I wrote down a couple quick definitions
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.000]   because having a few options
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.960]   of what financial independence could be
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.680]   actually gives you more flexibility.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.040]   So the one we talked about,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.720]   just traditional fire is have enough money
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.240]   to quit your job and never work again.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.880]   But the other four are pretty interesting.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.160]   So I'm gonna talk about first with lean fire,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.240]   which would be the very tight end of the spectrum,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.640]   which is retiring early,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   but bringing your expectation for expenses way down,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.160]   really tightening your belt
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.800]   so that you can do it even earlier.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.560]   And I would say this one probably gets a lot more flack
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.080]   than practically shows up,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.360]   but this is, I am going to change where I live,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.920]   change what I eat, change the activities I do
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.360]   so I can stop working.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.800]   The next one, which is interesting, is coast fire.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.840]   And it's most interesting to me
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.000]   because I didn't really actually understand what it meant.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.360]   I thought it was a version of fire
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.000]   for people who live on the coasts
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.480]   where cost of living is higher.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.080]   But it turns out it's actually,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.760]   instead of focusing on saving up enough money
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.880]   so that you can stop working,
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.480]   it's saving up enough money
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.800]   so that you can stop contributing towards retirement,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.080]   whatever time in the future that might be.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.040]   So let's say you're fine working till you're 65,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.600]   fill up your retirement accounts enough early on
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.160]   so that all of your income each year
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.920]   can just go to life and not go towards savings,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.720]   which dovetails into another option,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.160]   which is called barista fire,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.520]   which is you could choose to make a lot of money
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.560]   and spend a lot of money,
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.080]   or you could choose to just have a side job
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.840]   that only covers the expenses
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.680]   because you don't need to contribute to your savings.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.400]   And so you could take a less stressful job,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.240]   you could take a job that earns less income.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.160]   And by the way, this is all a spectrum, right?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.000]   If in order to meet your retirement needs,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.040]   you need to save $30,000 a year,
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.800]   it's not zero or 30, there's stops along the way.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.720]   And then the last one that I'll mention is fat fire,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.080]   which has a wonderful Reddit community and Facebook group,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.200]   which is really just not sacrificing.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.720]   I would like to save up enough money
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.520]   so that I'm not beholden to a job,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.120]   I'm not beholden to anything,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   but I don't wanna sacrifice.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   I wanna be able to go on really nice vacations.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.320]   I wanna be able to travel around the world,
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.240]   eat at whatever restaurants I want to,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.160]   and spend money and live in a nice house
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.720]   and choose to live in the Bay Area,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.040]   even if I'm not working or wherever it is for you.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.080]   So I wanna live whatever life I want on my savings
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.440]   and not stress out about it.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.840]   And I don't know, I'm curious what you think
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.200]   when you hear all of these things,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.440]   whether you're like, this is silly, this is helpful.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.360]   - I think it's helpful.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.680]   I think it's mostly helpful.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.880]   And like you said, there are a lot of these different ones.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.360]   I think these are the four probably main ones
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200]   that I've heard of.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.640]   I suspect there are some that you and I
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.040]   have never even heard of at this point.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.400]   But like you said, lean fire is probably the one
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.920]   that appeals to me least,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.480]   but I suspect it's maybe,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.360]   essentially how little could you humanly spend
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.160]   more or less to live?
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.760]   And then have you achieved PHI
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.960]   based on probably the 25 times rule based on that?
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.640]   So let's say your actual structural expenses
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.920]   and some food to get by cost $30,000.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.760]   Well, okay, then your lean PHI is 750,000,
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.080]   which is very doable for a lot of people.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.200]   Chris, I can't imagine that sounds like a very appealing
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.520]   life to either me or you,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.720]   but I can understand why people potentially pursue this.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.920]   - What I think is interesting,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   and it's something I've actually said a lot,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.080]   and I guess maybe I've been bribing lean fire,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.880]   is that it's helpful for me to have the security
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.680]   to know that I've saved enough money,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.000]   that there is a lifestyle I could live,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.160]   especially once you have a family and children.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.440]   If you have that $750,000 and something happens,
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.480]   you lose your ability to work.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.000]   Knowing that there is a place in the world
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.320]   that you could live,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.400]   maybe even in the US, maybe even nearby,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.680]   there is a ability to buy food, feed your family.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.160]   That's a lot of security.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.880]   It gives you the flexibility to do a lot of things
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.920]   in your life and be a lot less worried.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   Now, it's not enough money to live in a major city
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.020]   and go out and take expensive vacations,
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.880]   but it will give you some peace of mind.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.240]   The challenge is, when you get to the point that you hit it,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.720]   do you really want to stop,
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.160]   do nothing for the rest of your life,
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.040]   and live that life or keep going?
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.440]   It starts with being out of debt,
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.880]   building up savings and whatnot,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.240]   but I think what I've seen in my life,
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.440]   leaving to start this podcast,
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.160]   my wife leaving to join me,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.840]   those were things we were able to do
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.200]   because we have savings.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.440]   Do we have enough savings that we could live off of it
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.600]   in our current lifestyle with zero income?
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.200]   Probably not, but do we have enough savings
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.760]   that we could adapt our lifestyle,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.120]   move somewhere else and live off it?
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.000]   Yes, and that gives us a lot of comfort.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.680]   Security, there's a real allure to that, certainly,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.480]   and I don't think any of these are all or nothing,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.160]   especially something like LeanFi.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.760]   I can use the example of my brother and his wife and family.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.240]   Maybe you could call it a mini-retirement,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.720]   but there's some intersection of a mini-retirement
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.520]   and LeanFi in that they just had a daughter
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.640]   and she's a year old now,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.640]   and basically, he was staying home
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.140]   to raise her for the first year,
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.880]   and then his wife Kristen realized,
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.360]   hey, I don't want to miss this time.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.880]   This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.760]   We're not at fi, but we're certainly at a LeanFi number
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.920]   where we could easily live off the 4% rule
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.120]   based on earning zero income.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.520]   So they wound up almost doing
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.080]   exactly what you described, Chris,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.120]   which was, hey, maybe you could even do this
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.440]   within the United States.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.600]   They moved to Wisconsin, where she's from.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.520]   They bought a condo, don't have a mortgage on it,
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.200]   and they're living for a year or two
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.360]   or maybe even more in this LeanFi style,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.760]   but the benefit they're getting
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.880]   is they're seeing those first formative years
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.800]   of their daughter's life as a family,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.840]   and the three of them are there every single day.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.080]   You talk about security,
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.800]   but you also talk about benefits of something.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   That is literally priceless,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.920]   and I mean, I don't know precisely
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.820]   what's going on in their lives,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.640]   but are they going out to fancy dinners all the time?
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.800]   Are they doing this and that?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.900]   Like, no, but they're there with their daughter
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.400]   every single day, and that's an astonishing thing.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.960]   - If you've been listening to this podcast for a while,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.480]   you know I'm a huge fan of our sponsor today,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.400]   Daffy, your one-stop shop for all your charitable giving.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.800]   Daffy is a platform and app that helps regular folks
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.560]   like you and me manage giving
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.400]   to the charities we care about more efficiently,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.300]   and they do that by helping you set up
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.280]   a special tax-advantaged account
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.760]   called the Donor Advised Fund, or DAF,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.480]   to set money aside for charity,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.720]   have it invested, and give on your own timeline.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.580]   In addition to making it way easier
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.880]   to be strategic about your charitable giving
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.600]   and give appreciated assets like stocks,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.280]   index funds, or crypto,
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.800]   Daffy just launched a new feature called Daffy Campaigns,
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.600]   which helps anyone set up a fundraiser
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.220]   for any charity or even multiple charities in seconds.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.440]   So if you're planning to give or raise funds
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.000]   for any charities, schools,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.120]   or faith-based organizations this holiday season,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.400]   definitely check out Daffy for all your giving needs.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.760]   Head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy,

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.260]   for a better way to give.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.760]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.440]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy,
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.120]   and even if you've already filed,
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.600]   being proactive about this year
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.280]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.960]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.120]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.440]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes,
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.000]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.600]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.040]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.640]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.480]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.200]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.440]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.360]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.440]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.680]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.440]   open communication with your team
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.360]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.680]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.880]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.160]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.240]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.760]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.560]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made,
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.440]   so they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.320]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.920]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.800]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.280]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.120]   Just head to allthehacks.com/gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.680]   I think you could choose what you want
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.080]   to do with your financial independence.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.400]   You can choose how it exists.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.640]   Let's come back to Coast 5
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.400]   because it's the most interesting one to me
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.800]   because it feels like what I'm interested in
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.560]   and what I actually would care about
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.520]   more than quitting my job is having the flexibility to work,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.680]   but also save.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.800]   I'm curious what you think.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.640]   - It's funny, actually,
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.960]   that today is the day you found Coast 5
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   and you realized, "Oh, wow, this is interesting to me.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.120]   "This is what I'm living."
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.920]   This has a real appeal to a lot of people.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.000]   This is maybe one of the newer of these flavors of 5,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.520]   but it was one of those aha moments for a lot of people.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.040]   There's the intersection of the rule of 72
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.520]   and compounding money.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.640]   So a quick sidebar and explain that is
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.280]   I think most people understand that,
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.160]   okay, you have some investable net worth saved up, right?
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.120]   And while we can't guarantee what a stock market return is,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.360]   you have a general annual return over a long period of time.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.000]   We generally say 8%.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.520]   We use that as the back of the envelope.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.720]   So using what's known as the rule of 72,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.800]   and I don't wanna get in the weeds here,
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.680]   but this is actually a really useful
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.320]   and pretty easy thing to figure out,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.360]   is it basically tells you how long it'll take
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.000]   for your assets to double based on a certain rate of return.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.960]   So more or less, you just take the number 72
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.240]   and then divide by your expected rate of return.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.680]   If we're saying 8%, so 72 divided by eight,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.920]   very simply is nine,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.440]   that's the number of years it'll take your money to double.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.720]   So that's really, really important for Coase FI.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.440]   Basically how Coase FI works is,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.040]   let's say you've saved up, I don't know, 300,000.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.880]   Let's start there.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.120]   Something that's reasonable
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.600]   and is certainly a nice net worth,
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.480]   but is not gonna get just about anybody to FI, right?
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.360]   So you've saved up 300 grand
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.720]   and now you want to not save any more money.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   So that's the point where Coasting comes in
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.720]   is essentially your money is working for you
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   in the background and you are not adding anything
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.320]   to those assets, you're not saving.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   You are either earning less and spending it all
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.920]   or potentially spending more money
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.960]   and increasing your lifestyle to meet where your income is.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.840]   So either way, not a bad option.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.200]   Basically using that rule of 72,
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.640]   let's say your actual FI number was, I don't know,
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.720]   1.2 million, just to make the math easy.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   So that 300,000 will double to 600,000 in nine years
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.880]   and then that 600 will double again
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.720]   to 1.2 million in 18 years total.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.080]   So 18 years from now, if you had a $300,000 net worth,
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.240]   again, in theory, we're not saying this is a guarantee,
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.280]   but assuming an 8% annual return,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.760]   it would be 1.2 million in about 18 years.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.920]   And at that point you would be FI.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.240]   So you're more or less Coasting into it
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.280]   based on the work that you've done previously
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.240]   by saving in this concerted manner
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.840]   to get your current net worth.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.080]   There really is a great allure to that.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.320]   I know this is something that you're thinking about
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.160]   in your own life, right?
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.400]   Like you clearly have a nice net worth,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.680]   but I think you are not at FI
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   as you would traditionally define it, right?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.680]   - It's funny 'cause 10 years ago,
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.000]   I probably would have said yes.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Then you have children, you move into the Bay Area
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.960]   and you realize how much more money you're spending
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.840]   and you come out of it.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.040]   So it's like you can come into it, you can come out of it.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.520]   For me, I think we've saved enough
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.320]   that it'll cover retirement if it continues to grow
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.120]   and that we can not focus as much on saving
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   in the short term,
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.040]   but we do need to focus on covering our expenses.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.200]   And so that's where it seems like,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.080]   oh, I can do whatever I want.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.480]   Can't do whatever we want.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.960]   We still need a reasonably high pre-tax income
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.600]   to cover where we live and how much we spend each year
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.960]   and probably we'll save more.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.920]   But in a strange way, for me,
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.160]   it's weird to ever withdraw money from your savings.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.600]   So for me, the money we put away in our brokerage account,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.720]   our retirement accounts, that's for retirement.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.680]   Whatever year that starts TBD,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   I feel weird taking money out of it.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.960]   The strange thing in this new Coast Fi world
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.560]   that I'm hours into is this idea that,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.960]   well, maybe it makes sense to withdraw some of it
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.000]   so that we can put other money we make
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.160]   into more tax advantaged accounts.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.600]   So I could actually see a start to draw down
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.840]   on our long-term savings,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.360]   which for us is in our Wealthfront account,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.320]   so that we can increase our solo 401k contributions
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.520]   because there's more tax advantage to doing that.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.480]   That's something that we'll probably still do.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.680]   We're still gonna save,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.360]   but we're gonna also withdraw at the same time,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.080]   which I'm sure will make some financial model confused.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.120]   But for us, it feels like the first time
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.440]   I found a part of the fire movement, if you will,
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.000]   that I'm like, oh, this kind of makes sense now.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.800]   Like, I don't necessarily wanna quit my job.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.000]   And I think a lot of people I talk to
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.200]   don't wanna quit their job,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.520]   or at least don't want to stop working.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.960]   The one nuance to calculating this is thinking,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.480]   when do I wanna stop working?
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.960]   Work backwards from there
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.680]   to figure out how much you need now.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.520]   So like you said, if you wanna stop working in 18 years,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.760]   I'm a bit more conservative.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.040]   I probably use 6%.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.000]   So for me, that takes your 18 to 25.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.200]   If you're cool with a 65-year retirement age
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.880]   and you wanna work backwards by 40,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.600]   you need 1/4 of what you think
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.880]   you need to live on in retirement.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.040]   So if that number is a million dollars, you need 250
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.320]   because you're not gonna touch it.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.360]   It's just gonna grow until that day.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.200]   I don't know.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.480]   We could go down a lot of rabbit holes here.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.680]   I've been really intrigued.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.480]   I will just take a quick tackle on the 4% rule
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.840]   because I went down the Early Retirement Now website,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.560]   which had this great whole thing on safe withdrawal rate,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.760]   sequence of return risk and everything.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.960]   It was like a 60-part blog post series,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.600]   which I will just say is a lot.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.440]   I'll link to the first one in the show notes.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.880]   But I think the 4% rule often gets misinterpreted
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.040]   because it was truly built for a 30-year cycle
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.200]   to end at zero.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.400]   And so if you're using the 4% rule starting at age 30,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.720]   the certainty with which it has worked
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.760]   in the Trinity study that it was based off of
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.480]   would have only gotten you to age 60.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.880]   However, if you look at a lot of the calculations
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.680]   and the Early Retirement Now blog actually has a lot of them,
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.840]   you'll notice that if you just reduce it to 3 1/2
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.600]   or even 3%, it works in perpetuity.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.240]   So if you wanna be really safe,
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.040]   which is what I do in all my projections,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.400]   I use the 3% rule.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.200]   I'm probably underselling things.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.880]   I'm also not factoring in social security or anything else,
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.640]   but that's where I come out with on the 4% rule.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.520]   I think for a handful of reasons,
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.400]   it's probably both too aggressive to be certain
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.600]   and too conservative for what I imagine
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.160]   we will see with returns.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.000]   - Isn't that interesting?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.600]   So listeners of Choose FI will be very familiar
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.520]   with Karsten from Early Retirement Now.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.440]   He is just an amazing, amazing intellect.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.280]   And yeah, like you said,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.480]   if you're looking to dive deep on safe withdrawal rates,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.680]   his 60-part series,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.960]   it's almost laughable to say 60-part series out loud.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.360]   - And by the way, each part is not like three paragraphs.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.280]   Each part is like seven pages of content.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.320]   - Right, thousands of words and graphs and charts and stuff.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.440]   On our show, he basically has said it's almost a guarantee,
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.000]   and he would never use the word guarantee,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.800]   but in every Monte Carlo simulation he's come up with,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.560]   that 3.25% will get you there
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.600]   in virtually every single scenario.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.240]   So like you said, using a 3% safe withdrawal rate
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.800]   is very, very conservative
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.240]   and not including social security.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.600]   Those of us that are inclined to think that way,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.680]   and I am as well, 'cause I mean, I use that 33 times.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.040]   So that's the 3% rule, 33 times your annual expenses.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.360]   We all understand we're being ultra, ultra conservative,
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.840]   but again, a lot of personal finance is psychology.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.320]   It's more than it is numbers.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.560]   And I think if that helps you sleep well at night,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.320]   because again, that word security, right?
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   We'll come back to that.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.720]   That is a really important word.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.120]   It's a really important concept,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.280]   but you have to understand what's the opportunity cost.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.040]   So the opportunity costs potentially
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.800]   are years of your life that you're working.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.840]   Now, if like you, you're doing something that you love,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.080]   and again, I just wrote down as you were talking,
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.120]   who says you have to stop working?
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.000]   As if you need to stop working
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   to be part of the FIRA movement.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.520]   That nonsense is gone.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.640]   It was gone years ago.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.840]   That's not a prerequisite to being a member
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   of the financial independence movement, certainly.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.960]   You can do what you want.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.440]   That's the whole beauty of this, Chris.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.760]   You have the freedom to do what you want in life.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   And if that means you want to work
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.480]   because you love it, then do it.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.200]   That's great, but do it on your own terms.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.560]   Again, we're being a little conservative,
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.440]   but that's okay.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   Understanding what's the opportunity cost.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.040]   And for people who are working in jobs that they don't love,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.560]   it's that one more year syndrome.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.920]   How many people fall prey to that?
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.560]   Like, oh, I don't feel safe enough yet.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.520]   I don't feel safe enough.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.560]   What if I need the 2.5% safe withdrawal rate?
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.080]   What about 2.25?
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.960]   And I don't think social security is going to be here.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.920]   And you can come up with all of this stuff
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   that will keep you working in a job
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.240]   that you potentially hate forever.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   And that's not a good alternative either.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.880]   So clearly I'm kind of setting up
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.640]   a straw man ridiculous argument here,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.440]   but maybe not because I fear there are people
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.840]   that could fall prey to that.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.200]   - The one thing that you got to remember
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.880]   is that it's not binary.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.080]   If you have a job you hate,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.880]   you don't have to just quit that job and never work again
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.720]   and be able to replace your income
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.880]   for the next 30 to 60 years.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.720]   If you build up enough to get you by for a year,
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.880]   then you can go try to find another job
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.920]   that you might like more.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.360]   And it turns out if you love it more,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.880]   you might be able to advance better,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.240]   negotiate a salary better, be more productive.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.320]   You might end up making more money in the long run.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.440]   So I just want to highlight that.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.240]   I know a lot of people that find themselves
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.560]   sometimes in their career, not happy with their job.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.640]   And if I look back,
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.760]   now that I've kind of had the professional experience,
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.440]   most of them found other things
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.760]   pretty quickly that they loved.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.440]   Some took longer than they needed.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.640]   A lot of them worried that they couldn't quit their job
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.160]   because they needed enough money,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.640]   millions of dollars to cover their income forever.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.200]   And I know that because I was one of them,
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.040]   but I quickly found other things that I loved.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.440]   And that's more of an emergency fund issue
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.320]   than a financial independence issue.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.920]   You don't need to have your entire life covered in costs
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.840]   before you can take time to find something you love.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.240]   And I have a good friend who did this.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.200]   He knew he was ready to find something new
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.240]   and knew that it might take a year
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.760]   and had enough savings to do that.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.920]   Didn't think he needed financial independence,
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.200]   retire early money.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.600]   And about six months in,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.560]   he found a thing that he's really excited about.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.040]   And it took time, but he's going to be much happier.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.640]   And I think his career will flourish because of it.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.440]   So that's just one perspective I have.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.280]   - No, that's really cool.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.520]   I mean, that resonates with me in my own life, frankly,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.320]   and you as well, right?
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.480]   We both did this with our own entrepreneurial ventures
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.040]   and it's cool to have options.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.880]   That's what pursuing FI gives you.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.720]   It gives you options.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.840]   For me, I was a CPA and I was on the path to FI.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.240]   I was still a number of years away
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.640]   and I had built businesses on the side.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.840]   They weren't bringing in a ton of money,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.120]   but I had proved the concept to myself.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.000]   And then I said, oh, if I could actually do this full time,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.320]   maybe I could turn this into something.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.520]   In the points and miles world,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.880]   you didn't even realize all this time
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.720]   that we've known each other
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.120]   that that was really my first foray into entrepreneurship
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.320]   was through points and miles.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.560]   I was helping people get to Disney World,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.480]   take Disney World trips,
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.280]   not first class on Singapore Suites or anything like that,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.560]   just literally trips to Disney World.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.040]   Because I figured if I could save $4,000 for my family,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.480]   there are millions of other families
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.640]   who want to go to Disney World.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.280]   And is that super attractive to a 24 year old kid
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.960]   who's looking to fly first class
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.800]   and do all the travel hacking type of stuff?
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.600]   No, but is that appealing to tens of millions of families
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.640]   who want to go to Disney World?
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.480]   Yeah, you bet.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.240]   And then I scaled that with my next business,
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.280]   Travel Miles 101.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   And it was just, I wouldn't have had that opportunity.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.080]   I wouldn't have had the guts, frankly,
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.600]   to leave my nice safe job
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.200]   when I had two daughters and a wife
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.560]   if I wasn't pursuing fine,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.040]   if I wasn't 80% of the way to my fine number.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.400]   It was that security blank.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.800]   It made a massive difference.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.880]   - So you said 80%.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.120]   So I'm curious, how are you tracking this?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.760]   What are the tools that you use?
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.920]   I downloaded Karsten's toolkit,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.400]   which is a spreadsheet that I spent about 20 minutes on it
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.640]   and I made it about 10% or less the way there,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.600]   which is not to say it's not a helpful tool,
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.760]   but I think there's a world
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.440]   where you can go down a lot of rabbit holes.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.640]   So to be clear, his tool is incredible,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   especially when it comes to modeling
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.600]   a lot of the things he talks about.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.520]   And if you want to nerd out,
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.120]   I'll also link to that in the show notes.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.160]   But high level, what are the tools you're using
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.360]   on a daily basis to manage your money
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.640]   and track your financial independence journey?
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.400]   - You, the all the hacks guy
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.040]   are going to be very disappointed in me.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.920]   I am as low key and low tech with this
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.320]   as one could possibly be.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.920]   I still use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.480]   that I've been using for my entire FI journey.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.520]   I have it literally quarter by quarter saved,
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.760]   my net worth saved for the last 10 plus years now.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.800]   And which is actually a really cool exercise.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.240]   And I know our good friend Paula Pant does this as well,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.800]   just loves really getting into the nitty gritty.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.640]   I know it sounds silly,
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.720]   but entering those numbers into the spreadsheet,
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.960]   there's something like really visceral about it
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.360]   that like is better for me personally
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.200]   than using some fancy tool
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.760]   or some fancy projection software.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.320]   And I know you have dove into a whole bunch of these things.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.560]   So I want to get back to you on this
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.480]   'cause you have a better answer.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.320]   But very simply, I have my CPA's brain.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.280]   So I've come up with income statements
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   and net worth statements that I just track in Excel.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.880]   And I maybe spend an hour every month
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.320]   really tying everything out to,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.640]   I run everything through my checking account.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.600]   So I use that as the account that I run everything off of.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.240]   And then any transfers into other accounts,
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.120]   increases or decreases in the account balances
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.840]   at Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.600]   or Wealthfront or wherever it may be.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.880]   And that then ties out to my net worth.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.040]   So I'm doing this about an hour a month, give or take,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   to track my checking account.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.480]   And then at the end of every quarter,
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.720]   I spend probably no more than 30 minutes
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   logging into every account that I own,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.120]   that I have assets at,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.720]   and just jotting down in this Excel spreadsheet,
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.880]   my balance there.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.240]   So it ultimately then ties out to my net worth.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.720]   So I know it sounds like a lot of work.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.560]   It's really not.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.120]   And there is something fun about it.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.320]   So I know that doesn't appeal to you at all,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.920]   but tell us about where the rabbit holes you've dove down.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.160]   - Obviously I took a more tech forward approach
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.000]   than the spreadsheet.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.560]   Although I used the spreadsheet for a long time,
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.280]   but I just found that if I didn't update it for six months,
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.240]   it was just a lot of work.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.160]   So there's two to three tools.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.960]   For a lot of people, it can just be two.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.320]   All of the stuff we've talked about this entire episode
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.280]   really comes down to knowing two things,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.600]   knowing how much you're spending
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.200]   and knowing how much you have.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.400]   And I guess knowing how much you make also,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.840]   but that's usually a lot easier number
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.000]   for a lot of people to peg.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.840]   And so it's how do you track your spending
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.120]   and how do you track your net worth?
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.960]   And how do you project from that
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.560]   would be the third piece of the puzzle.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.760]   I used to try to track spending in Mint many years ago.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.480]   I've done an entire episode
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.200]   where I actually went and used all the tools.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.120]   Mint, YNAB, Monarch Money, Copilot,
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.440]   the one that Quicken launched, Simplify,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.360]   and a couple others.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.280]   And I played with all of them.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.640]   I synced all my 2022 transactions, looked at everything.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.040]   And the end goal was like, I'm gonna pick the best one.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.240]   And I had some ideas of what it would be.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.040]   But at the end of the day, I went with Copilot.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.160]   I think it's for anyone who's on Apple products,
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.000]   it's the best.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.320]   If you're on Android or Windows,
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.640]   it's an iOS, Mac, iPad only adventure.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   But for me, it almost makes it so easy and fun and simple.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.480]   That's just like what I've chosen.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.160]   Then after I reached out to them and I was like,
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.440]   hey guys, I've been pitched by a handful of companies
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.840]   in this space to work with them as sponsors of the podcast.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.000]   But at the end of the day,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.680]   I wanna work with the products I use.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.920]   And that's how I've actually done
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.360]   most of the sponsorships we have.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.560]   So I did end up working with them.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.080]   So full disclosure, they are a partner of the show.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.280]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/copilot,
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.120]   you'll get a discount.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.920]   But I think that is how I manage how much I spend.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.280]   I did a whole episode on all that.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.760]   So I'm not gonna go down that rabbit hole.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.040]   Then for how much money I have generally,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.680]   Wealthfront has a free version of linking your accounts,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.160]   seeing how it's going, doing some light projections.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.840]   I'd put it in the, I don't wanna play around a lot.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.040]   I want you to give me best practices on everything.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.280]   What I think goes a step further than that
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.760]   is a product called Kubera,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.320]   which I first heard about at FinCon
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.360]   when they presented on stage, I later started using.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.400]   And then later, I would say partnered with,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.840]   they're not a sponsor of the show,
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.960]   but we've worked together on the All The Hacks membership.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.240]   So All The Hacks members get
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.720]   their first year of Kubera free.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.520]   Both of these tools are not free.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.560]   So your option of a spreadsheet is free.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.880]   My option of two apps, I paid for both of them.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.320]   They're not huge expenses,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.120]   but Kubera is like, imagine if someone wanted to build
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.360]   the website version of the spreadsheet you have,
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.880]   where you can put it in categories,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.280]   especially on the investment side,
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.480]   you can look at cost bases or IRRs,
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.960]   but they're calculating it all for you.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.200]   They're pulling all the info.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.560]   And then they just launched recently
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.040]   this fast forward feature
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.480]   where you can put in a set of simple rules
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.840]   in multiple scenarios
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   and be able to just see what happens.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.240]   So this isn't the full on financial projection tool
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.520]   that you could go down every rabbit hole
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.200]   of tax assumptions and everything,
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.920]   but you could say, and I'm looking at mine,
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.560]   let's say my assets grow by 3% factoring in inflation.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.520]   Let's say my salary continues for this many years.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.240]   Let's say inflation is this.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.680]   Let's say I have a future expense for college
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.040]   starting in this year, lasting for four years.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.000]   Kind of some simple rules.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   On mine, I have six.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.600]   And it'll project forward and say,
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.960]   here's your net worth in a year,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.640]   five years, 10 years, 20 years,
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.200]   and what that'll generally look like.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.880]   So I've abandoned my spreadsheet for Kubera
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.040]   for tracking net worth and everything.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.720]   The thing that I think has always been the problem
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   is there are a handful of providers of linking services,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.040]   meaning where you'd log into your bank account
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   and they'll pull data on a read-only basis.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.840]   And most apps use one
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.600]   and Kubera works with two or three of the top ones
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.480]   so that they know that if you're trying to sync
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.200]   that obscure Vanguard,
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.320]   a census retirement account that I have,
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.000]   they know to make sure you use Yodlee
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.880]   instead of Plaid because it syncs better.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.840]   So Kubera.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.080]   And then the third one is one
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.560]   that I recently started playing with
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.680]   after a bunch of listeners emailed in and said,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.640]   hey, you haven't included Projection Lab.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.760]   And so I said, oh, you're right.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.280]   I haven't included Projection Lab.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.320]   I'll make sure at some point to go look into it.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.720]   And I had a call actually with Kyle, the CEO
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.000]   or the founder of this company.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.200]   And it's really interesting.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.600]   If you're the kind of person that wants to model out
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.160]   a lot of scenarios, toggle things on and off,
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.080]   look at the tax implications,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.240]   look at the flow of capital on a year-by-year basis,
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.920]   Projection Lab is amazing.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.200]   I will say, I think jumping into it,
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.040]   I wanna set up three simple rules.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   There's an onboarding and you walk through a lot of stuff,
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.160]   but once you're done,
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.400]   the flexibility you have is really cool.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.320]   And you can define steps along the way,
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.080]   like when will I get to financial independence
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.800]   at 33 times income?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   When might I get to fat fire at 50 times income?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.680]   You can set these milestones and see these projections.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.720]   So I would say if someone needs a app
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.200]   to track their spending, I'm a fan of Copilot.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.880]   If someone wants to track their net worth,
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.200]   I'm a big fan of Kubera.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.400]   And if you're an All The Hacks member or want to be,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.200]   it's free for your first year, which is cool.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.640]   And then finally, I would say,
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   if you wanna go really deep in the weeds,
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.840]   you can use Projection Lab.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.000]   And I don't say deep in the weeds,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   like it's not interesting for most people.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.280]   You're gonna spend more time on it.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.800]   I love putting my money on Autopilot,
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.520]   but if I'm trying to figure out big decisions,
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.680]   I like having all the data.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.280]   And so right now we're looking at school.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.000]   If we ended up paying for college or doing private school,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.880]   what are those huge costs?
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.320]   What kind of impact do they have?
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.240]   And I think those are really interesting questions to ask.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.520]   And when you wanna factor in the taxes of it
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.920]   and you wanna factor in required minimum distributions
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   from retirement account, it's pretty interesting.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.480]   - Yeah, you showed it to me right before we jumped on
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.920]   and yeah, it looked fantastic.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.440]   And there is a spectrum.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.800]   Clearly, I think we are the spectrum here,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.960]   aside from people who aren't tracking anything,
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.240]   which please track something at the very least.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.160]   What do you spend?
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.000]   What's your net worth?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.080]   You just, you need to do that.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.040]   Up to you who are trying out all these different tools.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.480]   - I would say by any measure,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.880]   you are being more accurate than I.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.480]   Having these major expenses, like just seeing that.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.800]   In my case, 2026 to 2034,
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.280]   I'm going to have college for each of my daughters.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.440]   It's gonna be eight straight years of college.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.880]   That clearly needs to be factored in somehow, right?
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.360]   And if I was earning zero dollars,
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.480]   then we would potentially have an issue.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.840]   Am I really at five?
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.120]   It's an interesting thought experiment in my case,
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.480]   but for a lot of people,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.600]   hey, if you've quote unquote reach five
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.560]   and maybe you're earning a fraction of what you were
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.440]   and you have these massive expenses coming up
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.640]   that you haven't modeled,
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.880]   there are many of these software options.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.440]   I know there's a new retirement.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.720]   I think there's on trajectory.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.400]   I've just loosely seen those in the past,
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.160]   but yeah, this Projection Lab looks amazing.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.600]   - When I want to do an episode on this,
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.080]   I'll go play with every tool.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.360]   Projection Lab does not get the seal of,
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.480]   I have gone and played with every tool,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.440]   but I just got so many emails from listeners
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.280]   to check it out.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.480]   And many of those people have gone
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.480]   and played with every tool
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.000]   that I thought it was worth looking at.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.800]   But honestly, I say that
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.120]   because I enjoyed spending an afternoon
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.200]   going to enter it in,
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.760]   but I equally enjoyed on Kubera
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.160]   creating four or five,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.560]   or I guess six rules,
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.840]   to college, growth, inflation,
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.160]   when does my income end
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.560]   and how do my expenses change?
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.800]   And just having a very simple form
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.680]   of how do things project out to the future?
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.560]   So I care more about people being aware of the circumstance
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.680]   than I do about them going deep, deep down rabbit holes.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.120]   But those are the three tools that I say
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.200]   all of my financial life lives through.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.680]   It's not related to business, right?
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.600]   There's like quick books for business and all that stuff.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.200]   But for me, those three tools are how I'm doing
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.640]   almost all the tracking.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.000]   We'll see where Projection Lab fits in the long run,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.320]   whether it's a thing I check every month, every year,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.280]   or whether it's a thing I use to make big decisions.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.840]   - No, that makes perfect sense.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.560]   - There is nothing better
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.080]   than finding a brand of clothing
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.720]   that's comfortable, functional, and looks good.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.320]   And that's exactly how I feel
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.440]   about our sponsor today, Viori.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.600]   If you saw me in person, you'd know I believe it
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   because there are very few days that go by
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.000]   where I'm not wearing one, two,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.080]   or even three pieces of Viori.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.440]   They make performance apparel for men and women
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.160]   that's incredibly versatile.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.880]   Everything is designed to work out in
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.120]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.440]   And it is so comfortable,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.240]   you'll wanna wear it all the time.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.440]   I've long said that Sunday performance joggers
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.240]   were my favorites and don't get me wrong,
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.800]   I have at least three pairs
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.000]   and they are the most comfortable pants I've owned,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.360]   but I've been running a lot more
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.080]   and it's still warm in California,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.000]   so I'm wearing my core shorts all the time.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.840]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.880]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.120]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.160]   but they're also great for lounging and running around town.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.920]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.240]   and for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.800]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.000]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.440]   at allthehacks.com/viori.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.840]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.720]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.320]   I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.480]   and even listeners about identity theft and phishing scams
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.720]   causing so much pain and hassle,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.240]   and it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.640]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.080]   and protect our personal data.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.160]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.780]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.760]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.120]   When I first looked up OurFamily,
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.320]   there were hundreds of pieces of our personal info out there
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.520]   but thankfully, I started using Delete.me
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.120]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   removed from the web,
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.060]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.320]   for this episode.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.200]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.780]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.140]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.920]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.760]   and get that removed as well.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.520]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.480]   and on average, they find and remove
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.040]   over 2,000 pieces of personal data for a customer
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.920]   in their first two years.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.000]   When I first signed up, I was actually skeptical
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.120]   about needing a service on an ongoing basis,
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.040]   but these data brokers are relentless,
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.920]   and I've seen my personal data pop up again and again
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.340]   throughout the year, so I love having a service
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.720]   that continuously sends me updated reports
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.520]   on all the removals they're doing in the background.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.720]   So, if you wanna get your personal information
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.800]   removed from the web, go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.240]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.840]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.320]   and supporting the show.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.160]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.860]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.620]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.180]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals,
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.300]   so please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.780]   - And Chris, I actually wanted to double back
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.740]   to something you said before,
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.220]   'cause I think there might be some people
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.860]   who are looking for some additional clarity on this.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.980]   So, we were talking about LeanFi.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.020]   You were saying that you were potentially going to be
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.340]   taking money out of some accounts.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.740]   It sounded like your taxable brokerage account,
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.980]   but you're gonna be putting money in also
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.960]   into, let's say, Solo 401k or some other pre-tax options.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.640]   You mentioned that very much in passing,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.000]   and I always love to close the loop on things.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.440]   Can you give a little more detail on that?
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.920]   Because I think there are gonna be a lot of people
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.320]   who are like, "Chris, I want more info on this,"
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.120]   like the real nuts and bolts of how people are doing this.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.640]   - I did some aggressive saving early on
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.680]   and built up a good taxable brokerage account.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.800]   Now, we could have a whole conversation about
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.200]   was the deprivation of skipping dinners,
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.880]   not ordering appetizers, was all that worth it?
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.820]   The miso soup?
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.220]   - Conversation for another day.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.460]   So now, most of my savings is non-retirement savings,
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.880]   and our expenses have gone up.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.760]   And right now, with Amy leaving her job
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.180]   to work on all the hacks,
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.940]   I would say our income has gone down.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.720]   12 months ago, we had two jobs and a podcast,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.680]   and now we have zero jobs and a podcast.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   And so, we just frankly do not have the income right now
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.520]   to both live and contribute to retirement accounts.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.420]   And that's not to say you should feel bad.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.060]   We're in a fine financial position.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.720]   It's just if you look practically at the dollars coming in,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.940]   all the expenses we have related to the podcast,
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.080]   we have full-time employee, like all this stuff,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.860]   practically, we wanna cover our expenses,
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.020]   and there's just not a big buffer left over
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.580]   to fund retirement accounts.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.760]   However, there are a lot of great options,
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.980]   whether it's Backdoor Roth IRAs or Solo 401ks,
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.380]   or I just got this cool email about this option
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.020]   that I'm not entirely sure how it works,
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.140]   but something that goes one step even further
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.460]   than just Solo 401ks, it was called a Cash Balance Plan.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.660]   I'm just gonna read this description.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.700]   "This is an advanced retirement plan for business owners
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.860]   "that are making mid-hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.060]   "a year in profit and wanna put away more
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.300]   "than the 66,000 a year Solo 401k plan allows.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.280]   "It costs considerably more to set up,
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.640]   "about $2,000 to set up and maintain each year,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.900]   "but it's unparalleled in the size of the benefit,
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.380]   "and it can be combined with the Solo 401k."
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.500]   When I read this, I wasn't thinking, this is for me.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.100]   It made me realize that there are a lot of things
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.060]   as a business owner, or even if you were just an employee,
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.620]   that you could use your money
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.300]   to be more tax-efficient in the future.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.180]   But if you don't have the spare cash, what do you do?
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.980]   It's always been crazy for me to think,
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.320]   let's withdraw from our long-term savings.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.880]   If you look at our wealth front balance
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.520]   for the last five years, it has not been touched.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.860]   We don't withdraw from it ever.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.740]   It's our long-term retirement plan.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.780]   But now I'm like, psychologically,
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.500]   I'm talking about pulling money out of it
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.420]   so that I can take income somewhere else
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.340]   and put it somewhere else,
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.380]   which in turn might mean investing my savings
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.220]   into the business,
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.960]   and then the business contributing to a retirement plan.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.180]   It's a little complicated,
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.780]   and we're working with our accountant
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.260]   to make sure we don't mess it all up,
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.340]   but it's just something that we're considering right now
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.580]   in that interim stage, right?
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.140]   Once you go full quit-your-job financial independence,
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.980]   you tap into your savings all the time.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.500]   But now that I'm living this coast-fi thing,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.460]   which is so funny to say,
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.300]   having misunderstood what it even meant
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.620]   as early as this morning,
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.560]   it's like, well, I don't wanna touch my savings anymore.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.860]   Even though I had that attitude,
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.580]   now I have a name to define
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.220]   why I'm not touching that savings.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.820]   And then almost immediately, I'm like, no, no, no,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.660]   I'm gonna touch it,
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.460]   but I'm gonna replenish it through another door.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.300]   - I love that.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.060]   You are, in essence, you're netting to zero
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.740]   in the sense that you would be pulling money
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.740]   out of your taxable brokerage account
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.140]   to cover your life expenses,
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.060]   but also contributing to retirement accounts,
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.900]   whatever they may be,
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.380]   whether it's this crazy cash balance thingamajig,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.900]   or 401k, et cetera.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.860]   But in essence, what you're doing then
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.100]   is getting the tax benefit from those contributions.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.860]   - I'm basically shifting my after-tax,
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.460]   subject-to-tax-in-the-future investments
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.560]   to tax-advantaged investment accounts,
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.620]   which will reduce my income
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.780]   and give me more growth in the future.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.060]   So it actually is not a zero sum,
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.980]   it's actually a net positive sum,
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.760]   other than the short-term capital gains hits
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.940]   of selling my portfolio,
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.140]   which fortunately,
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.740]   because we've been keeping this money in Wealthfront
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.220]   for a while, we've built up a ton of tax loss harvesting.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.980]   So I think I can actually mitigate most of the capital gains
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.860]   with kind of built-up capital losses.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.860]   So yeah, it'll be a net positive.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.380]   And for anyone listening, I think,
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.720]   look, you might not be a business owner,
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.340]   you might not be in a situation
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.180]   in any way similar to Brad or mine,
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.500]   but if you work at a company
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.660]   and you're not maxing out your 401k
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.860]   because maybe you just had two children
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.980]   and you decided to quit one of your jobs
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.020]   and you're in a situation where cash is tight,
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.060]   but you do have savings in a taxable account,
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.620]   just a standard brokerage account,
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.300]   I'm not gonna talk about what you should do,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.420]   I'm not gonna give personalized financial advice,
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.620]   but definitely worth considering
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.180]   using some of your long-term savings to live on
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.940]   so that you can put some of your income
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.300]   into a more tax-efficient vehicle for long-term savings.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.700]   - And it's important just for people
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.900]   to be cognizant of just this concept.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.820]   It's very cool that you're doing this in real life
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.060]   and welcome to the Coast 5 world, I like it.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.180]   - So one thing we haven't touched on,
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.900]   now that we've evolved our thinking
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.100]   on financial independence over the course of,
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.220]   for you, probably a decade,
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.380]   for me, probably a handful of years,
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.700]   I'm curious to hear some of the changes you've made.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.180]   We both kind of went from more deprivation, less spending,
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.300]   to training ourselves to spend.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.780]   So I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.380]   how did you learn the skill of spending
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.660]   and what have you been using it for?
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.900]   - The skill of spending is such a great way to put it.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.780]   Mr. Money Mustache had come up with this
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.700]   earlier in the year as a phrase
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.340]   that really just appeals to me.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.460]   I think skill of spending on the front side of fi
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.420]   is largely, okay, you do have to be more optimized,
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.260]   especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.100]   or getting into debt every month, you have to cut,
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.780]   you have to be a little more efficient.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.740]   And that doesn't mean deprivation necessarily,
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.340]   but it means being smarter with your money.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.340]   But yeah, Chris, you and I are now at points
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.060]   where we've evolved the other side of the skill of spending
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.420]   is learning how to spend for life benefit,
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.380]   for memory dividends, for enjoyment and connection,
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.180]   for what we talked about last time,
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.380]   something that you're working on
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.060]   is trying to buy back your time in a lot of senses.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.340]   There's lots of ways to spend and to spend well
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.420]   that can really help your life.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.700]   I am really thinking about this in a lot of ways.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.940]   We're certainly spending to get time back
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.020]   just in little ways,
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.420]   even something very obvious to most people,
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.540]   getting a cleaning service at our house,
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.060]   which we never did forever,
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.140]   spending more on food now than we ever have
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.420]   because we just spend a lot of time cooking and cleaning
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.620]   and it doesn't really make that much sense anymore.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.540]   And we're at a point in our lives where the ease,
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.180]   especially with having two daughters
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.700]   now in middle and high school,
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.420]   and we're driving them all over the place
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.460]   and to spend an hour cooking
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.780]   and 20 or 30 minutes cleaning up,
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.180]   it just doesn't make any sense for a couple dollars.
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.020]   So clearly spending more money there.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.140]   The biggest thing is like experiences.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.900]   This is something that I've been honestly
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.300]   really proud of myself this year.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.460]   And this also comes back to the memory dividends
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.340]   and I was zero and Bill Perkins.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.780]   I love music and this is like a part of my life
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.540]   that has really not been an important part of my life
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:26.740]   for the last 10 years
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.700]   because I've let it fall by the wayside in a lot of senses.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.020]   Since my daughters were born,
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.980]   I lost myself.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.180]   That might be hyperbolic,
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.660]   but I lost myself in a lot of the things that I love doing.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.020]   I used to love watching the English Premier League
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.420]   on Saturdays and going to concerts
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.260]   and doing just like a lot of fun stuff
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.380]   that I just had let, like I said, slip away.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.780]   And this year I challenged myself
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.580]   to really make moves on this and see what I can do.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.940]   And I actually planned like an impromptu last minute
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.500]   solo trip to New York City to see Bono from U2.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.740]   So he was doing this like really small concert
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.060]   at the Beacon Theater that was partially a book tour.
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.100]   So it was like half one man show,
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.220]   half book tour/concert.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.180]   It was very interesting.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.220]   But I bought tickets on StubHub,
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.660]   bought flights, got a hotel,
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.140]   and it was like the week before.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.660]   And I'm like, this is the coolest thing ever.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.860]   I'm gonna take a trip to New York.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.700]   I mean, Chris, it was really awesome.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.900]   And that is something I never would have done
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.420]   in my entire life before reorienting the skill of spending.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.980]   - And how did you do that reorientation?
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.100]   I'm not quite there yet.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.820]   What do you think changed that made it possible now
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.380]   when it wouldn't have been possible in the past?
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.620]   - In a weird way, it is understanding that time is finite.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.940]   And maybe that I'm 44 years old, not getting any younger,
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.820]   and my kids are growing up.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.700]   And like I said, I might have lost some part of myself
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.820]   over the last 10 years where I haven't focused
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.500]   on things that bring joy.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.660]   And I just really want to do that.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.740]   There was no moment.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.780]   It was just understanding that you gotta do it.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:57.780]   You gotta live life.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.660]   You can't be worried about saving money all the time.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.620]   And even just little challenges, Chris,
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.940]   like as silly as this sounds,
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.900]   the Richmond Airport is not very expensive,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.180]   long-term parking, or even like the short-term parking.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.660]   But I was like, on this trip to New York City,
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.540]   what would doing this trip like a rich person look like?
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.180]   And it was almost like a Ramit Sethi kind of thing.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.660]   And it was not parking in economy parking.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.420]   It was parking in the daily lot that was right there.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.260]   And I could just walk over to the airport.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.500]   And Chris, this cost me like nine extra dollars
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.780]   'cause it was a 24-hour trip.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.340]   So this is not that big of a deal.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:28.980]   And it might've even been less than that, frankly.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.020]   But it just felt great.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.420]   It was really cool.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:34.100]   And it was like, okay, how can you find these little things
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.260]   that actually make a difference?
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.340]   And going back to the food,
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.580]   like we're now getting these amazing meals
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.100]   brought into the house, and it's just a couple dollars more,
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.060]   but it's just reorienting to what's the value here?
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.620]   So it's this valuist play, is like this term valuist.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.660]   I've talked about this on the podcast for so many years,
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.300]   but I never really embodied it in actuality.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.860]   I think I did to some degree, but I didn't get there.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.260]   And I know it sounds a little morbid,
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.780]   but I think it's important,
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.340]   is understanding the finite nature of your life,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.660]   the finite nature of seasons of your life.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.600]   I took a trip to see Taylor Swift in Pittsburgh
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.860]   with my older daughter,
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.860]   and we bought very expensive tickets on secondary.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.140]   And man, Chris, we had the time of our lives.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.140]   We'll be talking about that 30 years from now.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.140]   It was amazing.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.660]   And I don't regret any single one of those dollars
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.580]   I spent on that trip.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.540]   It was astonishing.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.060]   And I'm really fortunate to be in this position,
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.300]   but I'm really proud of myself that made these changes
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.380]   in that shorter period of time.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.820]   - A lot of the language you're using,
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.300]   memory dividends, seasons of life,
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.900]   were languages from Bill Perkins' book, "Die With Zero."
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.340]   I had him on episode 91, but I can't quite remember.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.940]   Did that have a big impact on you?
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.660]   - That book had a massive impact on me.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.500]   It really did.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.300]   And it was just the conceptual framework.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.460]   Chris, I knew all this stuff.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.060]   Sometimes it just crystallizes and hits
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.580]   in a moment when it matters.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.740]   And I think that's what's also interesting
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.700]   about taking in a lot of different content.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.020]   I probably listen to way more podcasts and read more books
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.340]   than I probably should, frankly,
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.340]   but sometimes you hit on something like this
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.980]   where it is just a life-changing thing,
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.780]   and I don't know what it was.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.140]   But again, I'm even doing little things now.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:09.540]   I went to a yoga and meditation retreat last month.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.780]   That's something I never would have done.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.940]   I never would have had the guts
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:16.020]   to just go off for two days by myself and just be.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:16.980]   And it was awesome.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.460]   It was just really fantastic.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.020]   Again, just trying to build these things into life.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.460]   I'm part of a mastermind group
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:26.180]   where it's about 24, 25 of us guys,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.740]   and now we're trying to do more in-person events.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.380]   And Chris, I always had an excuse.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.180]   It was always like, oh, it's too far.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.940]   Oh, I need to be home for the weekend
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.500]   with my wife and my daughters.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.100]   It's selfish to leave.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.100]   That's a script that I always had running in my head.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.260]   It's selfish to leave.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.580]   But you know, it's really important
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.020]   to take care of yourself too,
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.820]   and to find joy in little ways.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.260]   We had this day of fun at one of my buddy's house.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.020]   12 of us kind of converged on his house in New Jersey,
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:54.100]   and we had eight hours of playing this Olympics of games
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.180]   'cause it was the most fun I've had in years.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.100]   One of the guys cooked
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.180]   this amazing Michelin star-esque dinner.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.020]   One of those days I'll remember forever.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.460]   I know, I could tell you for certain.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.500]   A year ago, I would have said no to that weekend.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.340]   I would have just said out of hand, no.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.060]   So again, this reorientation.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.100]   So a lot of things have changed in my life,
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.340]   and I think they've changed for the better.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.180]   - I don't think it's selfish to take care of yourself.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.300]   I think it's selfish if you don't encourage your partner
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.340]   to also do the same.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.700]   So I'm sure you found that balance as well,
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.420]   and I think that's the important thing.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.980]   I had a similar moment, which was more serendipitous
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.380]   in that it wasn't something I would have said no to,
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.820]   but we had this moment where we invited some friends up
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.380]   to a house we were staying at in Napa, not ours,
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.740]   and there was a volleyball court.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.860]   And for like two hours,
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.820]   we were all just playing outdoor volleyball,
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.140]   probably getting sunburned,
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.900]   but we're blasting some good '80s rock.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.100]   And I just had this moment where I was like,
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.980]   wow, I want more moments like this.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.740]   And the downside is that with kids and stuff,
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.980]   you have to really plan them.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.500]   You can't just expect to text five friends and be like,
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.620]   hey, do you all want to go do this thing
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:52.780]   an hour away right now?
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.180]   No, it's not practical anymore.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.980]   Maybe when I get a little older and my peers and friends
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.420]   or kids are a little older and easier to travel with,
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.620]   maybe it'll get a little better,
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.140]   but you have to plan ahead and you have to commit earlier.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.820]   And I think I'm still learning,
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.380]   but you've got a couple of years on me
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.420]   and your kids do as well.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.780]   So I hope I get to that place where you are.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.900]   But I had the same impact when I talked to Bill Perkins
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.060]   and I made that episode.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:17.020]   And we actually planned a trip to London and Paris.
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.420]   I talked about it in the episode
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.260]   and then we just booked it.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.740]   And we were like, we just have to do it.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.740]   And in a weird way,
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.180]   we stopped tracking our net worth after that episode.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.980]   We stopped caring about whether it went up
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:29.220]   and we started focusing on, do we just have enough now?
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.620]   And when do we want to spend our money?
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.700]   Do we want to spend it later?
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.900]   Do we want to stop working?
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:35.900]   And for us, now we've both found something we like doing.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.260]   So I don't know, it changed a lot for me.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.180]   I'd encourage anyone to go pick it up and read it.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.140]   Or if you want to preview the hour version,
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.980]   I interviewed him in episode 91,
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.300]   which I can link to in the show notes.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.740]   But yeah, that changed a lot for me.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.060]   And we started spending a little bit more on things
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.780]   that some have an ROI, some don't.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.540]   But I actually am surprised at how much
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.100]   we've been able to accomplish with the podcast
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.780]   now that we have a little more free time
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:04.220]   because we've spent a little bit of money on other things.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.380]   Whether that's someone to clean or someone to help with food,
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.500]   or that's hiring an assistant or an employee for your company,
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.460]   these things that felt like they were big expenses
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.220]   we were nervous about, but now that we have them,
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.140]   they've unlocked a little bit more creativity,
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.380]   a little bit more time.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.180]   And we've been good in our career
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.100]   at turning that into opportunity.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.220]   And so you'll never know unless you try.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.460]   That's some expenses, right?
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.220]   The Taylor Swift concert is probably not one
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.300]   that's going to make you more money in the long run,
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.220]   but it's certainly one that's going to give you
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.140]   memories that far exceed that.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.740]   Whatever version of that exists
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.380]   when our daughters are a little older,
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.580]   I'm very excited to do the same thing.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.460]   - Yeah, and it's important to prioritize it,
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.740]   just it being in your mind.
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.220]   And like you said, going back and listening
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.140]   to that episode 91 of "All the Hacks,"
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.900]   that episode was more impactful to me than the book was.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.700]   Honestly, hearing him talk it through,
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.820]   that's a perfect starting point for people.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.860]   - To go back to the "Early Retirement Now" blog,
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.740]   he gave a review of that book.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.900]   - Yeah, that was part 60, right?
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.020]   - Yeah, and what was interesting was he justifiably said,
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.220]   "A lot of these things aren't new."
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.340]   And I think the thing that Bill Perkins did
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.980]   was he took a bunch of concepts
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.700]   that we've all known, right?
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.260]   We've all known that experiences are valuable.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:15.100]   We all know that money diminishes, our health diminishes,
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.940]   but if you could package it in a good way,
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.060]   ultimately a lot of things are just storytelling.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.260]   And I will say that when it comes to telling a story
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.460]   about money, most people aren't that great at it.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.300]   Like it's something that a lot of people get bored with,
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.140]   aren't interested in,
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.260]   and Bill Perkins weaves a story around it
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.500]   that I think just comes alive when you hear him talk
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.460]   more than when you read the book.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.540]   You'll hear a reminder if you go listen to it,
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.780]   and I'll give it to you here.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.700]   It is not an episode to listen to
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.340]   with young children in the room.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:43.860]   He has a very colorful vocabulary.
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:44.900]   - He does indeed.
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.820]   And yeah, I mean, even like you said,
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.980]   talking about health, right?
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.180]   And health and longevity and vitality,
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.820]   spending money on that is important.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.740]   I think we both have become a little more cognizant of that.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.420]   I know this year I hired a personal trainer
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.660]   who I met through Twitter, which was kind of wild,
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.580]   but that again is something I can guarantee you.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.300]   Two years ago, there was no chance
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.140]   that I would have done that, 0% chance.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.460]   And it has been the best money I've ever spent
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.700]   on my health in my entire life.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.780]   - I got a question about this.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.620]   - Yeah, shoot.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.900]   - So I was watching this video that a past guest of mine,
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.380]   Nisair Yasin, Nas Daily made,
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.220]   and he hired a personal trainer in India
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.540]   from this company called Fitter.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.020]   And I haven't done it yet.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.940]   I haven't pulled the trigger on this service yet,
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.820]   but I was thinking about it and I want your perspective.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.980]   So your personal trainer's remote, right?
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.100]   They're not located where you are.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.060]   You don't see them in person.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:32.900]   They don't come to the gym with you, right?
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.460]   Is there a reason that they need to be in the US?
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.740]   Because if you look at the cost of living around the world,
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.420]   if someone could motivate you just as well,
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.500]   but in India, they can certainly live on less.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.660]   And I was blown away.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.940]   And by the way, I have no connection to this company,
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.380]   so I don't want to endorse it at all.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.500]   But I was looking at it and the personal training sessions
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.380]   were like $5 a session.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.460]   And you could do it five days a week,
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:59.100]   monthly for $100 a month or something in that ballpark.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.300]   I don't want to quote the prices
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.540]   'cause I'm not an expert here,
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.820]   but I was just surprised.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.580]   And then it just got me thinking
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.820]   there are some services and practices
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.020]   that are really tied into our system, right?
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.220]   Hiring a tax accountant,
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.100]   you want someone who's really familiar with the rules
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.100]   and the regulations here.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.420]   But I was like, ah, personal trainer,
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.260]   someone to just throw on a tripod
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.180]   and motivate me to work out and whatnot.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.180]   Live video sessions every time.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.740]   Why couldn't that person be overseas?
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.220]   So I want to hear your perspective
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.940]   on whether you think that you could get
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.860]   a similar output from that.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.100]   And if so, how does that change your thinking?
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.540]   - Yeah, that is really interesting.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.780]   I definitely think that you could hire someone
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:36.940]   from anywhere in the world.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.780]   So it depends what you're looking for, right?
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.220]   So how you described it,
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.660]   if you're looking for somebody to be there with you
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.500]   or just create a video or whatever,
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.020]   five days a week, motivation, a little accountability,
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.860]   absolutely, it makes no difference where they are.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.900]   Dean Turner is my personal trainer and he's fantastic.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.620]   DeanTurnerTraining.com is where he's located in.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.100]   But he's in Philadelphia, which is not that far from me,
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:00.340]   but I'm never going to meet him in person in all likelihood.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.460]   So yeah, he could be in India, he could be in Australia,
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.740]   it would make no difference whatsoever.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.340]   I am paying for his expertise though,
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.260]   not for the motivation.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.140]   Clearly, if I was paying for motivation,
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.940]   I would move to that service you just mentioned.
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:14.980]   That sounds like a slam dunk.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.940]   That actually sounds amazing.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.020]   I suspect a lot of people would benefit from them.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.300]   - You could even pair the two, right?
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.740]   You could probably find Dean and be like,
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   help me come up with the curriculum.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.180]   And then say, great, now someone else that like,
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.420]   this is my big challenge with a lot of services
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.940]   is that you wanna pay for experience and execution.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.060]   And you can't get good experience without paying for it.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.580]   People charge a lot more for their time
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.420]   when they have experience.
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:40.140]   It doesn't make sense to pay for the execution also.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.780]   And I think about this with financial planning.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.260]   A human financial planner will give you
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.340]   a better financial plan that kind of connects
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:46.180]   to your emotions and stuff.
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.300]   And I'm not against people paying a fixed price for that.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.500]   I think that's really valuable.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.300]   It's just, if you then on top of that,
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.620]   tack on a ongoing 1% of your assets forever fee
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.180]   to manage the investments.
[00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.700]   That's where I'm like, I don't know.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.740]   So I wonder if there's a hybrid approach here
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.820]   where I think it's totally fine to pay financial planning,
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.980]   fixed fee annually, and then a much smaller fee
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.820]   for investments.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.740]   Is there a Dean Turner plus fitter like super combo
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.900]   where you get daily motivation and workout regimens
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.100]   following the curriculum of someone
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.420]   who has a lot more experience and personalization?
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.260]   - That's fascinating.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.700]   So this now is turning into a business lesson for Dean.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.940]   I wonder if he could scale his business more that way,
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.860]   if he used his expertise to create the programming,
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.660]   but then he found these people wherever they may be
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.020]   and it's certainly a lower cost area.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.540]   And he could then potentially outsource
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.180]   part of the day-to-day with knowledgeable people
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.900]   who are well-versed in his methodology.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.540]   That would actually be really interesting.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.020]   - Dean, if you're listening at a minimum,
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.580]   if you go down this path, I'd love to give it a try.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.980]   - That would be really cool.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.660]   I bet he'd be super interested in that,
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   to be continuing on that.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.340]   But I think accountability is important.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.660]   I think that's why people like group exercise classes also.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.140]   Somebody else is waiting for them,
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.700]   whether it's CrossFit or yoga or whatever it may be.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.140]   When you have people waiting for you,
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.700]   it's so easy to fall out of an exercise routine.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.420]   To me, accountability and motivation
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.220]   are really, really important.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.540]   - That's why I thought this was so interesting
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.500]   'cause I was like, you know what?
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.340]   I would work out to avoid losing $5.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.140]   I might've gotten comfortable in my life spending money,
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.260]   but I have not gotten comfortable losing money.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.580]   It seems so much harder to be comfortable
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.820]   just giving up money,
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.860]   even though you probably, in some cases, should.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.700]   So in this particular case, I'm like,
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.540]   it would almost be worth it just to say,
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.980]   I'm gonna work out three days a week from eight to 8.30,
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.620]   and I'm gonna book it with a person, just any person.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.060]   It could even be non-existent.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.380]   I'm gonna pay this money,
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:43.620]   and my wife gets to light it on fire if I don't work out.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.780]   But even better if you have someone that can sit there
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.540]   and kind of motivate you along the way.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.900]   Anything else you've been doing in health
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.740]   that's worth covering?
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.260]   I know the last time you were on,
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.180]   you said 2023 is gonna be your year to get healthy.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.620]   - My bold move was healthiest year ever.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.940]   I talked last episode about DNS that I have been doing
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:04.420]   to deal with some nagging shoulder and hip issues
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.660]   that I had, and that's helped dramatically.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.540]   I think I've just been much more open, again,
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.860]   to spending money on massage.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.980]   I get a massage in that cupping thing.
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.100]   I don't know if you've ever seen that,
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.540]   on swimmers at the Olympics.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.700]   So I do that once a month.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.140]   I found something in a Tony Robbins book
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.060]   that he was talking about,
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.820]   this thing called fascial counter strain,
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.700]   and it's like a massage/fascial release,
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.220]   which I really, really enjoy.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.860]   What's so funny is the guy who owns the business
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.740]   here in Richmond is in the financial independence world.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.780]   He's like, "Are you by any chance Brad from Choose a--?"
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.620]   It was hilarious.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.380]   So yeah, I mean, I've been doing that.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.860]   I bought an Oura ring to track my sleep.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.740]   So I've been really focusing
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.140]   and trying to dial in my sleep a lot.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.660]   I think I mentioned to you that I bought a hot tub,
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.820]   and I just bought a cold plunge,
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.060]   but it was actually not one of those
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.580]   super-duper expensive ones.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.420]   One of our listeners, a guy named Mitch,
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.340]   reached out to me and told me about this thing
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.020]   called IcePod, so it's by the--
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.500]   - Oh, I thought you were gonna go down the path
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.460]   of the ice barrel, but the IcePod.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.500]   - It is something you can buy.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.060]   So it's by The Pod Company.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.540]   It looks like podcompany.com.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.100]   This thing's 150 bucks.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.580]   Honestly, Chris, it's nothing special.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.260]   It's an insulated little,
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.900]   if you've ever seen one of those blow-up hot tubs
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.260]   that cost like 500 bucks,
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.100]   this is something similar for cold plunge,
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.020]   but the last handful of nights,
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.300]   we just got it up and running.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.740]   My two daughters and I have gone out after dinner.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.900]   It's getting dark now, getting later in the year.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.300]   We go out, go in the hot tub, go in the cold plunge,
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.580]   back in the hot tub, and it's just like
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.740]   this cool little experience together.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.220]   I mean, this cold plunge thing, like I said,
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.340]   it was like 150 bucks.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.220]   It was fantastic.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.460]   So even if we don't use it much beyond
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.420]   the next month or two, it would be well worth it.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.660]   Just all these little things
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.220]   that I'm just trying to add to my life.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.380]   Some of the stuff is really cool,
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.060]   like these experiences that I'm having now with my family.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.940]   - One of ours will be a sauna.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.180]   Days from now, we're getting added on,
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.340]   which will finally, I think,
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.820]   get our cold plunge more usage.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.180]   For as much as I enjoy hot tubs,
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.820]   I enjoy saunas a lot more.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.260]   - Is it an infrared sauna or a barrel sauna?
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.100]   - It is neither.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.100]   It is a full kind of finish.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.100]   I've been working with this company
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.460]   that I'm not ready to share,
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.580]   but when I am, they might be like
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.260]   the best sauna makers in the US,
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.780]   at least making it accessible.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.140]   A much more finished sauna experience.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:18.220]   I went really deep down the rabbit hole of saunas,
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.220]   and there's this Trumpkin guide to saunas,
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.100]   which is this crazy guide,
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.700]   and barrel saunas have plenty of critique.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.340]   So I was on the fence about it,
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.660]   and I actually met someone who was like,
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:29.820]   "I'm building this company,
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.460]   "and we're gonna make the best saunas,
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.820]   "and we're gonna do it in a way that is modular
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.100]   "and easy for people to order and set up at their home
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.420]   "and build something really nice."
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.700]   And I'm very excited,
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.380]   but this is like a proper finish sauna style experience.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.900]   Amy and I are very excited to add this to our routine,
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.460]   and ideally it'll be like a put the girls to bed
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.260]   and have a little time together in the sauna,
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.780]   dip out to the cold plunge,
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.140]   finish off in the sauna, and sleep better.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:56.100]   - Heck yeah, I love it.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.100]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.180]   All right, so to be continued on that one, for sure.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.100]   - Maybe the fourth edition of Brad and Chris
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.500]   record a podcast together.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.940]   If you make it out to the West Coast,
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.420]   we can see if the audio equipment handles the heat.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.740]   Might not be a video version, but you know.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.020]   (laughing)
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.540]   - 2024 goals, I like it.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.780]   - Awesome, this has been great.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.820]   The emails I got after the last time we did it,
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.580]   I think I got 20 emails that were just like,
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.100]   "Subject, more Brad."
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.020]   So for the 20 people who wrote in asking for more Brad,
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.860]   here you are.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.500]   Hopefully there was at least a more Chris email
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.700]   in your inbox too, I'll just pretend there was.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.180]   - Yeah, no, you know we got flooded with them.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.100]   I copied you on all the responses,
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.380]   so you know they came in.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.980]   - Awesome, well, this has been great.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.860]   I'm excited for your healthiest year ever.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.220]   I hope you finish it out strong,
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.500]   and we'll chat soon.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.340]   - Thank you, my friend.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.620]   As always, it's good to chat with you.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.460]   Until next time.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.180]   - I always enjoy having Brad on the show,
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.300]   and I know you do too,
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.220]   because the last time I did an episode like this with Brad,
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.580]   I asked if you wanted more,
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.780]   and a bunch of you sent in an email saying,
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.220]   "Do more episodes with Brad."
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.780]   So I really hope you enjoyed it.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:57.860]   I know I did.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.700]   If you have any topics or questions
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.220]   for the next time we do this,
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.540]   or really anything at all,
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.580]   you can send it to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.580]   I read every email that comes my way,
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.020]   even if I don't get a chance to reply.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.140]   Thank you so much for joining this week.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.460]   I will see you next week.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:26.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:36.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
