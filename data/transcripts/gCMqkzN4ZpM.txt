[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   The closer you get to the goal, generally the harder people and animals work to finish that goal.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.680]   That's what led us then to think, okay, you know, those rats, those mice, those people are seeing a finish line, right?
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.940]   And it's when they're maybe seeing that finish line, seeing that reward, seeing the goal they're hoping to accomplish,
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.280]   that is what's leading them to, you know, try harder to invest more so that they can finish it off.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.660]   What if we induce that illusion of proximity?
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:38.160]   What if we can induce a visual illusion, a visual experience that approximates what the real rats and mice were actually experiencing as they got closer?
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.340]   That is what is happening.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.840]   That's what's happening visually when we create that narrowed focus of attention.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.920]   When we tell people, imagine there's a spotlight on the shorts of the person up ahead or the stop sign that you're seeing.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.760]   It induces an illusion of proximity that then is responsible for people trying harder, walking faster,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.600]   feeling that it defied their expectations and that it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be.
