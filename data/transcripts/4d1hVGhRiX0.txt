[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Most of you will remember that we are, this evening, beginning our study of the seventh
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.920]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, starting with this first verse, "Know ye
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.440]   not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law, how that the law hath dominion over
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.400]   a man as long as he liveth?" Now, this is, of course, one of the famous chapters in the
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.600]   epistle to the Romans. Anybody who knows anything at all about Christian doctrine and theology
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.240]   has often, I am sure, talked about and argued about the seventh chapter of the epistle to
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.680]   the Romans. No chapter, perhaps, has been more frequently the cause of discussion and
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.840]   disputation and argument than this particular chapter. That is why most people are more
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.440]   familiar with it than they are with chapter six, which, if I were compelled to compare
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.660]   these chapters one with another, I would say is an altogether greater chapter than this
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.520]   seventh chapter. However, that does not matter. My point is that most people are familiar
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.080]   with this because of the argument that generally takes place with regard to the final section,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.060]   which runs from verse 13 to the end of the chapter. And then, of course, the great discussion
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.640]   is what is Paul exactly saying there? Is he describing himself as he then was or as he
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.120]   once was? Is it the description of a man before his conversion or a man after his conversion?
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.980]   And you are familiar with the great argument. Well, I would indicate even now at the very
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.860]   introduction that I shall have very little indeed to say about that, because that is
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.920]   not by any means the most important thing in this chapter. It is a very great chapter,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.280]   as we shall see, if we only approach it in the right way. And the wrong way is the one
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.320]   I have just been indicating, that you rush through the first verses in order that you
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.360]   can get to this final section. And most people who fail to understand the final section do
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.980]   so simply because they have never understood the first section. This meant the Apostle
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.040]   Paul had a very logical mind, and he always goes on from step to step. There is no writer
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.460]   in the Bible in whose case it is more dangerous to just pounce suddenly on a verse or a paragraph
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.240]   than this great Apostle. And therefore, it is very important as we come to consider the
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.160]   teaching of this chapter that we should remind ourselves of its setting, how it was that
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.200]   he ever came to write it at all, and what he is attempting to do as he writes it. Therefore,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.080]   I would start by reminding you again of the connection.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.220]   Chapters 6 and 7 of this epistle to the Romans, it seems to me, and I have been saying this
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.180]   before in connection with chapter 6, they must be regarded as a parenthesis. In other
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260]   words, there is a sense in which it is right, if you were reading to get the main drift
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.660]   of his argument, you should go straight on from chapter 5 verse 21 to chapter 8 verse
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.220]   1, or if you like, chapter 8 verse 5. It does not matter very much which; we will discuss
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.680]   that later. But the point is that chapters 6 and 7 are a parenthesis. The Apostle turns
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.060]   aside in order to clear up certain difficulties which he knew perfectly well would arise in
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.260]   the minds of the readers of this letter in Rome, and which had already arisen in the
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.660]   minds of many Christian people in many other churches also. Now, what is that? Well, you
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.900]   remember, it is this. Paul makes a tremendous statement at the end of chapter 5 in verses
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.700]   20 and 21. "Moreover," he says, "the law entered that the offence might abound; but where sin
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.140]   abounded, grace did much more abound; that, as sin had reigned unto death, even so might
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.900]   grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Now, that
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.220]   is the fundamental statement. You see, it winds up the argument of chapter 5, and especially
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.820]   verses 12 to 19, this tremendous statement about our incorporation into Christ, that
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.060]   we now are to Christ as we once were to Adam, and that because of that, of course, our whole
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.500]   future is certain and guaranteed. "Because where sin abounded, grace did much more abound;
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.780]   and as sin hath reigned unto death, so will shall grace reign through righteousness unto
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.460]   eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Now, the apostle immediately is aware of the
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.580]   fact that a statement like that is liable to serious misunderstanding. And it was being
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.540]   misunderstood. He has already said in chapter 3 that he is being slanderously reported as
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.340]   saying certain things, and he was very frequently judged in the wrong way like that. People
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.980]   did say more slanderous things against the apostle. And as we indicated there, if our
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.380]   preaching does not expose us to these slanderous statements, the probability is that we are
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.180]   not really preaching the gospel. No man was so slandered as was Martin Luther, who rediscovered
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.580]   this great truth, you remember, and that led to the Protestant Reformation. He was exposed
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.220]   to all sorts of slanderous statements. It was reported slanderously that he had been
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.300]   saying this and that. That was the fate of the apostle Paul. And if you preach the doctrine
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.980]   of justification by faith truly, well, you will be misunderstood, probably, because of
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.380]   the very staggering character of the great doctrine.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.180]   Well, now, then, the apostle, you remember, at once sees that at any rate two main charges
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.140]   are going to be brought against him. The first is the charge of antinomianism, the charge
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.580]   that he is more or less teaching, "Live as you like, sin as much as you like. It's
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.300]   all right. Grace is going to look after you, and everything will be well." So he takes
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.260]   that up in chapter 6. What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.820]   And you remember, we have considered how he refutes that argument completely. He does
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:50.420]   so in verses 1 to 13 of chapter 6, in terms of showing that the abounding of grace has
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.500]   the exact opposite effect of that. But then he had said in verse 14 that, "Sin shall
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.540]   not have dominion over you, for you are not under law, but under grace." And that again
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.300]   he knows will be misunderstood, and people will say, "Very well, then, if we are not
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.420]   under law, shall we sin? What, then, shall we sin, because we are not under the law but
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:18.780]   under grace?" And again he refutes that in a final and in a complete manner. He demolishes
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:26.100]   these false suggestions. He proves that the effect of the abounding of grace, far from
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:33.540]   encouraging sin, is going to mean the death of sin, and great holiness and righteousness
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.780]   and glory in the presence of God. Indeed, he has proved that the whole design of grace
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:47.660]   is to promote holiness, because the purpose of grace is to make us holy, unblameable,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.020]   and perfect in the presence of God. Very well, there was the first charge. "It's no use
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.100]   saying," said these people, "where sin abounds, grace does much more abound, because people
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.140]   will at once say, 'Well, very well, then, do as you like, doesn't matter. Grace will
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.100]   always superabound, and all will be well.' It encourages antinomianism." He has refuted
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:14.460]   that finally and completely. But now he still has another problem to deal with, because
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.480]   at the end there of chapter 5, in those two verses, he has not only been saying things
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:26.340]   about grace, he has also been saying things about law. And he still has to deal with that.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:33.100]   And that is, of course, exactly what he does in this seventh chapter. The second charge,
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.580]   in other words, brought against the apostle was that this preaching of his of justification
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:44.580]   by faith only, and of being united to the Lord Jesus Christ, seemed to be doing away
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:52.980]   altogether with the law, and the whole notion of law in God's treatment of the human race.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.700]   Now, it is not surprising that people should say that, because the apostle has used a rather
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.100]   daring phrase about it in the twentieth verse of the fifth chapter. Do you remember it?
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:10.540]   "Forever," he said, "the law entered," which we translated like this, "the law
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.620]   came in by the side," as it were. It wasn't on the main line; it came in sideways. "The
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:22.780]   law entered." "Ah," said people with a legalistic mind and with a Judaistic background,
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.140]   "you shouldn't speak of the law like that. You mustn't speak of the law as something
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.660]   that comes in by the side, as a sort of a side. Isn't that to derogate from the greatness
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.100]   and the glory of the law? Isn't that virtually to suggest that law is something which is
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:44.480]   more or less indifferent?" Well, there it was. The apostle had said, "The law entered."
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.380]   And he knows that this is liable to misunderstanding, so he devotes this seventh chapter to an explication
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.900]   of what he meant by putting it like that. But then, of course, he repeated that and
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.820]   put it perhaps even still more strongly in the fourteenth verse of chapter six. In winding
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:08.220]   up his first argument in chapter six, he had said, "For sin shall not have dominion over
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:16.740]   you." And his reason for saying that is this, "For," because, "you are not under the law,
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.900]   but under grace." And he seems to be very proud of that. He seems to glory in the fact.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.900]   He says, "It's all right. Sin shall not have dominion over you, for, thank God, you are
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.900]   not under the law, but you're under grace." Well, he seems to be giving another blow to
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:38.060]   the law. He's already knocked it down, as it were, in 520. He's now stamping upon it
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.140]   and glorying in the fact that they're not under the law, but under grace. And therefore,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:50.620]   these opponents take up the cudgels, you see, at this point, and they say, "Surely, these
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:56.100]   are very wrong and very dangerous statements to make. Surely," they say, "if you are going
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.700]   to abrogate the law, do away with the law altogether, you are doing away with every
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.100]   guarantee you've ever had of righteous and holy conduct and behavior. You'll never get
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.060]   sanctification without the law. If you treat the law like that and dismiss it and seem
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:20.020]   to rejoice in it, well, are you not again encouraging lawlessness? And are you not almost
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:28.420]   inciting people to live a sinful life? Law, they believed, was the great guarantee of
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:35.100]   holy living." Very well, then, the apostle clearly has to safeguard himself and the truth
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:42.260]   against that particular misunderstanding and that particular charge. Now, that is exactly
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:48.660]   the purpose of this seventh chapter. It is to explain what he means when he says that
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.900]   the law came in by the side, and what he means when he says that we should rejoice in the
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:02.860]   fact that we are not under the law, but under grace. This seventh chapter is a kind of expanded
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:10.620]   exposition or explication of both those statements. Or, to put it positively, its purpose is to
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:19.580]   show us the function and the purpose of the law. But, of course, the apostle always has
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:29.500]   a particular object in view, and it is this. He is out to show that sanctification by the
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:38.020]   law is as impossible as was justification by the law. Now, that was the theme, you see,
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.540]   of the first four chapters, that you can never be justified by the law. He had already put
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.140]   it in a great statement in chapter 3, verse 20, "Therefore, by the deeds of the law shall
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:54.340]   no man be justified in his sight." That's it, categorical. He is saying here in chapter
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.980]   7, "Therefore, by the deeds of the law shall no man be sanctified in his sight." As it
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:07.940]   is impossible to be justified by the law, it is equally impossible to be sanctified
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:15.300]   by the law. And he puts it as strongly as this, as we shall see, that not only can you
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:21.980]   not be sanctified or sanctify yourself by the law, but that indeed it is true to say
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:30.580]   that the law is an actual hindrance to sanctification. It hinders it. It indeed, in a sense, renders
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:37.700]   it quite impossible. That is the thesis of this seventh chapter. Not only can you not
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:47.380]   sanctify yourself by an observance of the law, the law is even a hindrance and an obstacle
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:54.740]   to sanctification. Very well, then, there is his general thesis. That's the fundamental
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:00.540]   thing that he is setting out to prove, and we must keep it very firmly in our minds.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:08.160]   Now then, how does he do it? Well, you can subdivide this chapter into three sections.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.500]   Never is it more important that we should have a bird's eye view, as it were, of a
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:17.620]   chapter before we come to the details. You can easily get muddled and lost in some of
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.780]   these statements if you don't bear in mind what he is really saying fundamentally. So
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:28.260]   it is very essential that we should have a broad division in our minds with respect to
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:39.900]   his argument. First division, chapters 1 to 6, verses 1 to 6. Here we have a general statement
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:51.060]   in which he defines our relationship as believers to the law. At the same time, he shows why
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:15:01.840]   a change in our relationship to the law is absolutely essential for our sanctification
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:10.900]   as it was for our justification. Now, the key verse of this first section, verses 1
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:18.500]   to 6, is verse 4. First verse 4 is the crucial verse. Listen to it. "Wherefore, my brethren,
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.700]   you also are become dead to the Lord by the body of Christ." Why? Well, in order that
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.540]   you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead. But why should
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.580]   you be married to him? Why should you be married to anybody? But especially, why should you
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:42.020]   be married to him? Here is the answer. "That in order that we should bring forth fruit
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:47.020]   unto God." That is the matter. That is the question. What he is concerned about is this
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.860]   is the bringing forth of this fruit unto God. And his case in the whole chapter is that
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.140]   you can never bring forth fruit unto God as long as you are married to the law. There
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.620]   is only one way to bring forth fruit to God, and that is to be married to the Lord Jesus
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:07.140]   Christ. That is his case. Now then, in the first section, verses 1 to 6, he puts it in
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.780]   general. What is our relationship to the law? Well, he says, it is not what it once was.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.860]   There has been a change. He tells us how it came about, and he tells us the object and
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.300]   the purpose of it all. We would never produce fruit unto God unless that relationship had
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:29.420]   been changed, and we had entered into a new relationship. There is the first section.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:35.940]   Second section runs from verse 7 to verse 12. What is this? Well, this of course is
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:43.180]   a vindication of the law. What shall we say then? If that first statement is correct,
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.300]   somebody is going to say, well, very well, that means then that the law is sin. What
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.220]   shall we say then? Is the law sin? And the answer is, God forbid. And he proceeds down
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:02.620]   to the twelfth verse to vindicate the law in and of itself, and to show, of course,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.460]   that it is not the law that is responsible for our lack of fruit unto God. The trouble
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:15.020]   is not in the law, the trouble is in us. Now, as he left it in the first section, one might
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.780]   draw that deduction carelessly and foolishly and wrongly. Oh well then, there was something
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.900]   wrong with the law if it could not make us bear fruit unto God. Oh no, says Paul, the
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.980]   trouble was not in the law, it was in you. So he puts out this great vindication of the
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.780]   law itself. The law is something that has been given by God, and therefore the trouble
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.260]   is not in the law, the trouble is in us. Now he is going to say that in one great and mighty
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:47.020]   assertion in chapter 8, verse 3, for what the law could not do—why couldn't it do
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.900]   it?—in that it was weak through the flesh. Ah yes, but that is us. The weakness was not
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:59.060]   in the law, but in us. It was weak through the flesh. He is, in a sense, working out
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:06.120]   all that in this section, verses 7 to 12. And what we have in chapter 8, verse 3, is
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.820]   but a kind of summary again of the argument that he has already worked out. Now then,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:17.520]   that is the meaning and the purpose of the second section, verses 7 to 12. The trouble
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.060]   is not in the law, but in us and in our flesh. And then you come to the final section, verses
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:33.820]   13 to 25. What is this? Well, this is nothing but a working out, in a practical and in an
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:40.540]   experimental manner, of the statement that he has already been making in the two first
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.220]   sections. He wants to bring it right home. So he does not just leave it as a general
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:52.340]   principle. He says, now then, if we were still left under the law, this would be the position.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.820]   And he shows how utterly impossible it is. And then he will proceed in chapter 8, at
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.380]   the point where he left off at the end of verse 21, in chapter 5. Now there, I suggest
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:13.940]   to you, is the general division and subdivision of the contents of this famous chapter. In
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:22.700]   other words, the business of chapter 7 is to repeat and to reassert what he has said
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:29.820]   so grandly in chapter 5, verse 10. Which is this, "For if, when we were enemies, we were
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:37.260]   reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:45.140]   in his life." That's it. He said it there. That is the great statement. If while we were
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:49.940]   enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more being reconciled
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:58.140]   shall we be saved completely, entirely, fully sanctified, perfectly glorified, how? In the
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.940]   life of Jesus Christ. It's the only way. Nothing else can do it. There he has said
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.140]   it in 5.10. He repeats it here in 7.24, "Oh, wretched men that I am, who shall deliver
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:16.220]   me from the body of this death?" And the answer, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.340]   There's nothing new in that, you know. He'd said it all before. It's all there, back in
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:28.540]   chapter 5 and in verse 10. And, of course, as we indicated at the time, verses 12-21
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.260]   in chapter 5 are but an outworking of that fundamental statement in the tenth verse of
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:40.300]   chapter 5. And also, of course, we shall find, as we work our way through this chapter, that
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:46.300]   he is going to repeat a number of the things he said in chapter 6, and especially what
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.840]   he was saying towards the end, you remember, where he introduced this whole notion of fruit.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.220]   You remember the question in 21, "What fruit had he then in those things whereof ye are
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.960]   now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin and
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.700]   become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness and the end of everlasting life.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.820]   For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.820]   our Lord." Now then, I take it that we've got it clear
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:25.100]   in our minds as to what he's doing in this chapter. There is only one way of bearing
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:35.180]   fruit unto God, and that is to be married to, to be joined to, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:41.540]   To be married to the Lord means fruit unto death. There's only one way of bearing fruit
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:48.740]   unto God and to life, and that is to be married, to be joined unto the Lord Jesus Christ. He's
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.500]   going to prove that. He's going to prove why the Lord couldn't do it, why Christ can do
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.180]   it. That's what he's doing in this great chapter. Very well then.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:05.900]   So that we shall find that this is an amazing chapter in certain respects, and these are
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:14.220]   the important things about the chapter. It is, beyond any doubt at all, the profoundest
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:22.420]   analysis of sin and of its ways and of its effects and results, which is to be found
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:30.060]   anywhere in the whole of the Scripture. There is no more profound statement about sin, no
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.700]   more profound psychological analysis of sin and what it does and how it does it, than
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:44.700]   you will find in this great chapter. It is indeed quite incomparable in that respect.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:52.940]   It is also a mighty statement with respect to the function of the law and the place of
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:23:01.260]   the law in the life of the believer. Particularly, it is the greatest statement which we will
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:07.220]   find anywhere in the whole range of Scripture with regard to the final impotence of the
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:14.900]   law in the matter of salvation. So, we must keep our eye on that.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.260]   Another thing which this chapter does, and does so wonderfully, is this. It is beyond
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:32.460]   any question, I would say, the finest exposure and the most devastating criticism of the
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:40.260]   utter futility of people who think that morality alone is sufficient. There is no chapter in
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:49.540]   the whole Bible that shows the complete futility of believing in morality or in ethics, but
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.320]   shedding the Christian doctrine of salvation. There is no chapter that so demolishes that
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.220]   position as this one. It is, therefore, a chapter that is very much needed at this present
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.620]   time, as we have already, indeed, been seeing in anticipation in chapter 6. We are confronted
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.980]   today by numbers of people, as you know, who take up a very superior position—great intellects,
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.300]   great men. Are they no longer interested in Christian doctrine? Of course not. They do
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.820]   not believe in the miraculous. They do not believe in the substitution and atonement.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:25.020]   No, no, they have shed all that, but they are holding on to the Christian ethic. Here
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:33.540]   is the chapter of chapters in which they are made to be seen in the utterly ridiculous
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:41.420]   character which is rarely theirs. There is nothing which is so idiotic as to say that.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.460]   Of course, they are not familiar with the chapter. That is why they say it. They do
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:53.060]   not understand it. But it is the final refutation of this exaltation of ethics and morality
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:59.140]   at the expense of the doctrines of salvation. It is a glorious statement in that respect.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:05.760]   And finally, in many ways, it does put the doctrine of our relationship to the Lord Jesus
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:19.980]   Christ in its highest form, and certainly in its most mystical form. It is here we are
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.340]   taught—and, of course, we are taught it elsewhere, but it is put very plainly here—that
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:33.700]   we are married to the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the particular illustration, as we shall
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.020]   see, which the great apostle implies.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:45.420]   Now then, there are the leading themes, if you like, and it is so important that we should
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:53.740]   concentrate on these themes. These are the themes that constitute the message of this
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   great chapter. May I ask a question in passing? Had you realized that? Or had you thought
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.180]   that there was only one question in Romans 7, and that is this question, "Is this an
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.100]   unconverted man or a converted man? Is it Paul in some transitory stage, passing as
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.340]   it were from being unconverted to the glory of chapter 8?" Tell me, had you seen anything
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:21.780]   else in it but that? It is a tragic thing that people, because of a false intellectual
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:29.580]   interest, should rob themselves of the richness of this mighty chapter because of being preoccupied
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:36.660]   with just that one thing. How careful we should be in our handling of the scripture!
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.100]   I would assert, and venture to assert, that most of our troubles in the Christian life
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:47.580]   are due to our failure to grasp the teaching of this seventh chapter of the epistle to
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:54.340]   the Romans. Let me show you what I mean. I say that most of our troubles in the Christian
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:03.460]   life are due to our failure to grasp this teaching. Take this for instance. What a totally
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:11.380]   inadequate conception people have of sin these days. Have you noticed it? How little people
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.180]   talk about sin, how they dislike talking about sin. "Ah," they say, "we always want to
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.740]   be positive. Tell us about the salvation." Well, don't we needn't worry our heads about
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:30.580]   sin and the deaths of sin. And that is why so much of our modern Christianity is so superficial.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.380]   You see, there are people who spend their time always arguing about going over from
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.380]   chapter seven to chapter eight of Romans, who have never yet been into chapter seven.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.020]   They are very expert on this argument of going over from seven to eight, but they have never
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:49.980]   yet been in seven. They have never known the depth of sin within themselves. They have
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:57.740]   never known the power of sin, its awful tyranny and ugliness. This thing that is able even,
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:03.460]   as it were, to twist the law of God to suit its own end and which nullifies the law of
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:12.100]   God. What a terrible thing sin is. I say that most people seem to me to be in trouble at
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:18.940]   various points and at various times in their Christian life because they have never realized
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.580]   what a thing sin is. They thought, you know, that when they believed or took their decision
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.340]   or stepped forward, that it was all clear, they were all going to live happily ever afterwards.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:31.260]   And then, of course, they find themselves in certain troubles, and they don't understand
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:37.740]   this. Why don't they understand it? Because they have never understood sin. They have
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:43.580]   been rushed to an untimely birth. They have never really known repentance. They may have
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.060]   been told, you see, that you needn't worry about repentance, that will come later. That
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.140]   the great thing is to believe positively in the Lord Jesus Christ, but they don't understand
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.060]   why nor how, and therefore they are always in trouble later. They have never understood
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:04.060]   the teaching of this chapter on the depth of sin, the foulness of sin, the power of
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:11.940]   sin. But then look at it like this. Secondly, there are so many Christian people who are
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:18.340]   constantly in trouble about the law and about their relationship to the law. We'll have
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:23.460]   to come to this in detail. I'm just giving you a bird's eye view this evening. There
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:31.060]   are so many Christian people who will keep on putting themselves back under the law.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.980]   How do they do it? They do it like this. Here they are, they have believed in the Lord Jesus
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:42.180]   Christ, they are Christians, and then they fall into sin. And because they fell into
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:49.020]   sin, they begin to think, "Was I ever a Christian at all?" They become uncertain
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.660]   of their salvation. They not only lose their assurance, they even doubt whether they are
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.980]   Christians at all. And other people may feel the same thing about them. They say, "The
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.980]   man was never a Christian at all. If he was a Christian, he couldn't do a thing like
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.740]   that." What's that? Well, that, you see, is a complete misunderstanding of the relationship
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   of the Christian to the law. Every time they sin, they put themselves back under the law,
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.700]   and they are under condemnation again. A Christian should never do that. I'm going to make
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:21.860]   a statement which is, of course, going to be misunderstood. But let me say it. I must
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:27.340]   say it in order to expound the passage. I shall be slanderously reported for having
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:39.140]   said this. Like the great apostle, I was going to put it like this. It doesn't matter how
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:48.500]   deeply, how violently you may sin as a believer, you should never come under condemnation.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:53.060]   If you do, it's because you haven't understood your relationship to the law, and you've put
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.700]   yourself back under it again. "Now then," says someone, "you've incited everybody to
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:04.420]   go and sin as much as they like." I haven't. I really have done the exact opposite. Because
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:12.220]   if you only really understand this, it will give you great strength to withstand sin.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.740]   But I say it doesn't matter how much you sin, nor what the character of the sin, you must
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.300]   never put yourself back under the law. You must never have that condemnation again. There
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:26.340]   is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. That's how he's going
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.900]   to sum it up in the first verse of chapter eight. But that's the whole thrust of the
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.660]   entire argument. But wait a minute. There is another way in which Christian people often
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:45.020]   put themselves under the law, and it is this. When they fail to attain unto the standard
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:49.700]   which they find set out for the Christian in the New Testament—now this is positive,
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:55.540]   the former one was negative—they read this description of the Christian men, and they
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:01.660]   say, "I am not that. I haven't attained unto that." And then, because they haven't attained
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.940]   unto that, they begin to say, "Well, I wonder whether I'm a Christian at all. For if I
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.460]   were a Christian, surely I would be living like that." They begin to test themselves
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.860]   in the light of the Scripture, which is a good and a right thing to do. Yes, but where
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.580]   they go wrong is this. When they find that they haven't attained unto that standard,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.460]   instead of saying that they're poor Christians, they begin to say, "I'm not a Christian
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:32.500]   at all." They put themselves back unto the law. They have misused the tests of the Christian
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.620]   to condemn themselves. They are under condemnation again, and that means to be under the law.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.860]   But we must never be there. What the Apostle is concerned to show in this chapter is this,
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.460]   that we are dead to the law. We're finished with it. We are in a new marriage relationship.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.580]   Never again can we be back there. So whatever you do, or whatever you don't do, you must
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:58.300]   never go back unto the law. You must never again have this sense of condemnation. The
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.780]   moment you have a sense of condemnation, you're misinterpreting your relationship to the law.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:12.860]   That's what he's proving here. And oh, how common this is. How common is this in
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.540]   the experience of every pastor. He gets people coming to him along these two lines. Especially
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.140]   overtaking communion people come in on this point. Both of them, and especially the second
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.500]   and the positive one, they say, "I'm not fit, you know, to take communion. I'm not
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.260]   good enough. I really don't feel I'm good enough." You see, which is just the proof
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.580]   that they've never understood this doctrine truly. The answer to them is this, "Look
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.480]   here, you'll never be good enough." It isn't for people who are good enough. It's people
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.700]   who are not under the law, but under grace. It's people who are married to Christ. They
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:48.020]   come to his banqueting chamber and to his table, unworthy perhaps, but it doesn't matter.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:55.080]   They come as they are. And there they're reminded again that though they are what they
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.180]   are, they're no longer under condemnation because of his blood. They're reminded that
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.660]   they're united to him and belong to him and are in fellowship with him and can receive
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:09.940]   strength and power from him. They are the very people who should come. But you see how
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:16.780]   frequently people misunderstand these things. They don't understand truly their relationship
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:21.580]   to the law. Well, now, then, there is one great failure to appropriate the lesson of
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:31.300]   this chapter—people putting themselves back again under the law. But there is a second
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:37.660]   failure with regard to the law, and it is this. There are some people who misunderstand
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:45.700]   this teaching and what I've just been saying in such a way as to ignore the law altogether.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:52.580]   And they go headlong into antinomianism, which is a terrible state again. Ah, they say, "You
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.100]   are very right when you say that a man must never put himself under condemnation again."
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.220]   Absolutely right. And they interpret it like this, "Doesn't matter what I do. I can
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.420]   sin as much as I like. There's no condemnation for me. I'm safe. I'm secure." That is
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:11.140]   sheer antinomianism. They say, "It doesn't matter what you live nor what you do." They
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:17.380]   dismiss everything that the law states. That's an equally fatal misinterpretation of this
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:24.180]   teaching. So we shall have to pay very careful attention to that, and we shall have to define
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.620]   very closely what he means in verse 4 when he says, "Wherefore, my brethren, you also
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:37.980]   are become dead to the law." The exact interpretation of that is a most important matter. Many a
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:44.340]   man, I say, has gone headlong into antinomianism because he hasn't understood that. You see,
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:50.340]   there are always these two extremes. The fearful person who puts himself under the law and
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:56.580]   its condemnation. The bold, the brazen type who does the exact opposite and is guilty
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:06.420]   of that horrible thing, which is called antinomianism. Very well, there is the second group of troubles.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:14.300]   But the third is this. There are so many Christian people who are in trouble because they've
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:22.740]   never fully understood the doctrine and the teaching with regard to their union with the
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:30.380]   risen Lord. Now, as I reminded you just now, the apostle first stated that in verse 10
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:38.340]   of chapter 5, "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:51.300]   his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved in his life." In it, the union,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:58.820]   as we were in Adam, so we are in Christ. Now then, there it is, and he has been working
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:08.940]   it out in the remainder of chapter 5, you remember. The whole point, of course, is this,
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:19.580]   that it is the power of Christ that produces the fruit. It alone can do that. Thank God,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:25.940]   it does that. The first and the chiefest thing in the life
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:34.900]   of the believer, therefore, is this, is to realize his union with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:40.420]   He is joined to him, he is married to him, and what is his duty, what is the Christian
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.180]   to do? Well, the Christian, in a sense, has only one thing to do, and that is, it is to
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:59.580]   be faithful to Christ, to obey him, forsaking all other, to keep thee only unto him. It
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:06.620]   is the marriage pledge, the marriage vow. His is the power, his is the force that can
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:15.640]   produce the fruit, the seed. And our business is to realize our relationship to him, to
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:26.220]   be faithful to him, to keep ourselves only unto him, and to obey him implicitly, in all
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:31.860]   the details of our lives. Well now then, there are the great themes,
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.300]   and as I am saying, it is because so many Christians fail to realize that last thing
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:44.980]   also, that they are so constantly in trouble. You cannot be a Christian, as we have seen
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:51.100]   so repeatedly in chapter 6, without being united to Christ. He has used illustrations;
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:56.620]   he is going to use another. He wants to make it so perfectly plain. Every man who believes
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:04.300]   in the Lord Jesus Christ has been baptized into Christ, into his death, his burial, his
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:10.140]   resurrection, his ascended life. Reckon ye yourselves, therefore, to be dead indeed unto
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:15.300]   sin, and alive unto God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.660]   Now, we shall find that, as we work through this seventh chapter, the apostle, in a sense,
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.180]   just goes on repeating that. He puts it in a new way. It is now in our relationship to
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:33.700]   the Lord, but it is the same fundamental argument. And as he does it, I say, he introduces us
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:42.780]   to these great cardinal principles of the faith, and thereby saves us from so many of
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:50.500]   the diseases of the soul, so many of the failures in practical Christian living, so much unhappiness
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:58.860]   and lack of joy and of assurance. Very well. There, in general, is the scope and the ambit
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:07.620]   and the purpose, the object and objective, of this seventh chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:14.460]   to the Romans. And now, God willing, we shall proceed to take it section by section. First
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:23.500]   section, one to six. Second section, seven to twelve. Third section, thirteen to twenty-five.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:32.220]   But the fundamental object of it all is just this, is to prove that we can never bear fruit
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:47.100]   to God by the law. It is only by the Lord Jesus Christ. You cannot be justified by law,
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:55.780]   neither can you be sanctified by law. Amen.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:03.180]   O Lord, our God, we come again into thy holy presence to thank thee and to lift up our
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:13.260]   hearts in humble praise. We see anew and afresh that it is all of grace by faith. O God, we
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:20.500]   thank thee for it. We thank thee for the assurance, the certainty, the confidence. We thank thee
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:28.860]   for the sense of liberty that thy truth gives us. O God, forgive us that we so often misrepresent
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:36.500]   thee and thy blessed truth through putting ourselves back under the law. O forgive us,
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:44.940]   O Lord. We realize we thus make ourselves miserable and defeat ourselves and bring defeat
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:52.660]   into our lives. Open our eyes, O God, by thy Spirit to the truth, the truth which shall
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:42:02.420]   make us free, the truth which sanctifies. O God, receive our humble praise. We glory
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:09.380]   in the fact that we are in thy hands and that the power is the power of thy dear Son, our
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:15.580]   blessed Lord and Savior. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:21.380]   of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:29.500]   us now throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.460]   and evermore. Amen.
