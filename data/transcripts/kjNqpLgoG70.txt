[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - What role do young Christians play
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.800]   in leading and guiding a local church, a local congregation?
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.040]   It's a good question, especially in light
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.800]   of young Christians honoring older Christians.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800]   Here's the email, Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.520]   I am a young pastor in Missouri.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.960]   Lately, I've noticed older Christians in the church
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   appealing to 1 Peter 5:5.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.700]   It has been used to silence younger believers in the church.
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.980]   What should be the role of younger members of the church
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.340]   related to older members in, say,
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.660]   church business meetings, for example,
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.540]   when older members seek to shut down conversations
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.580]   and to avoid discussing uncomfortable topics?
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.980]   I would love your input on how to navigate
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.940]   through this sticky and confusing topic.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.900]   - It seems to me that most human cultures
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.820]   from around the world give evidence
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.060]   that something is written on the human heart
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.980]   to tell us that younger people should respect older people.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.220]   Now, by respect, I mean accord them a certain deference,
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.040]   a certain honor, a readiness to serve them
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.400]   and give serious attention to what they say.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.900]   And I think that's what the scriptures say.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.540]   For example, Leviticus 19.32 says,
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.900]   "You shall stand up before the gray head
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.360]   and honor the face of an old man,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.140]   and you shall fear your God, I am the Lord."
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.300]   And Paul cautions Timothy in the exercise
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.780]   of his pastoral authority toward older members.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.420]   He says, this is 1 Timothy 5.1,
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380]   "Do not rebuke an older man,
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.380]   but encourage him as you would a father.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.740]   Younger men as brothers, older women as mothers,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.100]   younger women as sisters in all purity."
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.020]   And I think that's Paul's way of saying,
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.340]   yes, young man, Timothy, yes,
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.840]   you have pastoral authority to guide
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.120]   and correct older people, but there's a way to do it.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   That shows a special respect for them as older.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.660]   Now, I start my answer to this question that way
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.240]   for this young pastor in Missouri.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   I start my answer that way
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   because I think this tone ought to color
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.220]   all our dealings in the church.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.180]   I think older people in the church should be treated
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.100]   with a peculiar kind of respect
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.020]   that is different from the young people.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.740]   Now, Peter says, "Honor all men, respect all men,"
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.860]   in 1 Peter 2.17.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.860]   And then he says, with the same word, "Honor the emperor."
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.260]   Now, all people should be honored
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.120]   or respected as human beings,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.340]   but that does not mean that all human beings
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.720]   should be respected in the same way.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.580]   Similarly, all ages should be respected,
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.360]   but an 80-year-old is not to be respected
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   only in the same way you respect a teenager.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.380]   But having laid that foundation
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.700]   that I think is really crucial for the culture
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.460]   or the ethos of a church,
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.320]   there is a clear and powerful stream in the Bible
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   that warns us against assuming old equals wise.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.880]   It doesn't.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.880]   It may, an older person may be wiser because of his age,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.040]   and it often does.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.600]   I mean, it should.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.200]   The old men gave good counsel to Rehoboam.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.600]   I just read this in my devotions this morning.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.840]   The old men gave good counsel to Rehoboam
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.640]   in 1 Kings 12, and the young men gave stupid counsel.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   Oh my goodness, the centuries-long horrors
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.960]   that came from that stupid counsel.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.480]   That's the way it is ordinarily, in fact, I would say.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.400]   Young don't have wisdom yet, and older people do,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.200]   but that's not always the case.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.700]   A long life should be a good teacher,
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.780]   should produce wisdom, and long study of God's word
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.880]   should yield a ripe mind and heart
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.860]   so that our older men ought to be the great repositories,
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.260]   and our older women ought to be
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.780]   the great sages of the church.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.540]   It should, and we ought to hope for it.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.340]   We ought to expect it, look for it.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.220]   But it is the case that often there are arrogant,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   stubborn, foolish, lazy, ignorant old men,
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.700]   and there are humble, patient, wise,
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.840]   diligent, knowledgeable young men.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.620]   We simply dare not equate age and wisdom
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.460]   or youth and folly.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.980]   The Bible is very clear that that is a wrong way to think.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.820]   For example, Psalm 119, 100,
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.660]   "I understand more than the aged,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.580]   for I keep your precepts."
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.420]   There's the reason why we dare not equate wisdom with age.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.180]   The word of God makes the key difference,
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.140]   not the years lived.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.140]   And there are some young men who have been shaped more
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.820]   and more deeply by the word than some old men
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.180]   who have been very neglectful of the word all their lives
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.300]   and are still in the church,
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.160]   and not as wise and as mature
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.720]   as people 30 years younger than they are.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.620]   For example, Jeremiah,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.860]   who is so hesitant to speak God's word
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.560]   because of his youth,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.720]   and God gets a little bit upset with him, I think,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.120]   in Jeremiah, he says,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   Jeremiah 1, 5, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   And before you were born, I consecrated you.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.480]   I appointed you a prophet to the nations."
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.340]   And then I said, "Oh, Lord God, but I'm only a youth.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.720]   I don't know how to speak."
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.060]   And the Lord said to me, "Do not say I am only a youth,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.080]   for to all I send you, you shall go."
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.640]   And whatever I command you, you shall speak.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.160]   Do not be afraid of them.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   I'm with you to deliver you."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.480]   That's a pretty strong word from God
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.520]   for a man who's saying, "I'm too young."
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.760]   Paul was just as concerned
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.880]   that Timothy would be cowed
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.440]   by his own youth
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.680]   as he was concerned that Timothy
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.400]   would be disrespectful of older people.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.820]   So not only did he say,
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.560]   "Encourage rather than rebuke older men,"
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.640]   he also said, "Let no one despise your youth,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.880]   but set the believers an example in speech,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.520]   in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.640]   In other words, do not let your youth
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.760]   keep you from ministering the word
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.980]   with power and courage to older people.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.080]   Two years into my ministry at Bethlehem,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.120]   this is 1982 now, I came in 1980,
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.800]   I came back from vacation in August of that year.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.820]   You can go find this message online.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.200]   I preached a message titled, "Let the Young Speak."
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.880]   And I remembered it after all these years
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.120]   because I felt it was a risky message.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.640]   Let the young speak.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.400]   The church was overwhelmingly older people,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.600]   wonderful older people, in fact.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.800]   I was 36 years old,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   but newer, younger people were streaming to the church.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.360]   And it would only be a matter of time
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.440]   till this, at that time, 113-year-old church, I think,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   would see young names on the ballots
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.200]   and young people at the business meetings
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.360]   standing up perhaps with something to say.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.320]   So I thought I should head off at the pass
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   any notion that only older people
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.480]   have biblical maturity and wisdom.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.920]   So I chose as my text, I can remember it so clearly.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.080]   I was in Georgia getting this sermon ready during vacation.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   I chose as my text Job 32, which is Elihu.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.480]   Elihu gets ready to speak and rebuke Job.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.480]   He's gonna rebuke Job.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.160]   He's gonna rebuke Eliphazad, Bildad, and Zophar
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160]   because he thinks all of them have got it wrong.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.400]   And I think Elihu's right.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.960]   I argue in the sermon that Elihu's a good guy.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.360]   He's not one of these bad teachers
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.640]   and there are all kinds of reasons for that.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.560]   But here's what that text says.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.560]   Now, Elihu had waited to speak to Job
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.320]   because they were older than he.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.800]   And when Elihu saw that there was no answer
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.080]   in the mouth of these three men,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.960]   he answered and said,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.840]   "I am young in years and you are aged.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.600]   Therefore I was timid and afraid
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000]   to declare my opinion to you.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I said, let days speak, let many years teach wisdom.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.880]   But it is the spirit in man,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.120]   the breath of the Almighty that makes him wise,
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.840]   that makes him understand.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   It is not the old who are wise,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.680]   nor the aged who understand what is right.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.160]   Therefore I say, listen to me.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.560]   Let me also declare my opinion."
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.160]   So I concluded that in that message
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   that being old and being young is not decisive
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.840]   in who is qualified for office
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.080]   or who has the greater wisdom.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.880]   The word of God decides,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.400]   the spirit of God decides what is wisdom.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.240]   On any issue we ask, what does the word of God say?
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.960]   Not how old is the speaker?
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   The elders in 1 Peter 5, 5 are the same.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.200]   Now this is my answer to how to deal with those folks
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.560]   that are misusing this text.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.480]   I think misusing this text that our questioner,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.400]   the pastor in Missouri asked about.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.160]   I think the elders in verse five,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.200]   to which the young are said to be submissive,
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.840]   are not just older people.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.480]   They are the same elders four verses earlier
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.080]   and they are pastors, they are officers.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   Pastor and elder are interchangeable offices
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.000]   in the New Testament.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.360]   So when the younger members are told
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.160]   to be subject to the elders,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.920]   it means that they should show a special deference
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.520]   to the pastoral leaders of the church.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.360]   But the most important exhortation
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.000]   is probably the second half of verse five,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.400]   which says, "Clothe yourselves, all of you."
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.760]   That means young and old, officers and laypeople,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.400]   "Clothe yourselves, all of you,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.360]   "with humility toward one another,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.520]   "for God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.680]   So the older people and the younger people
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.440]   should clothe themselves with humility.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.120]   And I'm just, I mean, looking back on those days,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.680]   those early days of my ministry as a 35, 36, 37 year old,
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.760]   surrounded by very old people,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.840]   that's what they were like.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.640]   It was just wonderful.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.360]   I think we both labored to clothe ourselves
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.240]   with humility toward each other.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.800]   And I think that means that in the church,
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.880]   both older and younger, will make every effort
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.560]   to submit their wills to the word of God.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.520]   It's not age and it's not youth
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.920]   that is decisive in settling what is true
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.480]   and what is wise.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.520]   It is the word of God.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.760]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.320]   And that old sermon, "Let the Young Speak," is online.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   It was preached 40 years ago now on August 29th, 1982.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.960]   And the whole thing is at desiringgod.org.
