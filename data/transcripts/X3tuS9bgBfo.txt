[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   Why was Russia so robust against, not initially, but eventually, so robust against pushing
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.440]   back against the Germans?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.360]   Despite losing tens of millions of soldiers, the government doesn't collapse like the
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.840]   czars did in World War I.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.340]   And not only that, but a communist country is able to produce these really advanced tanks
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.680]   in large and reliable numbers.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   There's so many mysteries there, like why central planning worked, why the government
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   didn't collapse, despite the fact that Stalin killed off so many of his people, he would
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.560]   have been hated.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.320]   Ah, but Hitler killed more and was more hated.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.440]   What you're thinking about is, what did the Russians do?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440]   I'm going to flip it.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.400]   What did the Germans do?
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.840]   A useful concept comes from the Samuel Griffith translation of Sun Tzu, which talks about death
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   ground.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.840]   What's death ground?
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.840]   It's when your enemy puts you on death ground, which means they're going to kill you.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.400]   And therefore, you have no choice but to fight.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.760]   Because if you don't fight, you're dead.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   And even if you fight, your odds are poor, but at least that's the only way you're going
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.800]   to get out.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.440]   The Ukrainians initially welcomed the Germans.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440]   Why?
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.640]   Because Stalin and friends had imposed the terrible famine of the early 1930s on them,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.160]   and they couldn't imagine that anything would be worse than that until they met Nazis, who
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.100]   then had them dig their own mass graves.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.320]   The Ukrainians rethought that whole thing.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.440]   And if you do this to people, you will conjure a formidable enemy.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.220]   So that's what happened to Russia.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.320]   You can see it happening to Ukraine now before your eyes.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.880]   Go back before the invasion of Crimea in 2014.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.360]   You've got Ukraine, which has a very corrupt government, and people were at sixes and sevens
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.240]   about whether they want to do Ukrainian things or Russian things.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.000]   Okay, fast forward to now where you have Russians blowing away the people who were most loyal
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960]   to them in the eastern part of the country who didn't leave.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.160]   Their apartment buildings are being leveled by Russians.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.640]   Ukrainians think, "Aha, you know this idea that we can coexist with these people is over."
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.040]   And our irony is Putin's forging Ukrainian national identity, and wars often do this.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   In the United States, we start out with our 13 colonies, and they're all very different
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.040]   after the Revolutionary War that starts forging a national identity.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.440]   And by the time you get to the end of the Civil War, where you have northern armies,
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.320]   at least those people have been all over the country, they have a real sense of nation
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.520]   by the end of that one.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.080]   It's interesting, because the strategy we pursued with Germany and Japan was unconditional
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   surrender.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.160]   Now, do you think of that as different than—obviously, we didn't commit genocide or anything—but
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.560]   do you think of that as different than the sort of total unlimited policy objectives
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.040]   that, for example, Germany had in Ukraine or Japan had in China?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   Or we also pursued unconditional surrender against the South in the Civil War, right?
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.600]   So how do you think about—because that's also something where your back is up against
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   the wall.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.120]   Why did that not result in the same kind of morale?
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.080]   Because the United States did not put the people of these countries on death ground.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.260]   The leadership had self-put themselves on death ground by where—basically, the problem
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.680]   for Tojo Hideki is if he backs down on anything, he's out of office, and then he doesn't
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   know what happens after that.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.800]   So he personally is on career death ground, and possibly he thinks—well, we were planning
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.040]   to—that he would get executed at the end of the war.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.400]   But the Japanese people eventually figured out that they weren't on death ground.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.200]   And in fact, the Japanese people were so exhausted by the whole thing that the society shattered.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.920]   But the United States was never going to put the German people, start massacring them in
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.020]   the way that the Russians massacred the Poles when they moved in, the Germans massacred
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.020]   the Poles.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.960]   How do you wind up with eight or nine million Polish deaths in World War II?
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   Think about that.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   It's a large number.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   It's because they're massacred.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   They're being massacred.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   [J.B.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.960]   WOGAN]
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   There was a firebombing of, you know, Tokyo and Dresden and Berlin.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.220]   I think it was in your book that 84,000 people died in that one night firebombing in Tokyo.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.220]   [GAYLE SMITH]
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   Yes.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220]   [J.B.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.220]   WOGAN]
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.400]   How did that not make them, put them in the mind frame of a sort of total death round?
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   [GAYLE SMITH]
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   Well, A, I don't know.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.100]   But B, Japan had been at war since 1931 in China.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.840]   They'd been sending large armies.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.980]   This isn't like recent U.S. wars, the counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.800]   This is they're sending hundreds of thousands of troops to occupy Manchuria.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.460]   The Chinese don't give up.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.900]   It goes on and on and on.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.940]   So by the time you're getting to 1945, it's a long time.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.940]   Also they had committed atrocities in China, and they knew all about it, and the atrocities
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.420]   got even better.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.880]   When there were wounded Japanese soldiers, their commanders ordered their fellow soldiers
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.620]   to execute them because they didn't want cripples going home.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.100]   They couldn't deal with them there.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.780]   And so rather than have the Allies pick them up, they executed them in place.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.340]   Can you imagine how Japanese soldiers felt about this?
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.340]   [J.B.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.340]   WOGAN]
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.140]   How do we explain the high morale, the famously high morale of the Japanese military, where
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.380]   they would refuse to surrender even after given orders by their superiors, despite knowing
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.540]   about these things that you're talking about?
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   [GAYLE SMITH]
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.540]   It's true.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.780]   It's because it's a different culture.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.340]   So in Japanese culture, you belong to in-groups or out-groups.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.100]   So the biggest in-group the Japanese belonged to was Japanese people and everybody else.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.780]   But within Japan, you come from a province, a locality, etc.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.300]   You go to school, education, various places.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.700]   You belong to a job wherever you have, and there are various units within your job.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.660]   And you owe loyalty.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.660]   It's obligations.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.960]   In the West, it's all about liberties and my rights.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.380]   In the East, it's about obligations to other people.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.660]   And so you owe obligations to all of these organizations.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.580]   And when soldiers are thinking about war, they're not thinking about grand strategy.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.980]   They're thinking about operational success.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.540]   So the moment you as a soldier start losing a battle, instead of in the West where you
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.300]   can retreat, you can surrender, and it's not dishonorable because you're going to live
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.780]   to fight another day, in Japan, you're a failure.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.620]   And therefore, if you go and come home back as a failed soldier, you bring dishonor to
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.100]   yourself, your family, your locality, anyone you are associated with.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.740]   So that's why it is so difficult for them to surrender.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.300]   However, by the time you get to the end of the war, they are so exhausted.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.380]   Think about it.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.580]   Their economy is, I don't know, I can't remember the statistics exactly, something like a tenth
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.780]   of our economy.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.900]   They have something like a thirteenth of our, I can't remember if it's coal or steel production.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.260]   And they don't have any local oil production.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.940]   They're importers of food and they're not getting that food.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.260]   So by the time you get to '45, they're exhausted.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.300]   And it's a shattering that occurs.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.500]   And finally, at the very end, you have Emperor Hirohito, who knew full well earlier, if he
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.020]   disagreed, and he didn't disagree for a long time, that he would be assassinated or proclaimed
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.940]   deranged and he had a perfectly good underage son to be used as a figurehead.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.760]   He knew that he couldn't do much about it.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.620]   At the very end, when he decided he was about to get nuked, that's when he intervenes to
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.380]   break the deadlock and at the cabinet meetings.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.480]   And there are a variety of people at the very top who realize it's over.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.700]   Could Hirohito have intervened earlier?
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.700]   I doubt it.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.860]   Let's go back more than five years.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.100]   If he intervenes when Japan is overextending in China, is there any chance that he could
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.100]   have succeeded?
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.420]   I doubt he thought of Japan overextending in China.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.740]   What expertise does he have?
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.740]   He liked guppies.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.460]   He liked studying fish in his backyard.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.700]   He has no expertise.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.960]   And then, of course, there's the hubris of it all, that we're going to dominate this
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   place.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.880]   And they look at the Chinese as an absolutely feckless backward place that's had all these
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.940]   warlord things going on.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:15.660]   And it doesn't dawn on them that by their extreme brutality in China, the Chinese finally
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.260]   get it going.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.260]   We're not the problem.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.940]   The Japanese are the problem.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:26.900]   And it is what the Japanese do that superglues China and is the great impetus to nation building.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.900]   You can see parallels with Hitler doing the same thing in Russia.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:40.140]   And also right now, Putin's busy canonizing Zelensky and creating a real nation out of
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.780]   Ukraine that's never going to forget these ongoing events.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.900]   Well, what I learned from your book that I thought was really interesting and also tragic
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.700]   because of the counterfactual was one of the strategies you suggested could have been that
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.940]   Japan could have, if it thought like a continental power, it could have allied with the Nationalists
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.860]   to beat the Communists in Russia, maybe waged almost a three-front war with Germany, the
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.380]   Nationalists, and Japan, beat the Communists, and prevented the Communists from taking hold
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.860]   in China.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.860]   And given the consequences of Communism in Russia and China, and how many lives could
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.780]   have been saved if, you know, I guess Hitler was beaten and then the Communists were beaten.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.180]   That Japanese choice just seems so tragic.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.740]   Let's say they do it.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.460]   That means Hitler forever.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.940]   And that means if you're anything but a nice Aryan, your days are numbered.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.620]   Certainly, it would have been the most massive ethnic cleanse ever in Europe.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:46.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
