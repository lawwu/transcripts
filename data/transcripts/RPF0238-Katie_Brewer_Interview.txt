[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.700]   Today I've invited Katie Brewer on the show, and I'm going to do my best in today's interview
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.700]   to get her to open up and share what it's actually like, so you can get a little bit of insight
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.900]   into the joys and the challenges of establishing your own independent financial planning firm.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:05.900]   [Music]
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.500]   This is a show where each and every day I work hard to try to give you some ideas,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.900]   some information, some inspiration, and some insight into how you can establish
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.700]   and pursue your own path to financial independence.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.300]   I know many of you are interested in financial planning as a profession,
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.700]   so today I'm trying to give you a behind-the-scenes tour of what it's actually like.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.200]   [Music]
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   Financial planning profession is a wonderful profession for a small percentage of the population.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   Many of you, it might be perfect for.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.500]   But one of the challenges of the financial planning profession is that it's very difficult
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   to actually understand what it's like until you're in it.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.700]   Once you get into it, you'll actually get it a little bit better.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.000]   And this is one of the challenges that I faced when I was becoming a financial planner,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.300]   is it's hard to get inside information.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.100]   What happens is when you trot around, you'll meet with the recruiters,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100]   you'll meet with all kinds of people, but all the people that you meet with
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   are trying to get you into the business.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   And it's very difficult to get an accurate assessment of what the business is actually like.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.600]   And so one of my little pet goals with Radical Personal Finance is to try to interview financial planners
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   and have them share what the business is actually like.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.100]   I've noticed that in the online – well, I guess I shouldn't even just say online.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100]   Many times in the media space, there's a distance of communication
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   between financial planners and the general public.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   There's a distrust on many people's parts because oftentimes they don't understand
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.100]   what the financial planning business is like.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.600]   There's also a press that's happening right now, and I'm very encouraged by it.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   There's a press of young financial advisors who are establishing their own firms.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.100]   In fact, as this interview goes live, the moment I planned it to go live on Tuesday, September 15, 2015,
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   this is the first day of the XYPN 2015 conference.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.600]   I am speaking at the XYPN 15 conference.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.100]   I'm actually speaking on Thursday morning.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100]   But the conference begins on Tuesday, September 15.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.100]   And the XYPN organization – in the past, I've had the co-founders on the show at different times,
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.600]   Michael Kitsis and Alan Moore.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.100]   I've interviewed both of them.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.100]   But the XYPN organization supports financial advisors who are establishing their own independent fee-only practices.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.100]   And this is a market move that I am thrilled about.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.600]   I think it's definitely a niche that has a tremendous amount of opportunity and it can work very, very well.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   But it's also in many ways fairly new and it's untested in a lot of ways.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.100]   And it doesn't quite have the track record that many of the larger established firms have where they can look back and say,
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.100]   "Oh, look. Here, we've launched thousands of financial advisors' careers."
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.600]   So I'm doing my little part to try to support this community being involved in XYPN.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   I'm doing my part to try to bring some of these advisors.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.100]   It helps people like Katie.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.600]   It helps some of the past advisors to have a little bit of exposure for their firms.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   And also, I think it's useful for many of you to hear what the actual business is like.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   So for those reasons, I've invited Katie Brewer on the show.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Katie is a wonderful lady.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.100]   Her business is based in Dallas, Texas.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.600]   And we recorded this interview in Fort Worth, Texas at the Podcast Movement 2015 conference.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   So with that, here we go.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   Katie, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   Hi. I'm so glad to be here.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   So I don't invite many financial planners on the show.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   So you should feel honored.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   I know. You're the expert and you're like, "Hey, I'm the expert and I'm going to ask the expert about expert-y things."
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.100]   Well, it's part of one of my goals with Radical Personal Finance is to demystify the world of financial planning.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:10.100]   And when I was an active practitioner, what always frustrated me was the fact that financial planners didn't seem to be very good at articulating and getting things across to the general public.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.100]   So there was like personal finance and then there was financial planner lingo, but there's nobody crossing it.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   Oh yeah, there's like two different universes.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100]   Right, exactly.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.100]   What do normal people understand and then what do financial planners communicate?
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.100]   There's this weird gray space in the middle.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.100]   Exactly. No one crosses the gray space.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.600]   So I determined, I said, "With Radical Personal Finance, I'm going to cross the gray space."
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   And so what I love to do, basically what I want to do is tear the curtain down from in front of everything in financial planning.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.100]   And so people often are arguing against lies in the sense that the things they're against, they don't actually have the facts.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.600]   They don't know how the firms work. They don't know how the business works.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.100]   They don't know how the planners work. They don't know how the jobs go.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:56.600]   And so you get uncomfortable client-planner relationships often because they just don't understand what's going on on the other side.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   So my goal is that, among other things, to provide a bit of a platform for financial advisors to be able to share with other people what's actually going on.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   So your story with regard to financial planning, how did you wind up in this business?
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.100]   Well, I decided I wanted to get into financial planning when I was in college, but I did not have a business degree.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.100]   I actually decided to get a biology degree and then go into financial planning.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.100]   So that's serving me really, really well in the world of financial planning.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.100]   I could tell you all kinds of things about different processes of the body.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.100]   Actually, probably at this point I can't. It's been way too long.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.100]   Why did you actually study that? If you knew that you wanted to do a business-y type of thing, why did you finish the degree?
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.100]   I didn't know I wanted to do a business-y type of thing until my senior year.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:51.100]   And the only reason that I actually took a finance class was because I was scared to death that I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.100]   And I looked at my parents and I said, "Well, they kind of have an idea of what they're doing, but not really."
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.100]   And not enough to be able to teach me anything, rather than, "Hey, don't do what we're doing."
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.100]   And I'm like, "Well, I don't even know what you're doing."
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.100]   So I took a personal finance class that was really just for me personally.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   And it was a semester long. I don't even think I got credit for it, because I was a biology major and I had probably used all of my electives at that point.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:23.100]   But I decided to take it because I wanted to have my own personal... I wanted financial freedom.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   I wanted to know what the heck I was doing.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.100]   So it was a four to five month long class and I loved it so much that I was like,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   "Well, now that I'm almost done with my degree, I think I want to go into financial planning
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.100]   and teach other people about all of these amazing things that I just learned."
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.100]   Was the course geared toward the students or was the course geared towards becoming a practitioner?
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.100]   It was actually geared towards both.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.100]   It was a certified financial planner that taught the course.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:59.100]   And so it would probably be the very first course of the CFP study if they were to do it in that manner.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.100]   And was it just fairly mainstream? Just kind of mainstream advice?
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   Yeah, I mean a lot of it was, "How does the stock market work?"
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.100]   Okay, well we're going to teach you, but then you're going to actually open up a sample portfolio
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   and you're going to track a stock over a couple of months.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.100]   And then we learned all about insurance. We learned about how to actually budget.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.100]   And I mean, these were things that I feel like every high schooler should really be learning.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.100]   And at least every college student.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.100]   But it's amazing how many people get out of all of those structured educational environments
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.100]   and still don't have the base level knowledge of their finances.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.100]   It's really remarkable because if you total up the amount of time we spend studying biology
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.100]   in high school and college...
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.100]   And geography! Because that came in handy.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.100]   So if you total that up and you consider that,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.100]   and then you total up the amount of time that you're taught about personal finance,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.100]   and then you fast forward to "real life,"
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.100]   and you think about how much you actually spend using personal finance knowledge versus biology,
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.100]   it's a little out of whack in my opinion.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:17.100]   It is. I'm a big proponent of actually having some sort of structured classes.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.100]   I live in Texas, and in Texas they're finally starting to move towards this.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.100]   I had a friend that's a teacher who told me that her middle school math class
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.100]   is actually learning personal finance as part of their math class.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:36.100]   And it made me so happy. I was like, "Yes! Finally somebody's actually teaching about real life along with math."
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.100]   Right. That's fantastic. So after that, you graduated with a biology degree. Where then?
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.100]   So I had decided at that point that I was just going to stick my foot in the door somewhere.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.100]   That I really wanted to be in this industry.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   I didn't know anything about the industry.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.100]   And I didn't know anybody in the industry.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.100]   Both of my parents have worked for the state of Texas for their entire working career.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:04.100]   So I stuck my foot in the door at a firm that likes to set up in strip malls
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.100]   and sell mutual funds to people.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.100]   I won't tell you which one it is, but I bet you could probably guess which one it is.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.100]   It was really interesting because I didn't do very much advising at all.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   I did a whole lot of wandering around neighborhoods and knocking on people's doors
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:25.100]   so that I could ask them if they had any old 401ks that they wanted to put with me.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.100]   I would imagine you learned something.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   I learned that it is really, really interesting to try to get random strangers to trust you and give your investments.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.100]   Now the thing about this model, and this company is known for this model,
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.100]   they claim it still works.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.100]   And that's why it's taught. And it's an effective form of prospecting.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   So you went in that model and then did you quit or what happened?
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.100]   I was there actually for about two years.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.100]   And when you come in and you have this idea of what you want to be doing for people.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.100]   Like I want to be able to help them with questions that they have.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.100]   But then you're only getting paid off of stuff that you sell.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   And so very quickly that was a problem for me.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   So I was like I want to be able to try to go somewhere else
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.100]   where I can actually be able to sit on the same side as the client.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.100]   And if they have questions I want to be able to answer them and not have to do it for free
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.100]   hoping that they will buy something from me.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.100]   What then? After that?
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   I've been a couple of different places.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.100]   That's what I'm interested in is to bring out the career trajectory.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   Because when I was looking at getting into the financial planning world,
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.100]   it's a very opaque industry.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.100]   And the problem is that the primary path of information is speaking with a recruiter.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:49.100]   And most people aren't aware of the different models, the different perspectives.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.100]   And so you start meeting with recruiters.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.100]   And that's excellent. They can be an excellent source of information.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.100]   But how many are you going to meet with?
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.100]   Two, three, four? Maybe?
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.100]   And do they have your best interest in mind?
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.100]   And that's always the challenge.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.100]   And so that's what I'm interested in is actually your model, your path through it.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.100]   So after that, then what?
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.100]   So I went from the strip mall financial advisor firm.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.100]   I joined a different firm that did do financial planning.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.100]   So that part of it was great.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.100]   But they only wanted us to focus on wealthy business owners.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.100]   Which, rewind back, I said both of my parents worked for the state of Texas.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.100]   We don't really fall into the wealthy business owner environment.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.100]   And by then you would have been, what, 24?
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.100]   Yeah, I think I was like 25.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:37.100]   At 25, I'm supposed to be cold calling people worth millions of dollars
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   and being like, "You don't know me. And I don't know you.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   And I'm really young, but you should meet with me."
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.100]   And they were like, "What? No. Stop calling me."
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.100]   So it was also a very sales-heavy model, which was not really ideal.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.100]   But when you come into this industry and you don't have any experience,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.100]   sometimes that's where you kind of have to get your feet wet, unfortunately.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.100]   And I never really thought I was all that great at sales.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.100]   Because if I don't believe in something, it is very hard for me to convince anybody.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.100]   I am just very cut and dry.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:15.100]   It's very hard for me to say, "Oh, you should do this," if I don't 100% believe in it.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.100]   So that was interesting. Not all that fruitful.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   The sales trainers talk about sales as a transfer of belief.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.100]   And I don't think anybody should ever sell anything.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.100]   Number one, they don't believe in it.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.100]   And number two, they don't believe it's the right fit for the client at this point in time.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.100]   It's just completely ineffective.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   Because you can't transfer that belief.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.100]   I was talking yesterday with somebody, and we were talking about sales,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.100]   about hard selling versus soft selling.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.100]   I was saying, "I have no problem in the world hard selling, if I'm selling in the right place."
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.100]   Because what I mean by hard selling is vigorously representing that,
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   "I believe your life will be improved by this.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.100]   And if I believe your life will be improved by this,
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.100]   I'm going to tell you strongly and vigorously with as much enthusiasm and persuasion as possible,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.100]   I think your life will be improved."
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.100]   But on the flip side, if I don't think your life is going to be better, that's it.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.100]   I'm going to tell you, I don't think your life is going to be better.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.100]   It's the only way to effectively do sales.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.100]   I'm a big fan of hard selling budgeting these days.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.100]   And hard selling savings and investing.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.100]   And that's where it's funny because, I don't know about you,
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   and we'll talk a little bit about your financial planning process,
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.100]   but one thing I learned working with clients was,
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.100]   I learned where to be persuasive and where not to be persuasive.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:38.100]   So one of the mistakes I made early in my career is I was very persuasive about a financial product.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.100]   And so I would, whether it's a life insurance policy or a mutual fund,
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:50.100]   I could sell you like crazy on putting $480 a month, whatever the number is, into your mutual funds.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   It was only this much of your income.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.100]   And I can run a financial calculator like magic and I can say,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.100]   "Look, if you put $5,000 a year in your Roth IRA and you do this over time, look, you're going to be a millionaire."
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.100]   And what I learned was that I was excited about that.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.100]   That's what always got me excited, reading personal finance books and saying,
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   "Well, Joshua, if you just fund a Roth IRA for 40 years, you'll be a multimillionaire."
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.100]   That got me excited.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:22.100]   So I took that lens of personal finance to professional finance and I sold clients on mutual funds.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   And then two and a half months later, "Joshua, I can't do $5,000 anymore.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   We've got to drop this down to $100 a month."
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   And I learned over time that I made the mistake of being too persuasive on the wrong thing.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.100]   But when I learned to be persuasive over the concept of planning in general, budgeting in general,
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:45.100]   having a plan, having goals, having vision, then the client didn't face buyer's remorse of saying,
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:51.100]   "Oh, I wish I hadn't put $480 a month there because now I'm broke and I can't go out to eat and I hate Joshua Sheets."
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.100]   Rather, it's, "No, Joshua encouraged me to budget."
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:02.100]   And I was able to build that emotion but not build the emotion around the thing that potentially was going to be too much.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.100]   Yeah. I think there's a big difference between selling a financial product and selling a financial process.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.100]   Because I feel like with my clients, if I'm selling anything,
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:18.100]   it's kind of selling that they need to address maybe an issue that's a little bit uncomfortable
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.100]   or one where they've been putting it off for a long period of time.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.100]   But once we get to that and I can help them through it with guidance,
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.100]   they can get back onto the path to financial freedom.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:37.100]   And so I don't really feel like I have to say, "You have to do A or B."
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.100]   I mean, there's a lot more figuring out what's important to people and then saying,
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:47.100]   "Okay, well, right now you're doing A, B, C, and D, but really you can't afford to do all these things.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:53.100]   So let's really pick what's important and let's focus on that and then check it off the list and then we'll move to the next thing."
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.100]   And that's what I love, and we'll get quickly to your practice model that you're pursuing now,
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.100]   but that's what I love about selling financial planning itself as a product.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.100]   Because you can vigorously sell the benefits of the process,
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   and then once the client has bought the benefits of the process,
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.100]   they've stroked the check or they've established the first withdrawal or they've made the commitment to,
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.100]   "Okay, we're going to do this process."
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:23.100]   Then you never have to worry about pressing on those things, and it's purely a coaching consultant model.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:29.100]   And that changes things, because you do have to, I think, vigorously sell the process as being valuable,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.100]   but there's no potential conflict of interest.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.100]   I'm convinced that I can't imagine how somebody couldn't reap multiple, multiple times the value of the monthly fee
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.100]   so that you can sell and feel really good about it.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   So how many more firms until you ended up doing what you're doing now?
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.100]   That's a really good question, but I think it was like one per year
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.100]   until I finally decided that I had tried out all of the different models in financial planning.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:06.100]   None of them actually addressed younger people in a way that aligned the advisor with the client, in my mind.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:12.100]   And so I eventually decided that I was going to open my own firm last year.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.100]   And now it's done.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.100]   And now I'm celebrating my one-year firm anniversary.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.100]   You survived. Now you've just got to survive two more.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.100]   Yeah, just two more.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:26.100]   Then four more to get to the five years, and then you're pretty much there.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:32.100]   So tell me about your process and essentially what you're focusing on as an advisor.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.100]   So I tend to focus on working professionals.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:42.100]   I really like working with the 20-, 30-, 40-year-olds that are in a job right now.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   And so a lot of them have actually pretty good financial knowledge.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.100]   They're usually well-educated.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.100]   And what's funny is that whenever we start talking, a lot of them are actually embarrassed that they're so well-educated,
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:01.100]   but that they don't feel like they know enough about their own finances.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.100]   I even have some people who went to school for finance,
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.100]   but when you go to school for finance, you learn a whole lot about corporate finance.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.100]   You learn very little about personal finance,
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.100]   unless you're going to a program that's a personal financial planning program.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.100]   So I find that a lot of them are actually feeling like they haven't addressed it as much as they should,
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.100]   or they haven't put it as a priority as much as they should.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.100]   And sometimes they're embarrassed that they don't know what they don't know.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   But I always encourage them that really this is the best step that they could possibly be taking,
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.100]   is to identify that they don't know what they don't know, and to go get help with it.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.100]   So what are some of the unique attributes of this demographic
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.100]   that make it different than other financial planning scenarios?
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:51.100]   I find a lot of financial planners that are my peers within the financial planning industry
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.100]   tend to focus on retirement planning as a really big goal.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.100]   Really important A1, before we talk about anything else, let's talk about when you're going to retire.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.100]   Of course it is. What else is there?
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.100]   What else is there? It's crazy.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.100]   Either you talk about insurance, you talk about retirement, you talk about investment.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.100]   What I find is that my working professional demographic,
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.100]   they always come to me with a lot of different things that they're trying to accomplish.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.100]   And so it's more of a juggling act with them.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.100]   It's not necessarily, "I'm five years away from retirement, and I want to know if I can retire."
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:30.100]   It's, "I'm trying to balance the fact that I've got this lifestyle that I'm trying to uphold,
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.100]   but I'm also trying to be a good steward of our family money,
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   and I want to make sure that my kids are going to be well taken care of.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   I want to make sure maybe someday I can retire."
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:47.100]   But actually, that's number six or seven on the list of all of the other things that I want to talk about.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:59.100]   In your experience working in this professional demographic,
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:05.100]   is retirement even, as far as the concept of retirement,
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.100]   in the way that other generations have talked about it,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   retirement at 65 with a pension, is that even, when you actually dig down into it,
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.100]   is that even a goal on anybody's list?
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.100]   For some people it is.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:26.100]   I tend to work less with business owners and more with people that are still in a traditional workforce.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.100]   But it is a little bit different, and then a lot of them are trying to balance
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.100]   that future enjoyment of life with the current enjoyment of life.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:41.100]   Sometimes I'll run across people that they might make a really good income,
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.100]   and they might have a fancy job, and they might hate it.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:51.100]   Part of our financial plan is actually how to build up enough financial independence
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.100]   so that they can leave that job if they decide that they don't want to do it anymore.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.100]   Maybe even just leave that entire field and start something completely different.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:07.100]   I find this is what's missing from most of the financial planning world.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:12.100]   You look through the CFP board curriculum, it's got all kinds of things to say about asset allocation
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:19.100]   and figuring out what's the sharp ratio of a portfolio.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.100]   Realistically, though, the things that people are majoring on,
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.100]   are they important? I guess, but in the right context.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.100]   But in terms of the actual quality of life for most people,
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   the fact that you work a job that you like is very different,
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.100]   has a much bigger impact on your lifestyle and your enjoyment of life
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:47.100]   than is your portfolio perfectly optimized for the lowest possible standard deviation.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:55.100]   This was something I figured out in my career, I would say three or four years in,
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   when I was starting to make a transition.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   I realized all this formal financial planning stuff, yeah, I got to know it,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.100]   but it's kind of irrelevant to the client. They don't need to know it.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:15.100]   I remember when I first started presenting investment portfolio selections
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.100]   and I would drag people through all of the Morningstar analysis
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.100]   and I would go through every bullet point.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.100]   When you first start, you're so excited, you're like,
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   "Please let me tell you everything that I know."
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   By the end of the appointment, these people are looking at you
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.100]   like you just hit them with a train.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.100]   You're just like, "So is this exciting?"
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.100]   They're like, "I have no idea what just went on in the last hour."
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   I see a lot of pretty pictures, but I don't understand any of those terms.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:46.100]   I learned to quit doing that and focus on lifestyle goals,
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.100]   stuff that was very tangible.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   All of a sudden, it completely transformed it.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.100]   In my mind, that's what we as financial planners...
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   It's almost like, "Okay, you got to pass the CFP as your basis of entry. Great.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   Now, go spend a couple years studying life coaching."
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   Because in reality, the most effective financial planner is a life coach.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.100]   I absolutely agree with you.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.100]   It's been really interesting, especially with this demographic,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.100]   that some of the things in the CFP curriculum,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.100]   there's actually nothing in there that talks about student loans,
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.100]   the different types of student loans, the different payment plans,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.100]   federal student loans versus private student loans.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.100]   These are all things that I had to essentially self-educate
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.100]   when I started working with this demographic,
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.100]   because they have questions that are very relevant to that.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   I feel like as the interpreter of difficult financial information,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.100]   that I needed to have a background in that as well.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.100]   In starting your firm, talk to us a little bit about...
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   How's it been? Honestly, how's it been over the last year?
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.100]   It's been really, really good.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.100]   I've had a lot of people...
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.100]   I feel like I have a cheering section, which is really amazing,
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.100]   both within the industry and outside of the industry.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.100]   It has been really interesting, because I actually have had some conversations
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.100]   with people that were interested in my services.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.100]   I talked to them, and they said, "Well, it's not really a good fit for me right now,
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.100]   but I'm going to be back.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   But in the meantime, I just wanted to tell you that I think it's really amazing
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.100]   what you're doing, and that there's really nobody else out there.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.100]   I've been looking for this for 10 years, and I just wanted to say thank you."
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.100]   I'm like, "Well, you're welcome."
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.100]   But you can also write a check.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   But you can also go ahead and sign up if you wanted to.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   It's really been great in that I've had other financial planners
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   that have kind of the same thoughts.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.100]   They're like, "What you're doing is really brave.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.100]   We have no idea, Katie, how you're going to make money."
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.100]   Which I laugh. I'm like, "That's what a business plan is for, FYI."
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.100]   The business plan is not just work with rich people and manage their assets.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.100]   It works great.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   But even some of those financial planners,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.100]   they're really big advocates of what I'm doing.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.100]   That's really great, because a lot of times they will run across people
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.100]   that don't necessarily fit their business model,
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.100]   but they know that they fit my business model.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.100]   I've actually had quite a few other financial planners that refer people to me.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.100]   They're like, "Hey, I talked to this person briefly.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.100]   I think you would be a really good fit for what they're looking for,
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   and I wanted to connect the two of you."
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.100]   What's been the biggest objection?
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.100]   As you transitioned from selling products,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.100]   which all have their own unique objections,
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.100]   to selling process,
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.100]   what's been the biggest objection as far as why prospective clients
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   don't sign the client agreement?
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.100]   What's been really interesting is that it's actually pretty difficult
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   to explain to people that they will save money by paying you.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.100]   Right.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   Because until you really dive into their information,
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.100]   it's not like you can start just randomly making suggestions and being like,
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   "Well, if you did this, then that would save you $200 per month."
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:08.100]   So it's really hard to put it into a tangible thing that you're like,
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   "If you invest this money to put your financial plan in place,
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.100]   you will see this type of return out of it."
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.100]   Right.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.100]   So that has been a little bit challenging,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.100]   because sometimes people really know that they need help,
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.100]   but they're just not quite ready to pay how much it costs
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.100]   to work with a fee-only financial planner.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.100]   So that has been a little bit interesting,
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.100]   because they're like, "Well, the reason that I'm talking to you
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   is because I make a really good income,
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.100]   but I'm still struggling with my monthly budget."
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.100]   Right.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.100]   So it seems counterintuitive to them to pay somebody for anything.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.100]   Right.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.100]   Much less pay somebody to help them with finances
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.100]   when they're struggling with their finances.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   Right.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   How much are your fees, and what are they based on?
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.100]   Are they flat?
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.100]   What's your fee structure?
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.100]   I do an upfront fee, and that has a pretty big range.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.100]   How much?
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.100]   So it's between $750,000 to $3,000.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.100]   So that covers the financial roadmap.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.100]   I call it a financial roadmap,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:16.100]   because if you do a financial plan for a 35-year-old in four months, probably,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.100]   it will be completely irrelevant,
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.100]   because they found out that they were pregnant with a second kid,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.100]   or one of them got a promotion,
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.100]   or they decided to move all the way across the country.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.100]   So we do a financial roadmap,
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.100]   and that kind of gives us a really good idea of where we are right now
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.100]   and then where we're trying to go to.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.100]   But then we also do ongoing adjustments to that.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.100]   So I'll do an upfront fee, which kind of covers the "We're here,
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.100]   and we're going to go over here."
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.100]   And then I do an ongoing monthly fee, which also has a range.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   It's between $75,000 to $300,000
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.100]   for that ongoing adjustment of the financial plan,
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.100]   as well as check-in meetings and accountability.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.100]   And then people have access to me to be able to ask questions whenever.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   So anything that normally they would say their benefits changed,
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   or there was something added at work,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.100]   normally they would look at it and be like, "I have no idea what this means,
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   and so I'm actually just not going to deal with it."
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.100]   It might be something that was really valuable to them,
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.100]   but because they didn't have time,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.100]   and it was something that was stressful,
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.100]   and they don't really understand it, maybe they passed on it.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.100]   So people that are working with me can essentially say,
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.100]   "Hey, Katie, I've got this thing at work,
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.100]   and they're adding on this new benefit.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.100]   Could you look it over for me?"
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   They just shoot off an email to me,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.100]   or we use our secure client vault to share that information.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.100]   I'll look it over for them,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.100]   and then as the interpreter of complex financial information--
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.100]   I like that. Good branding. That's good.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.100]   I will come back to them and say, in very simple, plain language,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.100]   "This is what this is.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.100]   Either you need it or you don't need it,
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.100]   and I would suggest that you do this."
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:02.100]   In my mind, you're right about it's hard to articulate what you're going to do.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.100]   I was talking with somebody about tax planning recently,
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.100]   and they wanted to hire me to do tax planning.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:16.100]   I've done almost no hiring out.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.100]   I'm not licensed. I don't have an RIA,
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   so I can't do anything with investments or insurance.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.100]   But I was like, "Okay, I could do a little bit of consulting on some tax planning."
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.100]   We're talking about what can you do,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.100]   and we were talking it through.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   I was just struck by how we're trained, I think, in our culture.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.100]   We're trained to look for the one thing, the one solution.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   That magic bullet that, "Oh, there's a secret."
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   It's like the secret of success, the secret of becoming a millionaire,
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.100]   the secret of money that you haven't been taught.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.100]   There is no secret. There is no secret. There is no secret.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.100]   There's just the same old boring principles that you have been taught,
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.100]   but that you haven't done.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.100]   Then there's the proper application of those things in your specific situation.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   There's no one thing. There's many things.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.100]   That second one is actually really important,
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.100]   because I find a lot of my clients actually come to me and say,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.100]   "I've read this. I've read this. I've read this. I've read this.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.100]   Then I saw this on TV."
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   There's five different ways that they could go.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.100]   They're like, "I have all this knowledge,
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.100]   and I have no idea which direction I'm actually supposed to go in,
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.100]   because I have no idea how that actually applies to my situation."
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.100]   That's one thing that I find,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.100]   especially working with the younger professionals,
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.100]   working professionals,
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   is that a lot of times they'll have the knowledge.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.100]   It's not like they're hiring me to be the first person
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.100]   that ever teaches them about whatever.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.100]   They're hiring me to help them cut through all the clutter
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.100]   and figure out exactly what they need to be doing,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.100]   what are the steps that they need to do,
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.100]   and then how do we keep accountable with that.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.100]   You can go online and learn all about your disease.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.100]   Or you can have a doctor say, "We're going to do these tests,
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.100]   and if they're good, they're going to diagnose it properly."
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.100]   There's a time at which going online is the best thing to do,
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.100]   and then there's a time at which going to the doctor is the best thing to do,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.100]   and you've got to differentiate between those things.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.100]   As I've considered it, in my mind,
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.100]   this is the biggest disease that we have in our culture,
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.100]   is looking for the one thing,
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.100]   and looking for the secret, and looking for the magic thing.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.100]   It doesn't exist.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.100]   It doesn't exist in tax planning.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.100]   Tax planning is hundreds of little things in specific situations.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   It doesn't exist in financial planning.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100]   You can't possibly know what you're going to tell someone
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.100]   until you go through a comprehensive fact-finding process.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.100]   It's not just filling out a questionnaire.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.100]   It's pushing back on the questionnaire
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.100]   and saying, "Okay, you've got these questions.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.100]   You've got these goals, but now, are these really your goals?"
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.100]   Then 45 minutes later, "No, those actually aren't my goals.
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.100]   I just thought I wanted to retire because that was what society says,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   but in reality, I want to open a hair salon."
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.100]   Okay, well, that's a very different scenario of doing it.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.100]   There are a lot of people who've gotten rich at hair salons,
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   and there are a lot of people who have made a little bit of money on hair salons,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.100]   and there's some people who've gotten broke.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   Now our financial planning is going to be a little bit of a different scenario.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   That's also why we do the financial roadmap that is always subject to change.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.100]   Right.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.100]   I don't want people to feel like just because they decided one time
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.100]   that this is the direction that they're headed,
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.100]   that they're locked into that
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.100]   because that's what they decided with their financial planner.
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.100]   So I always tell them, "This is our loose structure
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.100]   for figuring out what we need to be doing going forward."
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.100]   But at any point in time, we can always change this.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   That's the value of working with a financial planner on an ongoing basis.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.100]   What is the most frustrating personal finance that you see taught out
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   in the personal finance space that just--
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.100]   What's the phrase? Gets your wagon.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   What's the thing that just really upsets you of the personal finance advice?
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.100]   Are you talking about personal finance advice that's given to the masses?
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.100]   I would say--
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.100]   What's funny is that I actually--
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.100]   Some of the big talking heads of finance,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.100]   I think they're actually pretty straight on.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.100]   I don't disagree with a lot of what they say.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.100]   What aggravates me a little bit is that they don't have a good disclaimer to say
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.100]   just because I'm telling you this
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.100]   doesn't mean that it's specific to your exact situation.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   Sometimes I do see people that are trying to do the right thing,
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.100]   but because they're trying to utilize some out-of-the-box
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.100]   or they read a book or whatever,
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.100]   and they're trying to implement that even though it's completely irrelevant
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.100]   to their personal situation.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.100]   I think that's the biggest thing where it's like,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.100]   "Okay, well, sometimes you have to take it with a grain of salt
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:55.100]   that just because it worked for other people,
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.100]   that it would exactly work that way for you."
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.100]   I wish every book, every article, every magazine came with the
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:06.100]   "It depends" disclaimers up front, not on the end.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.100]   The disclaimers that I would like to see is,
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.100]   "If this, if this, if this, if this, then this advice is applicable to you.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   If you're in this manner, this manner, this manner,
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.100]   you should really ignore this advice."
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:22.100]   Unfortunately, whether it's just that doesn't work or what,
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.100]   but I almost never read an article that's written like that.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:32.100]   What I've experienced, you have to consume a whole bunch of information
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   until you start to actually be able to see through
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.100]   and articulate the certain things.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.100]   How much did it cost you to start your financial planning firm yourself?
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.100]   Any idea?
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   Yeah, I do have an idea because I know exactly how much it was to the dollar.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   I assume, but I was trying to give you some out in case you were behind
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.100]   on your bookkeeping like I get sometimes.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.100]   Nope, I stay up on my bookkeeping.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.100]   Sure you do.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:59.100]   I started off with an investment of $10,000.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.100]   My husband and I, a long time ago, fully funded our emergency savings fund.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   Then whenever I decided that I was going to start a business at some point,
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.100]   I started overfunding my emergency savings fund
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   so that I would have some money to go ahead and get started.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.100]   What was funny was with all of that, apparently I didn't think about,
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.100]   "I would like to have a cushion in my business bank account
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.100]   so that it doesn't go down to $0 every couple of months."
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   Whenever I started with everything, implementing my business plan,
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.100]   I found out pretty quickly that $10,000 wasn't too far off,
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.100]   but I really wanted $5,000 in my bank account at all times.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.100]   In the business bank account, not in my personal bank account.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.100]   I don't want to be sitting here transferring back and forth.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.100]   So I decided to make another $5,000 investment into the business.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.100]   So it's $15,000 total has been invested into the business.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.100]   The reason I'm asking this is, number one, one of the areas of transparency
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   that I don't think we as financial planners do a good enough job at
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.100]   is talking about how much it costs to actually run a firm.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.100]   Because the perception that many people have is,
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.100]   "Well, just why do you charge me so much money?
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.100]   Why don't you just see me for this?"
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.100]   You can go back through and say, "Well, let me tell you about the hours I spent studying.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   Let me tell you about the cost of the exams.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.100]   Let me tell you about all this."
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.100]   But even just straight up running a firm is not cheap.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:32.100]   That's why I don't do it right now is because the software fees, all those things.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:37.100]   If it were just no cost, and it was like, "Oh, I'll just keep my licenses around
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   and every now and then I'll work an hour here, work an hour there, and make a few hundred bucks."
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.100]   Well, anyone would do that, but it's not that way.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:50.100]   So how much would you guess as far as on a monthly basis to support your infrastructure, software, and all that?
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.100]   How much does it cost you to run a firm?
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:38:03.100]   I think it's between $600 to $700 to cover all of my membership to the Financial Planning Association,
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:10.100]   my insurance that I have to have to be an investment advisory representative,
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:17.100]   and then the technology that I need to be able to actually run the firm is between about $600 to $700.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.100]   But lately I've been kind of playing around with outsourcing stuff.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.100]   And so I kind of do that on a "How much do I have coming in?"
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.100]   And at this point, I try to reinvest that back into the business.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:35.100]   So if I have some extra money, I'll say, "Okay, well, then I'm going to take this other thing that's on my list
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:42.100]   of things that are not really all that important to my clients, but I would really like for it to continue to be done,
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.100]   and I'm going to try out using somebody else."
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:51.100]   And it's usually like marketing type of stuff or like operations, accounting, that type of stuff.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   The fun stuff.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.100]   The fun stuff. Yeah, exactly. I made a list of what is fun and what is not fun.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.100]   And I said, "All right, I'm going to take the stuff that is really not fun,
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   and hopefully I can outsource that to somebody else as soon as possible."
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.100]   What do you miss about being part of a larger firm?
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.100]   I do miss the camaraderie sometimes.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.100]   So I am part of a network called the XY Planning Network.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.100]   I think that's really good because I have a study group that I meet with on a regular basis.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.100]   I can kind of bounce questions off of people.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.100]   And those are all things that I used to have within a larger firm where it was a lot easier.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:31.100]   Like you walk down the hall and you ask the advisor who's been in business for 35 years,
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:36.100]   "Hey, I've run across this particular client issue. What do you think about it?"
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   Or, "I've run across this particular business issue. What do you think about it?"
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:45.100]   So now I kind of have to create that camaraderie and that peer network
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:50.100]   because I don't have a big firm.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:55.100]   At this point it's me and a couple of people that I'm outsourcing stuff to and an intern.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   Right.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:04.100]   Do you think that you could have started this firm directly out of college
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   without any experience in the industry?
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.100]   I think I would have thought that I could have.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   And I think I might have made it about this long.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   And then I would probably be grossly running out of money at this point
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.100]   and trying to figure it all out along the way.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:25.100]   So I was really glad that I had the experiences that I have had
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:30.100]   to be able to take that and be able to give that to my clients.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.100]   Because it's not just book knowledge.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.100]   It's being able to say, "I've worked with people in this exact situation
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.100]   and I know what we need to do."
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:46.100]   It's a challenging question because even in the course of the last 30 minutes
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.100]   we've joked about some of the problems of the financial planning industry.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.100]   But you can't be something with nothing.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:59.100]   You can't say, "Well, just because you have problems, it's easy to find fault."
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.100]   That's one of the biggest things I've learned over the last year
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.100]   about doing radical personal finance.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.100]   It's easy to find fault with other people.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.100]   It's easy to find fault with other financial broadcasters.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.100]   It's much more difficult to find fault and have a solution that works
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.100]   because there's a reason why a lot of the things exist.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:18.100]   The reason why, statistically, most people prefer to compensate a financial advisor
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.100]   through the commissions paid on the sale of a product.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.100]   That's what the research says.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.100]   They may or may not prefer. They don't know that they're paying it.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.100]   That's a good point. I'm with you.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.100]   But the studies indicate when people are asked, a majority--
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.100]   at least I can't cite the exact figure, but I have a memory of reading some of the studies--
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.100]   where it says, "Majorities say, 'I would rather just my advisor gets paid in this way.'"
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:46.100]   And so whether they should or not, that's something that you've got to talk about.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.100]   And so when you're going against it, that's where we've got to--
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.100]   if we're going to develop new models of financial planning,
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.100]   if you're going against that model, you've got to come up with something that's more compelling.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.100]   And so always the question that I have is,
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:08.100]   I do not believe--I couldn't have come in and started a financial planning firm without the experience.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:13.100]   And so I have no idea how to negotiate these challenges between learning in firms,
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.100]   where there are a lot of things that are great and some things that you wish you had changed,
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.100]   and then just saying, "Well, it's not fair. Those businesses will eventually fail,"
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   if people are just going in and using them to learn and then moving on their way.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:30.100]   So it's kind of the eternal question of, "Is it possible to start just on your own?"
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   Maybe somebody has been able to do it, but it's not an easy road.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:42.100]   I would say there's probably a lot more networks that support people that are starting their own firm
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.100]   than there used to be.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:48.100]   There didn't used to be places where you could say, "Okay, I want to start my own firm,
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.100]   but I really don't know how to do that.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:58.100]   And so maybe I'll actually pay somebody else to set up all the compliance documents for my firm."
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.100]   And I think that those are becoming more prevalent than they used to be.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:08.100]   It used to be that the only way to start your own business was either you affiliated with the strip mall advisor firm,
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.100]   or you went to an insurance company.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.100]   And that was kind of the two options that you had.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:20.100]   But then you were kind of stuck selling whatever products it was that they told you that you needed to sell.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   So I do think that it's becoming probably easier to start a firm.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.100]   But I mean, it goes back to the advice I give clients.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.100]   Just because you can doesn't mean that you should.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:37.100]   Just because you qualify for a $500,000 house does not mean that you should buy a $500,000 house.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:43.100]   Just because they will sell you a $40,000 vehicle does not mean that you should buy a $40,000 vehicle.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.100]   I think it's the exact same thing with financial planners.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:51.100]   Just because you can start a firm doesn't mean necessarily that you should start a firm.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:57.100]   You should have a really good, deep, introspective look at what are your strengths.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.100]   What do you have as far as support for your cash flow for your family?
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:07.100]   Are you going to have to be covering the bills for the firm and also covering the bills for you personally?
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:14.100]   Because that's harder than if you are somebody who's married and your spouse is covering the bills for the family.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.100]   And you're just having to cover the bills for the firm.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:23.100]   So I always encourage people to really take a good look at all of that stuff before they jump in.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.100]   Because otherwise, you don't want to...
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.100]   It's kind of like a race against time.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:36.100]   If you are trying to get into a race against time and you think, "Okay, I'm going to make it at one year.
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.100]   And I'm going to make exactly the same amount that I used to make at a firm,"
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.100]   you might be really sorely disappointed.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.100]   Because sometimes, just because you're really, really excited about it
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:50.100]   doesn't mean that all of your clients are immediately going to be as excited as you
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:56.100]   and bust out their credit card or debit card to pay you immediately.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:01.100]   Some of those people might be really great clients, but it might take them a good six months
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.100]   to decide that they actually want to move forward with this.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.100]   Finally, do you have any favorite tools that you love to recommend to clients
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.100]   to help with personal budgeting, personal tracking?
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.100]   What are some of the favorite tools that you love to recommend?
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.100]   I really like...
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:23.100]   Well, it's funny because some people do really, really well with financial spending apps.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.100]   And some people really hate them.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:33.100]   I don't know why, but I feel like the people that are probably more analytically oriented
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.100]   love financial apps.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.100]   How could anybody hate data?
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   They love financial apps.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.100]   What's wrong with those people?
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   I mean, they're like, "Woohoo!"
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.100]   And then there are some people who...
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.100]   It's like, if I ever set them up with a mint.com or something like that,
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.100]   they'd be like, "This is way too much information.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:53.100]   Can we put something in place where it's just like, 'This is the bottom line
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.100]   and that's what I'm tracking towards.'"
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.100]   Right.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.100]   So I do recommend some financial apps.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.100]   They're really, really helpful for getting organized.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.100]   And that's always the first step anyways.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.100]   If you're trying to look and say, "Okay, this is what I have left over every month,"
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.100]   or, "This is what I can actually commit to putting towards my goals,"
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.100]   it's really hard to do that if you don't know where the money is going right now.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   And you would be shocked how many people just have no idea where the money is going right now.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.100]   They're like, "I used to have a handle on it, and then I started making more,
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.100]   and then I think my expenses went up, and I'm not really sure,"
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.100]   because at this point, who knows?
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.100]   It just goes out the door.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:42.100]   But anything where it helps people to get organized I think is always really beneficial.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:48.100]   So anywhere where they can save documents to one central place
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.100]   or anything where they can connect accounts and have a dashboard
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:57.100]   and be able to see everything in one place is actually really helpful
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.100]   with that getting organized aspect.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.100]   Firm name, website, where do people go if they want to connect with you?
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.100]   My firm is Your Richest Life.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.100]   The website is yourrichestlifeplanning.com.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.100]   And then you can find me on Twitter.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.100]   I'm @KatyYrl.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.100]   Nice.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.100]   Katy, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   All right. Thanks for having me.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.100]   Hope you enjoyed that interview with Katy.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:31.100]   She's a wonderful lady, and I just really enjoy spending time with her.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.100]   And even as you're listening to this, I'm sure that I am,
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.100]   even though I've prerecorded this interview,
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   I'm sure that I'm going to be able to get a lot of things done with her.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.100]   And I'm sure that I am, even though I've prerecorded this intro and outro,
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.100]   I'm sure I'm spending time with her right now in Charlotte, North Carolina,
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.100]   her and dozens and dozens of other financial advisors
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.100]   who are all building continual practices.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.100]   I hope some of you will go and check out Katy's work.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.100]   Go and check out her website.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.100]   Maybe some of you might find her to be a good fit for you,
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.100]   your personality, and your goals with regard to your own financial planning needs.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:07.100]   I personally believe that all of us need a world-class financial advisor.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.100]   That financial advisor will look a little bit different depending on what stage you are.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:16.100]   But one of the things that I'm convinced of is you can avoid a lot of mistakes
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.100]   if you just get good advice.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.100]   If you look at people who are very wealthy,
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.100]   if they're wealthy and they stay wealthy, they're going to have a team of advisors.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.100]   And here's the question.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.100]   Did they assemble that team after they were wealthy,
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.100]   or did they assemble that team along the way?
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:34.100]   I can't prove one way or the other, but my guess is that if we were to do a survey,
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.100]   some of them assembled it after the fact.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.100]   But many of them assembled that team along the way,
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.100]   and that was what helped them to avoid many of the major mistakes.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.100]   For that reason, I think we all need a good financial advisor,
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.100]   a team of financial advisors, coaches.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.100]   Now, it's different at different stages.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.100]   If you're just out of college and just getting started,
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   you don't need a high-priced attorney.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.100]   You need very simple stuff.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.100]   But if you've got millions of dollars, you better get some good advice.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.100]   So go and check out Katy's work.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.100]   Also, as I mentioned--I think I mentioned on a recent show--
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.100]   when I return from the conferences this week,
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.100]   I will be launching a personal coaching program, a financial coaching program as well,
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.100]   myself personally, as a way for me to establish some new--
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:18.100]   I'm establishing some new things with regard to ongoing products and coaching products,
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.100]   and I need to test those with--establishing some coaching sessions.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.100]   So if you're interested in that, shoot me an email,
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.100]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com, for details.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.100]   To be clear, I am not going to be taking asset management,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.100]   any of those types of things like I would be as a financial advisor.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:35.100]   This is strictly a coaching program, but it will include a little bit of financial perspective.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.100]   So thank you all so much for listening.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.100]   If you benefit at all from the content of Radical Personal Finance,
