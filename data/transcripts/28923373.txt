[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.520]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.060]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.660]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.080]   as we encourage one another, learn together
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.940]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.140]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.140]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.260]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.440]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.580]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.780]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.440]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.340]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.380]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.880]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.040]   Well, listeners, I have a suggestion for your family,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.700]   actually for all our families this Christmas.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.780]   What if we intentionally spent time together
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.500]   doing the simplest things?
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.140]   What if we practice simple habits
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.240]   designed to draw us to one another
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760]   and to start meaningful conversations
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.960]   and to provoke us to deeper thinking
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.540]   and even to encourage us to true worship?
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.460]   What if in this season of busy,
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.740]   we celebrated Christmas by praying together,
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.300]   playing together, reading together,
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.020]   exploring together and serving together?
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.280]   This Advent season, the Everyday Educator
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.180]   wants to practice these habits along with you.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.700]   And we're gonna talk to others
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.820]   who want to try this plan too.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.820]   So you listen in every Tuesday to ponder the next habit.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.940]   Today, we're gonna be thinking about playing together
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.700]   and I have one of my favorite playmates,
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.900]   Kelly Wilt here with me to talk about Christmas
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500]   and simplifying Advent.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.820]   So Kelly, thanks for joining me.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.340]   - Absolutely, Lisa.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.660]   I am so excited to talk about this with you today.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.300]   I am sitting here in front of our own Christmas tree,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.880]   which we are hoping to decorate this week
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.980]   at the time of this podcast.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.700]   And Christmas is my favorite holiday for many reasons.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.380]   So I'm excited to talk about that today.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.360]   - I'm so excited.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.140]   We are getting our tree tonight
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.980]   and then decorating it tomorrow.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.220]   So you and I will be in joyful community
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.500]   when we get to do that.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.900]   Let me ask you, I know you said
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.100]   that you were a big Christmas lover.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.920]   What is it that you love about Christmas?
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.500]   - Well, I think some of the things
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   that I love about celebrating Christmas are,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.900]   well, the very first one that I can think of
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.700]   is that Christmas was always a time set apart in our family.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.020]   Our church would do specific fun activities,
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.300]   thoughtful activities around this time of year.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.740]   And so my little heart, even as a little person,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.500]   was always tuned in to that Christmas season
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.820]   and to the special things that only happened
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.740]   during that time of year.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.220]   And I loved all of the activities our church would plan.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.580]   It just made Christmas something special in my eyes,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.340]   even when I was young.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.380]   And so that combined with the fact
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.060]   that our family would get together
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.660]   and we would sing and we would feast.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.420]   I sound like, you know, I sound like Dr. Seuss.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.660]   We would feast on Christmas. - I'm not the feast,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.660]   feast, feast, yeah. (laughs)
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.740]   - And we would fellowship together and celebrate,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.620]   which, you know, to us as believers,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.740]   is the special holiday for this time of year,
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.660]   celebrating the birth of Christ.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.860]   - Yeah, so it sounds like Christmas was kind of a big deal
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.820]   in your home and your family when you were growing up.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.660]   - Yes, yes, I would say for certain,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.340]   that is a true statement. (laughs)
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.420]   - Yeah, I think, and my parents both loved Christmas too,
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.820]   'cause I can remember, kinda like you,
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.340]   that my family, there were certain things that we did.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.180]   I can actually remember going with my daddy
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.700]   and sometimes my little sister out to property
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.540]   that he owned out in the country and pulling running cedar
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.780]   and we made our own Christmas wreath for the front door.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.020]   And so, I mean, just little things like that,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.700]   he invested a lot, he and my mom invested a lot
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.900]   in creating Christmas rituals and traditions
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.900]   that we kept up with and that was really special to me too.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.380]   So tell me one of your most vivid Christmas memories
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.140]   with your family and it can be silly or serious
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.300]   or embarrassing, we're all friends here.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.820]   (laughs)
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.900]   - Or a little bit of all of that, right?
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.260]   Oh my, I think one, when I think about Christmas,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.620]   particularly when I was young,
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.460]   one of the things that immediately comes to mind
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.780]   is the fact that every Christmas Eve,
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.500]   my mother's side of our family would get together
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.860]   and we would have a Christmas Eve party for family
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.460]   who lived close by, but just life happened
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.220]   and we never really got together on a regular basis.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.260]   And everyone would bring food and we would sit around
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.540]   and we would talk and the grandchildren in the family
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.180]   would play games and it reminds me a lot of what I read
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.820]   in Charles Dickens where all the adults sit together
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.020]   and talk in fellowship and the kids play games.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.700]   It was just so memorable and I remember,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.820]   even as I sit here thinking about that,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.820]   distinct smells and tastes and sounds come to mind.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.460]   I had one aunt that always brought the same pea salad.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.900]   - Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.020]   - I remember looking at that when I was five, six,
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.260]   seven years old and going, oh, what is that?
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.220]   Well, by the time that I got to be 12, 13, 14,
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.980]   that pea salad tasted pretty good.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.860]   - Isn't that hilarious, oh.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.820]   - Remember, it was a special time for me to see people
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.620]   who now have gone on to be with the Lord,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.220]   but at that time, when I reflect on that,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.260]   it was such a special time for us as a family
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.340]   to be together and to celebrate the birth of Christ
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.140]   and to celebrate our relationships with each other.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.180]   And that just was so special.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.460]   - Yeah, it's so funny, the things that kids remember
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.380]   always surprise their parents.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.460]   'Cause I know there are things that I remembered
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.700]   and they made such an impression on me
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.500]   and I would mention it to my mom and dad
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.980]   and they were like, yeah, that never happened.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.820]   (laughing)
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.020]   And I'm like, it did, or they have no memory of it.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.300]   But what I've discovered is that some of the things
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.020]   that are most memorable to me and the ones
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.900]   that my parents remember too come from,
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.140]   it became kind of like a shared joke.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.340]   I know that when my sister and I were little,
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.780]   we loved Christmas Eve.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.460]   We loved going to church on Christmas Eve,
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.740]   but we loved the special time that we had at home
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.340]   just with our family because we opened gifts
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.260]   from one another on Christmas Eve.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.780]   And so we looked forward to that.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.780]   And some of the best excitement came from seeing
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.660]   what somebody else thought about the gift you gave them.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.420]   So it wasn't all just that we couldn't wait to get new stuff.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.480]   But I can remember every year we would get ready,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.260]   we would parcel the presents out and my dad would say,
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.620]   well, before we open presents,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.140]   I really think we need to go look at the Christmas lights.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.100]   And he would do it every year.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.740]   And it became a moan and groan time.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.340]   So we usually opened gifts,
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.840]   but then we would put on our pajamas
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.960]   and we would go look at the Christmas lights.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.760]   And so that becomes one of my most treasured
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.040]   childhood memories, both because of the moan and groan
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.380]   that was the shared joke every year.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.500]   But also it was a time when we were just in the car,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.460]   just the four of us, it was dark, it was quiet.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.740]   We were looking at things that were beautiful
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.120]   in our community and it drew us together.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.620]   So a lot of times I think what makes those memories
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.620]   so vivid to us is their shared nature.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.660]   And then what you talked about,
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.460]   you know, that there are smells and sounds.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.940]   So it's very sensory.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.380]   Those kinds of memories are vivid
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.840]   because they're so sensory.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.940]   So think about your family today.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.420]   I know that you and Kim have three lovely children.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.980]   So what are the hallmarks of your Christmas
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.240]   celebrating in your family today?
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.480]   And what are the things that your kids look forward to?
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.580]   - Oh, well, let me preface this by saying
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.880]   that we as a family are in a time of transition
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.860]   right now at the time of this podcast.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.860]   So our eldest is graduating from college this year.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.480]   And so Christmas is going to be looking a little different
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.340]   for us as a family, you know,
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.100]   moving forward into the future, our middle son
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.820]   is graduating from high school
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.060]   and heading off into the future.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.380]   And so as of next Christmas,
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.380]   we will only have one child who is still at home.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.060]   And so that is a change for this mama
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.520]   because I can remember, you know, when they were little,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   I had certain things that I planned on certain days
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.080]   and we would do them together.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.380]   And so now Christmas takes a little more effort on my part
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.180]   because I need to reach out to my children
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.720]   who are no longer under our roof
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.380]   and still involve them in the celebration
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.540]   and in participating, even at a distance,
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.100]   what we're doing together as a family.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.520]   So it will look a little different for us this year,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.980]   but that's not a bad thing.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.720]   It's just going to take some growing and stretching
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.260]   as our children move from under our roof out into the world.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.120]   - Yes, yes.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.580]   So things can look different and I, you know,
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.420]   I'm here to say, it's true, it does change.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.040]   No matter how much you love all the things
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.200]   that you've always done,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.440]   no matter how much of a traditionalist you are like I am,
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.680]   and one, especially of my daughters as well,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.160]   we did it this way one time.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.980]   So that has set a precedent and we must do it that way
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.300]   until Jesus comes back.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.800]   As hard as we want to hold to all the things
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.300]   that we always loved, you do have to flex a little bit.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.980]   But you know what, Kelly, I'll tell you,
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.580]   from the perspective of a mama
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.820]   with two grown married daughters
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.900]   who have their own families that they do celebrations with,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.620]   there are things that your kids will continue
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.660]   to want to do with you.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.300]   They're family traditions that will endure.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.340]   - Yes, yes.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.740]   It's funny that you say that because our eldest,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.300]   who is away and will be coming home
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.160]   for Christmas break soon, has already messaged me
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.620]   with the Christmas cookies
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.420]   that he specifically wants to go home and bake with me.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.380]   And so I know that there are, in their minds,
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.900]   those traditions are a tapestry
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.040]   that we have woven over time as a family.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.540]   And each year they want to see that tapestry rolled out
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.260]   so they can find all of those threads
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.640]   that we had so carefully placed over the years before.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.340]   And so his threads, I think,
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.440]   primarily involve things he can eat.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.900]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.980]   - Which is pretty typical, I think, for his age.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.260]   But it gives me joy to begin preparing for that
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260]   because I know it is so meaningful,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.980]   not only for me, but also for him.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.900]   - Yeah, oh, it's so true.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.620]   And there are traditions that you,
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.340]   I alluded to it a minute ago,
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.940]   there are traditions that you start intentionally
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.060]   with your family. - Yes.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.580]   - And then there are things that become tradition
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.880]   and you have no idea that this was gonna catch hold.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.600]   And there are certain meals that I ask the girls,
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.640]   so you're coming home, so what is it that you,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.120]   if you're coming for Christmas Eve, what do you want?
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.400]   You're coming, okay, so I can ask that.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.320]   But if I ask them, what do you want for breakfast
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.500]   on Christmas morning or supper on Christmas night,
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.340]   they look at me like I have two heads.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.100]   And they're like, well, I mean what we always have,
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.320]   why would you change that?
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.680]   And so one year, one year, I made chicken and dumplings
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.420]   for supper Christmas night.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.020]   And I mostly think it's 'cause it was cold
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.720]   and we didn't need a super heavy meal.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.960]   But that became the tradition.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.080]   And now, I mean, if you come to my house on Christmas night,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.380]   you're welcome, but we'll be having chicken and dumplings.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.220]   (laughing)
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.300]   And so that's just gonna, so I'd like to know
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.540]   what is one tradition that you started intentionally
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.820]   with your family and then what is one that began
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.340]   unintentionally but continues?
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.060]   - Oh, okay, so my intentional tradition
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.680]   that Ken and I both decided to do with our children
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.620]   involves decorating the tree.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.620]   So we always, our tree is very full, very, very full.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.220]   And so we put on all of the, what my husband calls
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.520]   the fluffy ornaments, the things that really don't have
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.080]   significance but are beautiful to look at.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.780]   And the very last thing that we do when we decorate the tree
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.880]   is each year as a family, we lay out our ornaments
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.060]   that are associated with each year
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.340]   that our family has celebrated together.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.660]   And so we put them, we lay them out on the floor
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.300]   almost like a timeline of our family.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   And as we are putting one ornament at a time up on the tree,
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.460]   we actually are telling the story of our family.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.440]   And it brings me to tears almost every single year
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.260]   because we are decorating the tree and making it beautiful,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.420]   but we are reflecting on the goodness of God
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.040]   in the life of our family.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.200]   And so that either began very intentionally
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.100]   and I will say, our children still say,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.400]   not the year ornaments, not the year ornaments,
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.980]   I want to put up 2004 or let me put up 2007.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.580]   And it just is a wonderful time of intentional reflection
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.980]   on the goodness of God in our family.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.340]   - I remember when my girls got married
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.800]   and their husbands helped us decorate the tree.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.060]   One of the boys, I mean, we had been at this for a while
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.580]   and he looked up and he said to his wife,
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.100]   "Man, it takes your family a long time
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.940]   to decorate the tree."
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.300]   And she looked at him like, "I mean, you have married
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.220]   into the wrong clan if this bothers you."
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.160]   And I said, "Yes, honey, it takes a long time
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.180]   because we tell the stories every year.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.180]   It is the story of our family's life together in the Lord
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.900]   and in the midst of what he brought to our life
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.900]   through the years."
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.220]   And so, yeah, I completely understand that.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.380]   Okay, so what is your unintentional attention?
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.060]   - So this is a funny story.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.220]   So when our children were little,
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.220]   we were really concerned about our porcelain nativity
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.300]   because they just wanted to hold baby Jesus.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.200]   They wanted to hold Mary and Joseph
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.380]   and their little pudgy fists.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.100]   And I just had visions of them being dashed on the floor.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.280]   And then I wanted to preserve that beautiful set.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.060]   So we went out to the store and we bought a Fisher Price
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.700]   little people nativity set so they could hold the baby.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.000]   They could put him in the manger.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.860]   They could play the song and the star would light up.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:38.060]   And the funny thing about that is we always put it
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.620]   on our kitchen table because that was where we did school.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.060]   - Right, you did your devotions and there it is.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.740]   - Yes, so they could pick the pieces up.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.660]   As we read through the Bible, through the Christmas story,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.280]   during the month of December, they could hold those pieces
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.660]   and it made it very real and tangible
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.580]   for them as little people.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.860]   Well, we got maybe three or four years
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.460]   after we started doing this together, just very casually.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.300]   One day I got to the part of the story about the wise men.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.940]   And it was the first time I think any of my children
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.780]   had connected the fact that the wise men
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.620]   were not standing there when baby Jesus was born.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.340]   - They do not belong in the stable, yes.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.500]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.280]   It wasn't like baby Jesus was born and he was swaddled
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.340]   and there were the gold frankincense and myrrh.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.900]   And they were horrified that that little people,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.940]   nativity set had the wise men.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.540]   - Right, but that is not accurate.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.300]   - So our eldest took them and our nativity was,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.580]   our manger was sitting on the table and he took the wise men
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.100]   and he put them on the bookshelf in the hallway.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.300]   And he said, "They're not there yet,
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.620]   "but they're gonna get there."
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.840]   And I watched in amusement over the next few days
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.540]   as the wise men would show up a little closer
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.180]   and a little closer and a little closer
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.580]   to our nativity sitting on the table.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.180]   So I know a lot of people have Elf on the Shelf
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.940]   and we had, and we still do have wise men in the kitchen.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.980]   - That is so perfect, I love that, I love that.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.100]   I always struggle 'cause I don't really want
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.800]   to put the wise men with the manger and with the stable,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.760]   but it's like, okay, but it belongs to the set,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.260]   where am I gonna put it?
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.220]   So that is awesome, that is awesome.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:28.180]   So I can tell, I mean, you have lots of traditions already
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.300]   that you've told us about that really helped you
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.120]   and Ken keep the deeper meaning of Christmas
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.320]   at the forefront, you know, the nativity
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.280]   and talking over the providence of God
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.780]   through all of the years.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.300]   Are there other things that you guys did intentionally,
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.620]   especially when your kids were young,
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.180]   to keep the deep meaning of Christmas
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.020]   at the forefront of your celebrations?
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.540]   - Wow, well, you know, I think it goes without saying
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.660]   that we would always make an effort
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.480]   to read the Christmas story to our children
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.000]   and we would not only read it, but we would talk about it.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.900]   We would talk about what do you think Mary felt?
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.240]   How would you feel?
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.680]   You know, what do you think,
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.340]   why do you think the wise men brought these gifts?
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.420]   We would ask questions to our children.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.180]   And so, you know, it made them really carefully ponder
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.500]   not only the words that you see in scripture,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.420]   but the humanity surrounding that moment.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.380]   We also, as a family, love to sing together.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.300]   And so we would sing, and we still do,
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.580]   sing Christmas carols together.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.220]   We play Christmas music constantly
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.540]   in the house on the Alexa.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.100]   You know, I think our poor Alexa is probably already tired
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.740]   of playing Christmas music at this point in the year.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.980]   - She'll get over it, she'll get over it.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.780]   - Even now, you know, when the kids come downstairs,
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.060]   you know, from their rooms in the morning,
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.480]   you know, they will begin playing music
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.040]   and they're in a constant state of Christmas.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.460]   And you know, when they were young,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.460]   we really tried to set the season apart,
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.120]   not as a season of commercialism,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.060]   but as a season of reflection on the goodness of God.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.660]   And so, you know, we would collect items
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.460]   for Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes,
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.860]   and we would take those to church.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.980]   And, you know, we've tried to look for, as a family,
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.300]   opportunities to serve others in this season.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   So it became a season of just quiet reflection for them
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.140]   in a world that can be very preoccupied with busy,
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.060]   you know, during this time.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.260]   And that's not to say that we didn't do lots
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.380]   of fun things too, you know, but we, you know,
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.380]   in the midst of all of, you know, the hustle and bustle
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.140]   and shopping and wrapping gifts and going here and there,
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.020]   we wanted them to be able to reflect
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.340]   on what is truly the heart of Christmas,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.140]   and that is Christ coming to this world as a baby.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.280]   And so that was always something
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.140]   that we really tried hard to prioritize with them,
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.500]   particularly when they were young and shaping their ideas
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.100]   of what Christmas is and what it should be.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.060]   - Right, and what is important to your family?
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.060]   What will you spend the most time talking about?
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.620]   And it does, you're exactly right, Kelly.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.180]   It really shapes the way they see the holiday
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:38.180]   and the way they experience the holiday as they grow up.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.300]   And I can see now, you know,
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.160]   my girls shaping their own families around that reflection
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.520]   on the goodness of God and the gift of baby Jesus.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.800]   And you're right, there are lots of ways
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   to still make it a delightful, fun celebration
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.380]   that your kids can understand
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.340]   and they can take delight and joy in.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.100]   'Cause I know you and I are on the same page
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.020]   when it comes to playing.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.900]   We are in favor of it.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.600]   I mean, I think that probably when our team gets together,
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.060]   we are among the most playful people.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:18.860]   I really, I honestly think that play
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.340]   is the work of childhood.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.180]   I actually think Einstein might have said that,
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.500]   but I actually think we teach our children so much
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.060]   through engaging their playful natures.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.480]   And so as we talk about ways that families
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.480]   can simplify advent by playing together,
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.840]   I want us to focus a little bit specifically on play.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.400]   So let me ask you, I wanna pick your brain.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.200]   How do you think play helps children learn?
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.400]   - Oh, I remember reading a quote
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.480]   that play is the work of childhood.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.400]   And I think that is so true because when you're young,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.760]   and you're imagining and you're laughing
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.520]   and you're just entertaining the idea
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.360]   of what imagination allows you to believe
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.500]   and to experience.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.300]   There is a deeper work that has begun at that point
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.820]   in the mind and the heart of a child.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.420]   Because I look at all three of my children now
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.840]   and they are rife with imagination.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.080]   And I think it's because when they were younger,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.280]   I would pretend with them.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   And as an adult, I made it acceptable for us to play.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.340]   And Lisa, in the years before we began our family,
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.600]   I was a classroom teacher.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   And so I worked with little people even then.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.880]   And so in my mind, I thought, how can we use play
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.540]   to help us to learn?
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.640]   So, even thinking about that in the Christmas season,
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.440]   one of the things that I did for my children
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.720]   when they were little was I would make play dough,
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.560]   homemade play dough for them.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.320]   And at Christmas time, I had to give them warnings
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.220]   because I didn't want it to end up in their mouth.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.180]   That would be a not tasty surprise.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.860]   - Not a good surprise.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.480]   - But I would put cinnamon and ginger
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.000]   and all of these spices that would make that play dough
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.300]   seem like gingerbread dough.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.640]   And they would roll it out and they would smell their hands
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.960]   and they would make gingerbread men using my cookie cutters,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.660]   even when they were little and put beads on them for eyes.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.820]   And we would read the story of the gingerbread man.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.160]   And there were so many wonderful things
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.880]   that we did when they were little
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.520]   that I still have conversations with them about now.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.360]   And our youngest has said, "Oh, when I have a family,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.860]   "I'm going to fill in the blank here."
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.160]   And so, playing with our children
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   not only increases their scope for imagination,
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.780]   but it also gives them the foundation
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.360]   for what they may want to do in the future
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.280]   with their own families.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.440]   And I think that's a pretty great thing.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.040]   - Oh, I do too.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.200]   I think a lot of times play will really help kids
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.240]   engage their emotions.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.800]   I think imagination is so great
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.960]   and stories for the same reason,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.720]   because they help our children experience things
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.120]   that they're not experiencing in real life.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.580]   And so I know one of my daughters says,
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.560]   "Oh, I've lived a thousand lives through the books
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.140]   "I've read and through the history sentences
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.240]   "I have played in the backyard woods.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.400]   "I have lived a thousand different lives."
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.440]   She'll say, "I've been an orphan, I've been a pirate queen,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.200]   "I've been a pilgrim, I've been an Indian princess."
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.120]   She's been all of these things.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.200]   She's lived all of these lives and it helps them to feel.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.900]   We used to act out the Christmas story.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.420]   But one of the years, one year,
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.840]   this was just so traumatic for me as a young mom,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.680]   but my kids thought it was wonderful.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.800]   We lived in this drafty old parsonage
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.360]   and one Christmas Eve, it was the coldest
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.360]   I ever remember it being and the power went out.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.300]   And so we had nothing but one fireplace in the living room.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.200]   And when the power went out, I had my sweet little girls,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.380]   two and four years old in the bathtub with wet hair
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.560]   and I'm freaking out.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.500]   And so we bundled them up and brought them to the fire
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.060]   and we made it such a fun thing.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.020]   So we spread a big picnic cloth blanket out.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.740]   And like you said, we made lots of things out of Play-Doh
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.400]   and then they really needed to get up and move around
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.660]   and they were like, "Well, we'll just act out
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.560]   "the Christmas story."
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.180]   So they went and they found props.
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.400]   And you know, Daddy had to be the shepherd and Joseph
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.320]   and the white man and then we all took turns being animals.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.920]   We acted it out 40 different ways.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.720]   Everybody got to be a character.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.660]   And we talked about what did those characters feel or think
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.500]   or what did they see?
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.600]   And we would get down hands and knees and say,
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.840]   "What do you think the donkey can see?
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.620]   "And what do you think the donkey thought?"
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.860]   And so that imagination, that is great.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.060]   It helped my kids when they were preschoolers
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.220]   think about the Christmas story as something real
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.380]   that real people experienced.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.820]   But we asked them to imagine
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.560]   what those feelings could have been.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.900]   And that was really cool.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.900]   That was a good thing.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.220]   - Yes, I'm sitting here thinking about
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.340]   when all three of ours were young,
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.660]   one of the ways that we engaged their imagination
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.060]   was that we had supplies at the ready
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.900]   for them to wrap up things in their rooms
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.820]   or to put them in gift bags with tissue paper
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.980]   and then to present each other with presents
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.220]   from their rooms.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.860]   And I still remember our youngest,
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.380]   she was maybe, oh, maybe four or five years old,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.340]   just old enough to really begin to understand
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.540]   the giving of gifts at Christmas time.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.060]   And I remember she had this Christmas bag
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.100]   that was, oh, it was so raggedy-taggedy
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.100]   because she loved it so much.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.940]   And she would bring me, throughout the day,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.200]   random items from her room in this Christmas bag.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.340]   And so I would always make sure to open it
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.220]   as if I was surprised and then pull out the tissue paper
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.420]   and go, oh, it's just what I wanted.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.180]   And she would cackle.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.940]   And then I would find some humorous way
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.300]   to use whatever she had brought me.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.260]   If it was a baby doll bottle,
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.180]   I would pretend to drink out of it.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.840]   Or if it was a blanket,
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.240]   I would wrap it around my shoulders like a shawl
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.180]   and we would dance around together.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:15.180]   And it made her, it delighted her to give.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.900]   And I think, just like you were saying,
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.380]   I think that is a wonderful thing.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.220]   She was playing a giving.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.980]   Now, as a teenager, she comes to me and says,
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.380]   "Wow, Mom, you know what?
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.020]   I think this person needs this.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.180]   And I think I'm gonna see if I can give that to them."
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.500]   And it created this spirit of generosity in her
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.260]   as a little person that, probably at that moment,
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.500]   we were just having fun and celebrating together.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.540]   But it brought about beautiful consequences for her
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.580]   as a teen that will hopefully carry on with her
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.520]   into the future.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.980]   So I agree with you.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   Imagination is a powerful tool to help shape our children
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.020]   into the people that they are going to be.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.300]   And we have to harness that as parents
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.100]   and use it wisely to shape them into people
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:15.020]   who are seeking what is good and true and beautiful.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.920]   - I love that.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.840]   I love that, Kelly.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   And it happens in ways that you don't realize
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.500]   are becoming so ingrained.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.580]   I know that one of the things that we did with our family,
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.740]   my husband likes to work with wood.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.100]   And so he made a little manger and we would get some hay
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.000]   and we would put it in there.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.080]   And the manger was out on a low table
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.220]   where the girls could see it all through December,
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.560]   the empty manger.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.580]   And we would, every day, every morning,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.460]   when they were really little, they would get up.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.200]   Even when Stephanie was young,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.620]   I would get her out of the crib
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.420]   and we would go and look at the manger.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.260]   No, baby, Jesus is not there.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.340]   It's not Christmas morning yet.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.860]   And so it became a thing where they always, as they grew,
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.960]   they would pass by and see the manger well
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.440]   on Christmas morning when Stephanie woke up,
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.840]   when she was a little tiny child.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.520]   The habit was go to check and lo and behold,
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.000]   baby Jesus was there.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.880]   We had talked so much about Christmas is about Jesus
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.200]   and we focus on Jesus and we're always thinking,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.160]   so when we go to get the tree,
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.800]   what kind of trees might Jesus have sent?
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.400]   We were always talking about Jesus.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   And so she was like, "Oh, baby Jesus has come!"
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.180]   And so she grabbed him.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.180]   She said, "Come on, baby Jesus, let's go see the presents."
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.380]   And so she was little.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.300]   So she grabbed baby Jesus.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.220]   She was almost two the first year that we did that,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.820]   but she was a precocious talkative, too.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.340]   And so she grabbed baby Jesus
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.140]   and she would unwrap a present
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.360]   and she would hold baby Jesus up,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.620]   "Look, baby Jesus, see it, see it?"
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.320]   And then she would tuck it back under her arm.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.360]   And so Kelly, I hope, I don't know,
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.060]   I guess they would be okay
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.920]   if I had told this out to the world at large.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.260]   That manger, the very same manger
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.760]   is still part of our Christmas decorations.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.000]   And my kids still, although they have their own homes,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   they spend Christmas Eve night with us.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.720]   And when they come up, the manger on Christmas Eve
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.000]   is moved to downstairs where their bedrooms are.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And when they come upstairs to see the tree
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.480]   on Christmas morning, they have baby Jesus in their arms.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.760]   Still.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.600]   - I love it.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.780]   - And so I'm like, okay,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.600]   that was an unintentional random thing
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.120]   that this little young mama did,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.960]   not thinking it was gonna be a tradition.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.880]   But it is such a tradition that Jesus has stayed the focus
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.220]   of Christmas for them.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.880]   And I'm super glad about that.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.080]   All right, let's brainstorm.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.220]   'Cause I know you have a very fertile imagination, friend.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.160]   And some of our listeners might be thinking,
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.660]   y'all had a lot of fun in your family,
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.640]   but I'm not sure that I can play like that with my kids.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   Let's brainstorm some ways to play as a family this season.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.960]   Give me an idea.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.720]   - I think the first thing I will say
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.480]   before I generate any ideas
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.000]   is please don't be afraid to get messy.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.320]   Because play is not always organized and clean.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.580]   Sometimes it is messy.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.680]   So I would say if you have younger children,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.000]   one of the things that my kids loved,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.860]   we would squirt some shaving cream on the countertop
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.280]   and they would draw with their little fingers.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.880]   And I would say, draw a Christmas tree.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.780]   Draw, and they would draw those out
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.800]   and then we would clean off the countertop.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.720]   Or if you're a little less inclined to mess,
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.840]   you can always put hair gel or something like that
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.360]   into a Ziploc bag and tape it shut.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.520]   And then they can draw on top of that.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.280]   I think also for little people,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.200]   like what I was saying before,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.800]   making Play-Doh is so simple.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.620]   It only takes a few ingredients,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.000]   but when you mix in spices
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.680]   that just remind you of the Christmas season,
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.320]   it makes it come alive for your children.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.000]   Just make sure to warn them not to put it in their mouths
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.160]   because typically that kind of Play-Doh has a lot of salt.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.680]   And so it will not be as pleasant to taste
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.840]   as it is to smell.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.520]   I would also say for students who are children
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.440]   who are a little older,
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   just because you haven't done something in the past,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.880]   don't be afraid to start a new tradition with them
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.920]   at any moment.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.400]   Like you were saying, chicken and dumplings
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.380]   was something that happened out of necessity
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.680]   because it was cold
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.560]   and probably because you had chicken in your fridge,
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.440]   but it became a tradition.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.920]   Put your children in the car
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.320]   and take a thermos with some hot chocolate in it
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   and just go look at Christmas lights together as a family.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.880]   Play Christmas music on the radio.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   If your church has services that you can attend together,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.240]   do that.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.920]   Even doing something as simple as standing outside
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.960]   with candles or even for the littlest people,
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.760]   battery operated tea lights
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.680]   so they don't catch anything on fire
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.200]   and singing "Joy to the World, Our Silent Night"
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.920]   is simple but meaningful to your family
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.800]   as long as you're doing it together.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.480]   I think that's the key, Lisa, really.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.280]   The memories that my children have around this season
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.600]   regarding play were special,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.300]   not just because of what we were doing,
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.280]   but because of who we were doing it with.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.800]   - Oh, so much.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.080]   - And I mean, that just to me,
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   the togetherness and the communal delight
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.960]   of doing those things as a family
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.480]   makes them the memories that will last.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.680]   And so it does not take a lot of time or energy
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.760]   to get a shoebox and put a blanket in it and a baby doll
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.440]   and to do the exact same thing that you did
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.760]   with your girls when they were young.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.560]   Just being intentional to think about the Christmas story
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.520]   through the eyes of a child, what would they imagine?
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.920]   What would they want to pretend?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.800]   I mean, I can remember both of my boys
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.120]   pretending to be wise men.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.840]   They would wrap blankets around themselves.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.440]   And I think I'm trying to remember now what it was.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.180]   There was a shoebox that I think they wrapped
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.080]   in aluminum foil and that became the gold
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.520]   and a perfume bottle from my vanity tray
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.640]   became the frankincense and then also the myrrh
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.880]   and they would travel together to bring those things.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   And just giving your children permission to wonder
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:05.480]   I think is also a Christmas gift that we can give to them
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.240]   that will continue to be given year after year after year
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.520]   as they take those traditions
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.320]   and they pass them on to their children.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.000]   And I think as parents, one of the best gifts
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.280]   that we can give our children is to allow them
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.960]   to use their imagination to wonder.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.280]   Because even as an adult, I still read the Christmas story
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.600]   and I wonder about so many things.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.000]   How could God send his only son to earth as a baby?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.840]   How could Mary, now that I'm a mother,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.120]   how could Mary endure that trek
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.640]   knowing that she was pregnant? - Oh my word, yes.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.240]   - There are so many things that in my mind I wonder
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.480]   and I imagine.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.760]   And play as an adult to me now doesn't look quite the same
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.640]   as it did when I was little, but that spirit of wonder,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.680]   of wondering about why and how still continues on.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.920]   And hopefully that gift I've been able to pass on
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.560]   to my children and hopefully, like you,
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.480]   to my grandchildren in the future as well.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.840]   - Yeah, I love, you know what, the best thing to me
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.840]   about what you said was a great encouragement
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.240]   that playing together with our children,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.600]   it doesn't depend on you thinking up some grand,
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   new, flashy plan or something utterly outrageous.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.440]   It can be something that your children play
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.720]   or that you've played with them a hundred times
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.720]   like dollhouse, but you are intentionally doing it together
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:55.240]   and that is what makes it special.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   That is how you can simplify your Advent celebration
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.320]   this year, families, is by doing life together.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.040]   Play together.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   Some of you probably recognize those verbs of pray together,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.240]   play together, read together, explore together,
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.480]   and serve together as the backbone
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.200]   of what we encourage young families to do in Scribblers.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.240]   And so I just wanna say, I wanna be transparent,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.920]   those ideas come from our new resource,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.760]   Scribblers at Home, Recipes from Lifelong Learners.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.560]   And right now, if you are looking for a Christmas gift
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.480]   for a family that you know and love,
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   a copy of Scribblers at Home might be just the ticket.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   It is full of lots of fun, intentional play
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.080]   that families can do together.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.440]   It's easy to follow those step-by-step activities
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.880]   and you've got something for everybody.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.400]   The art lover, the history lover, the math person,
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.320]   the science explorer, everything is in there
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.880]   that you would need to play with your family.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.240]   So make a family's Christmas unforgettable
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.800]   this year with Scribblers.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.360]   And if you want to learn more about that resource,
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   visit classicalconversations.com/scribblers.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:28.720]   It is really true that the best gifts
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.200]   that we give our family involve time spent together.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.160]   So this Advent season, you guys,
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.760]   be encouraged to simplify, cut out some of the busy
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.280]   and substitute some togetherness.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.160]   Kelly, thank you so much for helping me think about
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.360]   how we can play together with our families
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.440]   and why that is so desirable.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.440]   - Absolutely.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.840]   Well, and I would just say to parents,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.840]   the key is not just to play, but to do it together.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.760]   Because in years to come,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.720]   your children may forget the activity,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.320]   but they will certainly not forget who they did it with.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.920]   - Oh, that's so perfect.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.640]   Thank you, that is the perfect spot to say Merry Christmas
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.320]   and goodbye.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.200]   And listeners, I'll see you next Tuesday
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.560]   and we will talk about another one of our ways
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.800]   to simplify Advent.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.600]   See you next time.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.200]   (gentle music)
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.260]   you
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:42.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
