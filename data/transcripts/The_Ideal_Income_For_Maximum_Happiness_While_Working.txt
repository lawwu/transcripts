[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about the ideal income to earn while working and
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.260]   In retirement the ideal income provides for a wonderful middle-class lifestyle
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.040]   That means owning your house having a car being able to afford raising two children
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.560]   Paying for college and taking I don't know three to four weeks of vacation a year
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.940]   That's a pretty good middle-class lifestyle. And I think that's what most of us want now
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.560]   Instead of debating whether president Biden's student loan forgiveness program will add to inflation
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.480]   Probably cause moral hazard
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.160]   Probably a little bit result in colleges raising tuition
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.300]   Probably a little bit and affect the outcome of the upcoming election
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.200]   Probably I decided to take a different tact
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.480]   I explored why the announced income threshold to receive student loan forgiveness is
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.440]   the ideal income for most people from this exploration I then
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.560]   Interpolated the ideal net worth for someone to have before retiring
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.040]   Listen folks someone didn't just randomly come up with a hundred twenty five thousand income threshold per person
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.960]   Figured to be eligible to receive loan forgiveness
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.480]   Instead a whole committee of well-paid
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.900]   highly educated people debated for over a year and decided a threshold of
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.260]   $50,000 above the median household income was the right call
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.920]   $50,000 folks the median household income is only about
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.440]   $75,000 so a hundred twenty five thousand dollars per person or
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:52.360]   $250,000 per married couple or filing head of household is quite a significantly higher amount than the median household income
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   Therefore the income threshold is not just a number but a clear guide for how much you should aim to make
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.000]   To live a more comfortable life
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.080]   And if you're burned out and making way more than a hundred twenty five thousand per person
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340]   Then you may consider taking things down a notch or two until November 5th
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.480]   2024 the next presidential election now first, let's just recap on August 24th
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.880]   2022 president Biden unveiled a plan to cancel up to ten thousand tax-free and federal student loans for borrowers who
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.520]   individually earn less than a hundred twenty five thousand and
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.880]   cancel up to
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   20,000 tax-free in federal student loans
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.640]   If you were a Pell Grant recipient and Pell Grant recipients are lower income households in addition
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   You can even get a refund for any payment
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.440]   including auto debit payments you made during the payment pause period that began on March 13
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.160]   2020 and
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   Finally president Biden will also extend a pause on federal student loan payments what he called quote the final time
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.640]   until December 31st
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.600]   2022 for background I went to William & Mary
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.320]   It's a state school and I paid in-state tuition because that's what we could comfortably afford
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   At the time tuition at William & Mary was twenty eight hundred dollars a year
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.440]   Versus about twenty two thousand a year for a comparable private university
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   I really wanted to go to Babson College this college about an hour west of Boston
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.880]   Because it was the number one college for entrepreneurship for like literally 20 years in a row now
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.560]   But it was just too expensive. So we decided nah, let's just skip that
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.160]   Let's go to our local state school and worst case if I graduated from William & Mary and couldn't find a thirty thousand dollar or
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.380]   Forty thousand dollar a year job. I could go back to my job making four dollars an hour and McDonald's and pay my parents back
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.000]   So luckily I got a better paying job not huge forty thousand dollars a year base salary at Goldman Sachs in New York City
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.480]   But it was enough to launch me into making more money in my career
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.940]   So whether you believe forgiving student loans for individuals making up to 125,000 is right or wrong
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   we must accept the government has the power to do what it wants and we the people voted these people in and
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.840]   Society is all about giving and taking you might have gotten I don't know child tax credit or a stimulus check
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.640]   Both of which I did not get or you could have got a PPP loan, right?
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.520]   A lot of people have been able to get PPP loans, but these loans are for running your business to pay your employees
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   So that's a little bit different
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.560]   But the point is, you know give and take that's what society is when you're lucky enough
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.640]   You give and when you're unlucky enough, hopefully you can take and get a helping hand
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.080]   So it is my belief the government believes
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   $125,000 per person is
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   the upper limit for what they describe as middle class and
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.100]   Middle class is the best class because it is the protected class that gains the most favor from the government
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   Further the middle class makes enough to live a comfortable lifestyle without the need for subsidies
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.160]   You know
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.840]   We're talking about again making enough to own a house a car have two kids and safer education and vacations
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.640]   At the same time the middle class is always eligible for subsidies such as the student loan forgiveness
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.380]   stimulus checks and child tax credits because
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.120]   Politicians rely on the largest demographic group in the country to stay in power
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.480]   One of the main goals of a politician is to stay in power for as long as possible until the term limits are over
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.560]   Once you have power, it's really hard to let go
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.600]   I've spoken to many people who have power and they just say look I like the power. I want that power to keep on going
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.280]   It's intoxicating and can set your friends and loved one up for life
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.440]   You know, really you just you got the power you got the power to dictate
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.040]   Who wins and who loses and obviously you can help out your friends and family
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.560]   Power is also the reason why you see billionaires enjoy buying media companies, right Bezos bought the Washington Post
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.040]   Lauren Powell Jobs bought the Atlantic Mark Benioff bought time
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.360]   John Henry bought the Boston Globe
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.440]   Glenn Taylor bought Star Tribune
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.600]   Patrick soon shown bought the Los Angeles Times Sheldon Adelson bought the Las Vegas Review-journal
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.280]   Joe Mancetto
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   Bought fast company and Elon Musk is trying to buy Twitter but not at the price
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.200]   He initially offered but rather maybe 30% lower
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.040]   It's funny because when you're rich you want power and when you're in power
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:51.200]   You want to be rich and it both kind of leads to the same road if you pay attention very closely to our
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.400]   politicians many of whom
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.320]   Become very wealthy very wealthy during their times in office
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.160]   This combination of having your cake and eating it too is one of the reasons why wealthier households like to claim
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.400]   They are also middle-class
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.800]   Learning how to convince people you are middle-class when you're actually very rich is a skill worth learning
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.760]   And I wrote a post about that and it's worth reading. It's about
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.800]   Using sleight of hand tactics so people don't pay attention to you
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.880]   It's about changing the way you speak the way you dress
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.760]   It's actually about empathizing with other types of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds as well
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.440]   So it's worth the read who doesn't want to feel like they belong to a larger group the government always supports
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.480]   Nobody nobody wants to feel persecuted for earning more or having too much whatever too much is
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.800]   Therefore I think we all want to be middle-class whether we truly are or not
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.080]   And that is why so many people identify as middle-class the tricky situation
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.960]   Every politician faces however is determining what income cutoff is eligible and ineligible for free money
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.320]   Deciding this income threshold for a rigged distribution of tax dollars is carefully decided by a team of strategists
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.760]   economists and advisors
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.320]   They don't just one day come up with a hundred twenty five thousand and two hundred fifty thousand out of thin air
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.720]   If the income threshold for free money is too high
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.960]   Then enough people will start grumbling that politicians are providing tax cuts and free money to the rich and since most
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.560]   Politicians entering the office are rich. They don't want to make it too obvious
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.400]   Their policies are also helping themselves and their friends if the income threshold for free money is too low
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.600]   Then politicians won't be able to effectively buy enough support to remain in power
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.440]   Let's be honest folks
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.720]   The vast majority of people would vote for someone if the candidate promised to give them a free
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.760]   $500 $1,000 let alone a free ten to twenty thousand dollars and this is nothing new folks
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.400]   Whatever party is in power
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.000]   This is a strategy they use before midterm elections and before the bigger elections
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.560]   So observe what people do with their money
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.960]   Not what they say be agnostic and just understand that this is the way society is
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.120]   This is the way government is and it will always be this way
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.320]   We've seen this income threshold debated in the past when President Obama wanted to raise taxes on anybody making over
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.920]   200,000 as an individual and any household making over
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:37.320]   250,000 in his administration's eyes folks who made more were considered rich and then eventually there was compromise
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.640]   Now perhaps due to inflation and an increase in overall wealth since then
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.240]   President Biden has now raised the income threshold for higher income taxes to 400,000 per individual and
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.360]   450,000 per household and
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:59.920]   Income taxes are likely going to go up for these income levels if the student loan forgiveness plan gets approved
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.280]   It's just it sets a great precedent
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.560]   given the ideal income to earn while working is between a hundred twenty five thousand and two hundred fifty thousand because again
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.200]   It's the protected income class where you're gonna get subsidies and you're not gonna get your taxes raised
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.400]   Then the ideal income to earn in retirement is also roughly the same
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.880]   After all, most of us would love to live the same lifestyle or better once we no longer have to work
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   Here's the one thing that people don't realize who are working and saving for retirement and I realized this one year in back in 2012
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   2013
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.960]   Once you retire you successfully retire you have enough money your capital you're spitting out passive income
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.980]   You don't need to really save for retirement anymore
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.760]   You know
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.680]   If you've been saving 20 30 40 50 percent of your after-tax income for retirement once you're in retirement
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.240]   You don't have to save that 20 to 50 percent anymore. So suddenly
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.400]   your need for income or your burn is much lower and
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.260]   That is actually a surprise that many people have experienced since they left their day jobs now given
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.360]   We've had a history of saving and being frugal for so long
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.200]   Your natural propensity will be probably to save
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.760]   Even half of what your saving rate was while you were working because that's just what you're used to
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.920]   But you really don't have to do that and when you no longer need to save for retirement in retirement you free up a lot
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.080]   of cash flow
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.320]   So for me personally
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:31.120]   I'm trying to enter the accumulation phase at the age of 45 and I'll talk about this more in a future episode or future post
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.560]   But it's harder to do than you think because we're just used to habit creatures of habit
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.240]   It's just hard to change
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   Since you don't need to save for retirement once you're retired
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:48.280]   The ideal income to earn in retirement is probably closer to a hundred thousand per individual and two hundred thousand per couple
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.960]   And so if you want to figure out how much capital you need to generate a hundred thousand
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.200]   Then it's just simple math to generate a hundred thousand a year in passive retirement income
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.040]   You will need the following invested capital ten million at a 1% rate of return
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.080]   Five million at a 2% rate of return
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.200]   3.33 million at a 3% rate of return
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.920]   2.5 million at a 4% rate of return two million at a 5% rate of return
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.960]   6.66 million at a 6% rate of return and
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   1.43 million at a 7% rate of return a
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.040]   Reasonable rate of return in retirement is somewhere between 2 and 5%
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.940]   The last thing you want to do is take too much risk lose a lot of money and have to go back to work
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:40.080]   Therefore most people will likely need between 2 to 5 million in invested capital
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.600]   to generate the ideal income of
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:50.080]   $100,000 in retirement and I've written in the past how having a net worth of 10 million is the ideal net worth in retirement
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.040]   And that's what the majority of you voted on. So I went with that
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.120]   However based on government analysis of the student loan forgiveness income threshold
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.100]   10 million is probably way too much. You just don't need it
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.420]   So it's just a nice to have but you really don't need it
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.640]   Now obviously not everybody needs to earn a hundred thousand in annual retirement income to have a great life
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.960]   We're talking about the mass market ideal here
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.120]   If you're happy spending fifty thousand a year gross per person in retirement
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:24.700]   Then all you need is a 1 to 2.5 million and if you're happy spending thirty thousand a year per person in retirement
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:31.000]   Then you'll only need six hundred thousand to 1.5 million in invested capital with a 2 to 5 percent
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.380]   Return now with the average Social Security payment of around twenty thousand a year
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:43.020]   You actually may only need two hundred to five hundred thousand invested capital to generate ten thousand dollars a year in retirement
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.760]   Because you add that to twenty thousand and you got thirty thousand a year
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.560]   So this is really doable for folks, you know who've worked twenty thirty forty years
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:59.800]   So I thought this was a really interesting derivative way of thinking about the income threshold for student loan forgiveness
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.500]   And I don't think anybody's talking about it this way
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:09.160]   I would encourage you to use government policies as a guide to live a better life a more
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.820]   Optimal life because we're always trading time for money and as we get older we want to spend more time doing what we want
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.880]   One of the reasons why I felt more comfortable leaving work in 2012 was due to an upcoming
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:29.580]   Change in tax rates. There was a new surtax of 3.8 percent on income from investments coming up in 2013
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.400]   further the highest marginal income tax rate was going up to thirty nine point six percent from thirty five percent and
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.900]   Back in 2012. I was exhausted and I was also bored with my job
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.880]   I wasn't making that much money
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.680]   But I just felt like well if taxes are going up and I'm already really tired
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.600]   That just doesn't sound like a good combination and instead of complaining
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.040]   I just I just just figured out a way out by negotiating severance
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.460]   So really never complain for more than a moment instead do something about a sub optimal situation
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:10.420]   Don't change your life due to upcoming government policies. That's the tail wagging the dog. It's backwards
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.960]   Instead use government policies as a guide to make marginal improvements in your life
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.280]   Government policies were at most 10% of the reason why I wanted to leave finance
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.800]   The main reason why was because I just didn't enjoy it anymore
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   I didn't want the money and I found something else to do with my one and only life in
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.060]   Conclusion if you're making under a hundred twenty five thousand dollars per person
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.360]   You have the green light to continue going to try to make more money
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.920]   To improve on your career because you probably won't get taxed more and you'll probably still be eligible for subsidies
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.080]   over the next couple of years
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.360]   now if you make over one hundred twenty five thousand dollars per person and
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.840]   The more over you are the more you should consider taking it down a notch or two
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.940]   Especially if you're burned out since 2009
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:06.560]   I have carefully recorded how happy I feel based on the amount of money I was making and I'll tell you folks
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.080]   For here in San Francisco after you make over about two hundred thousand per person
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.280]   There's really no more happiness
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:20.240]   You can cover all your basic needs and you can have really nice ones can go on vacation drive a nice car
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.560]   Eat whatever you want. You're good anything more
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.880]   It just doesn't move the needle and so I truly believe that that ideal income where maximum happiness
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.920]   Doesn't increase anymore is about a hundred thousand dollars for America in general
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.700]   So obviously it goes up and down based on the cost of living where you live
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.840]   So the range is probably between a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand per person
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.720]   I don't know where you live and I don't know how burned out or energetic you feel right now
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   But use that range that income range as a guide to help you determine how you want to spend your time
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.560]   How stressed you want to feel at work? And what do you want to ultimately do with your remaining time?
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:08.040]   Time accelerates the older you get and it becomes more valuable because you have less of it every single year
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   So you have to figure out that right balance?
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:17.040]   I'd love to hear from you in a comment in my post whether you think a hundred thousand dollars per person is the ideal income
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.400]   For the mass market and for maximum happiness
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:27.080]   And if you enjoyed this conversation and the way I think that I think you'll really enjoy
