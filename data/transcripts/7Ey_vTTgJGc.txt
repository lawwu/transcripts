[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.740]   given to studies of mental health, physical health,
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.940]   and human performance.

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.600]   is for you.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.180]   So without further ado,
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.540]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.300]   The first question is about task switching.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.580]   And the specific question is,
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.100]   is there a way to get better at task switching?
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.900]   Well, task switching is an incredibly interesting topic.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.360]   It's something that plagues many people.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.460]   That is a lot of people have challenges with task switching.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.940]   It's also a topic that people will often confuse
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.260]   with cognitive flexibility.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.380]   So all of us, well, unless it's been removed,
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.380]   have an area of our brain called the prefrontal cortex.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.460]   The words prefrontal cortex actually refers
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.280]   to a fairly varied real estate within the human brain.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.360]   So it's not one area of the human brain.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.220]   Prefrontal cortex actually includes
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.920]   a lot of different subdivisions that do different things
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.200]   in the context of cognition and directing action,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.340]   withholding action, these kinds of things.
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.700]   But one of the main functions of the prefrontal cortex
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.900]   is that when it's working well,
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.740]   it allows us to direct our focus and our cognition,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.540]   our thinking in a context dependent way.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.660]   So one of the simplest ways to describe this
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.980]   is that when you took math in high school,
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.400]   or if you're still taking math,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.020]   your brain had to carry out certain types
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.500]   of cognitive operations that were very different
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.960]   than the types of cognitive operations
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   that you'd need to carry out in your history class
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.380]   or your social studies class.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.100]   But there were some features of all three of those classes
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.980]   that were the same in the sense that presumably
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.460]   you had to sit in a chair for all of those classes.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.180]   You followed a certain set of rules
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.320]   that pertain to all three of those different classes,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.420]   even though they're different subjects.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.060]   But then there were certain rules
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.780]   that pertain just to mathematics.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.600]   Certain rules that you followed because a particular teacher
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.280]   was strict, not because of the topic they were covering,
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.640]   as well as certain rules
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.040]   that maybe you did not pay attention to
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.120]   because a different teacher was a little more lax.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.240]   For instance, maybe there was a teacher
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.400]   that let you put your feet up on the chair in front of you.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.480]   Maybe another teacher forbid that at all costs.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.440]   The point being that your prefrontal cortex
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.840]   is the area of your brain that,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.720]   along with other areas of your brain,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.360]   ensures that you engage in context specific behavior,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   context specific thinking, and context specific understanding
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.980]   about what you should and should not do.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.220]   Now, cognitive flexibility is similar
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.340]   in the sense that it describes your ability
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.260]   to switch the types of cognitive operations,
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.960]   as the name suggests,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.700]   depending on what sorts of things
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.500]   you're trying to learn or understand.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.860]   And it's a lot more extensive than that.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.620]   In fact, we will probably do an entire episode
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.740]   all about both cognitive flexibility
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.160]   and perhaps even a separate episode on task switching.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.080]   But task switching is somewhat distinct
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.360]   from cognitive flexibility.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.120]   First of all, task switching requires cognitive flexibility,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.080]   but they are not the same thing.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.640]   Now, when we talk about task switching,
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.980]   or rather when you see task switching
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.480]   in the scientific literature,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.600]   most often it has to do with people performing
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   one particular type of mental or physical operation,
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.500]   or say they're maneuvering things with their hands
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.440]   or other parts of their body,
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.560]   or they are required to carry out one specific type
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   of mental process.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.320]   And then they are required either at random intervals
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.800]   or at specific intervals, maybe every 10 minutes or so,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.200]   to switch their attention
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.460]   and to do a different task entirely.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.220]   Now, in the laboratory experiment situation,
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.700]   this has most typically been carried out the following way.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.660]   People are going to do one cognitive task,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.940]   maybe mathematics, or they're going to count, for instance,
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.640]   from one up to infinity,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.020]   as high as they can go in a given amount of time,
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.880]   in increments of, say, seven,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.740]   or increments of seven plus one, then seven minus one.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.460]   So these can be made increasingly difficult.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.380]   You get the idea.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.500]   And then perhaps a tone is played,
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.100]   or they'll get a signal from the experimenter,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.180]   and then they need to switch their task
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.680]   to doing something quite different, but also cognitive.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.180]   That's the most typical arrangement.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.520]   Or another typical arrangement
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.300]   in a task switching experiment
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.260]   is that the subject,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.000]   the person in the task switching experiment,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.100]   will be asked to do
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.680]   some sort of physical manipulation of objects,
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.860]   maybe placement of puzzle pieces
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.080]   into the correct configuration.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.700]   Then at some designated interval or intervals,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.620]   they will have to switch to a different manual task.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.420]   Fewer, not zero, but fewer experiments
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.900]   have examined task switching
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.100]   between physical and cognitive tasks, okay?
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.200]   Now, there are these kind of outrageous examples
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.380]   that you can find on the internet.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.080]   And by the way, I don't suggest that anyone go engage
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.780]   in these examples in real life
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.520]   of kind of extreme task switching.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.340]   One of the most notable ones would be chess boxing.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.420]   Believe it or not, this exists,
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.720]   where two people will enter a ring,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.160]   and they will sit down at a table,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.900]   and they will play chess for a given period of time.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.500]   So they're entirely focused on playing chess.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.960]   Then a buzzer will go off, the chess table will be cleared,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.840]   the chairs will be cleared,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.900]   and they will be expected to box, literally,
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.780]   fight for a round of, say, a minute to three minutes,
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.980]   and then go back to chess, then to boxing,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.320]   so-called chess boxing.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.040]   Again, I'm not suggesting people chess box,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.960]   but I know that many people have challenges
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.260]   with task switching, and here I can raise my hand
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.480]   and say that I am one such person.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.340]   I've always had a pretty good ability
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.220]   to drop into deep focus after a period of time.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.820]   I, like everybody else, takes a little bit of time
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.560]   to get into a book chapter
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.520]   or to get into a mode of physical exercise.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.800]   But once I'm doing something,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.680]   I tend to be very, very focused on that,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.440]   and I have a much greater challenge
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.600]   in switching out of that focus mode to doing the next thing,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.160]   which is one of the reasons why oftentimes I run tardy
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.960]   because I'm still mentally thinking about
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.160]   or physically engaged in the thing that I was doing before.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.800]   This is something I'm constantly working on.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.280]   And as a consequence, I've had to seek out
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.480]   and implement certain tools
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.240]   to improve my ability to task switch.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.240]   So I'm going to share a few of those tools with you now,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.200]   because I know a number of people probably struggle
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.740]   with the same thing.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.760]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.900]   I'm also going to do a full length episode
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.740]   about task switching,
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.120]   both the underlying mechanisms of task switching,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.200]   as well as a more extensive list of tools
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.520]   related to task switching
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.020]   as a full length Huberman Lab podcast episode.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.640]   So how can we get better at task switching?
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.240]   Well, short of having somebody scruff you by the neck
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.860]   and force you to stop whatever activity you're doing
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.560]   and engage in the next activity that you're doing,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.400]   one of the best things that we can do
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.120]   to support our ability to task switch
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.400]   that's nicely supported both at the mechanistic level
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.320]   and at the practical level within the published literature
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   is to introduce short transition gaps
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.820]   between the activities that we're trying to switch between.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.180]   This is something that, in my opinion,
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.720]   has not been discussed enough.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.080]   In fact, when was the last time you heard
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.000]   about the requirement for introducing gaps between tasks
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.200]   if you want to switch between them more efficiently?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.320]   And yet, as a consequence
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.180]   of this not being discussed very often,
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.020]   I think a lot of people have placed an undue burden
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.940]   on themselves.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.280]   For instance, a lot of people think
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.440]   that when you sit down with a book and you're going to read
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.340]   that you should be able to immediately focus
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.540]   on the material that you're reading
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.800]   and not have your mind flitting about.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.700]   During the first five, maybe even 10 minutes
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.760]   of reading a book chapter,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.660]   unless you are absolutely enthralled from the first word
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.020]   or you are intensely curious
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.060]   what the material in that book chapter is, right?
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.560]   Maybe that book chapter is about you
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.280]   and what's going to happen to you next in your life.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.160]   Maybe the news article is about something
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.800]   that you care oh so much about,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.760]   but unless it's one of those specific instances,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.500]   it's going to be about five or 10 minutes
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.080]   before the neural circuits in your brain
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.020]   that are required to understand and digest
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.060]   and commit that material to memory
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.160]   are going to come online at the levels of activity
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.580]   that are going to be required for you to experience that
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.840]   as intense focus or even as mild focus,
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.740]   because the activity of the brain
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.900]   is always going to be in a push-pull.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.460]   This is extremely important for understanding task switching.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.820]   When you go from one task,
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.460]   and maybe the task was simply to walk over
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.060]   to where the book is located,
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.220]   to focusing on the material within that book,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.860]   you have to both engage activity
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.540]   within certain neural circuits
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.220]   and you need to disengage the activity
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.700]   of other neural circuits.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.500]   Now, sometimes this is referred to
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500]   as inhibition of certain neural circuits.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.900]   Other times, it's just going to be a dissipation of activity
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.740]   of those neural circuits.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.140]   It's just going to quiet down
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.540]   like a dimming of the lights in a particular room
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.120]   while the activity of other neural circuits increases.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.500]   Okay, so the first thing that you really need to understand
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.820]   if you want to get better at task switching
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.140]   is that you cannot and you should not expect yourself
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.400]   to immediately drop into a narrow trench of focus
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.580]   or a narrow trench of ability
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.180]   for anything that you're not already extremely skilled at
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.820]   or extremely interested in knowing, okay?
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.780]   One of the reasons why this is often overlooked
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.880]   is that, for instance,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.500]   if we receive a text message from somebody
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.180]   and we are very interested
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.740]   in what's contained in that text message,
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.660]   maybe even eagerly anticipating the dot, dot, dot
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.900]   in that little window
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.180]   where the text message is going to arrive,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.680]   like here it comes, here it comes, here it comes,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.920]   it's an example of where you are able
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.880]   to immediately pay attention and absorb information.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.940]   For instance, if you're trying to meet somebody
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.920]   in a big city and you need to know exactly where to meet them
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.060]   and you've arrived at the place
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.040]   where you thought you need to be
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.700]   and then you can't find them and you're waiting, waiting,
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.600]   where are you, where are you?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.780]   And you're going to commit that information to memory
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.940]   and you're going to act on it.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.940]   But when you sit down to read a book of unknown content
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.660]   or where you have just a general sense
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.560]   of what the content is,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.260]   or when you sit down to do something
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.580]   like work on a spreadsheet or your taxes
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.020]   or engage in a conversation with somebody,
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.300]   expect a five to 10 minute transition period.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.540]   I can't emphasize this enough
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.620]   because I think a lot of people mistakenly think
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.940]   that they have issues with attention
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.020]   and perhaps indeed they have clinically diagnosable
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.200]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.120]   or some other form of attention deficit disorder.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.200]   Certainly can't rule that out
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.900]   based on this conversation alone,
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.420]   but a lot of people place this unfair burden on themselves
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.460]   to immediately be able to focus on a given task.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.880]   And this is also true for physical tasks, right?
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.940]   If you go to the gym to work out
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.900]   or you're heading out on a run or a cycling expedition,
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.340]   the idea that you would immediately be able to cycle
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.480]   at your peak performance
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.300]   or that you could perform sets and reps in the gym
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.940]   and as best as you possibly could without any warmup,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.500]   without any transition period,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.500]   that you could forget about the difficult
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.860]   or maybe even great conversation
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.620]   that you were having on the way in,
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.500]   or that you could forget about other activities
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.580]   that you need to do in the rest of your day.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.480]   I mean, that's just completely unfair
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.200]   and it doesn't match at all
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.500]   the way that your neural circuits work.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.180]   So you really need to match your expectation
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.360]   of your ability to focus on and perform a given task,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.180]   whether or not it's cognitive or physical
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.040]   to the actual underlying biology, okay?
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.320]   So that's the first point.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.700]   The second point is that we know
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.160]   that if you want to switch from one task to another task,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.400]   that you are making it more difficult
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.340]   to drop into full task engagement
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.340]   or rather engagement with task B, following task A,
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.360]   if you try and go immediately from task A to task B,
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.180]   that even the introduction, I find this so cool,
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.340]   even the introduction of an arbitrary
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.960]   but very short transition period of say 15 seconds,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.260]   where you know that you're introducing 15 seconds
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.580]   of transition and you designate it as transition,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.560]   will allow you to engage in a more efficient
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.560]   and more complete level of task execution on task B,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.020]   if you introduce even a brief transition period.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.840]   Now, this I find fascinating because what this means
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.200]   is that there are top-down influences.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.320]   There are literally things that we can tell ourselves
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.480]   based on an understanding of the underlying mechanisms
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   that allow us to task switch better.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.520]   And this certainly doesn't involve taking any kind
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.240]   of prescription drug or supplement
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.720]   or doing anything differently,
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   except as you go from task A to task B,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.000]   knowing and designating that a transition period,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.800]   even a very brief one,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.120]   where you are not trying to perform task B
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.760]   and that you designated this as a transition period,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.880]   I'm not trying to focus on the next thing that I need to do.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.420]   I might focus on it inadvertently,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.360]   but I'm not deliberately trying to focus on it.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.080]   Rather, I'm going to think about what I just did
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.880]   and the fact that I'm no longer doing that,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.460]   kind of leaving it like a fog behind, right?
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.200]   You're trying to move from this deep trench of attention,
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.400]   hopefully on task A,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.120]   or maybe you didn't achieve a deep trench of attention,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.460]   and you're now done with task A,
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.720]   and you're not placing this unfair expectation
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.960]   on your neural circuits to just flip to task B.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.120]   And you're also acknowledging that task B
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.980]   is going to take five to 10 minutes to drop into fully,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.240]   we already talked about that,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.040]   but you're going to shorten that five to 10 minutes
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.600]   by deliberately introducing a transition period.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.440]   And what comes in that transition period
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.520]   and its duration is important.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.060]   So first let's deal with the duration.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.200]   How long should the transition period be?
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.880]   Well, that is going to scale directly
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.780]   with how long you were in a deep trench of focus for task A,
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.180]   but let's assume task A was something
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.400]   that was kind of light for you.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.740]   Maybe you're just handling some email.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.960]   Maybe you're talking to a coworker.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.800]   Maybe you were at a board meeting and it was kind of light.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.920]   You know, the stuff was just okay,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.760]   that you're used to this stuff.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.540]   This is stuff that you do all the time.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.260]   Now you're headed back to your desk
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.000]   or you're headed to your next class,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.020]   or perhaps you did a workout that morning
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.560]   and now you're going to head to your workplace of work,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.680]   or maybe you're leaving work
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.640]   and you're going to engage with family.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.320]   And you know you need to switch
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.640]   all these cognitive operations.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.660]   You need to dump the stuff
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.200]   that you were just doing cognitively
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.540]   and you now need to do a bunch of other things.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.060]   Context is switching, task is switching.
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.120]   Well, just ask yourself,
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.820]   how deeply was I entrenched in that other activity?
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.760]   Was my mind flitting to other things?
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.180]   Or if I was in a deep trench of attention
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.600]   for that given thing,
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.040]   well, then you should give yourself slightly longer
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.280]   for this transition period,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.240]   maybe five or even 10 minutes.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.760]   If you have that time.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.120]   But even if you give yourself
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.560]   as short as 60 to 90 seconds of transition
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.720]   and you just designate it, excuse me, as transition,
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.440]   you're going to benefit in terms of your ability
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.760]   to do the next task.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.160]   So to be very clear,
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.760]   if you were in kind of a light task
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.380]   or something that didn't have much cognitive demand,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.840]   well, then the transition period can be fairly short.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.060]   It can be just a couple of minutes.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.520]   Rather, if you were in a deep trench of attention,
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.440]   you're really engaged in that first task.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.040]   I suggest giving yourself a couple of minutes or more,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.840]   maybe as much as five to 10 minutes.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.100]   But you might not have that much time,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.480]   in which case give yourself any kind of transition,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.960]   even if it's 10 seconds.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.420]   I certainly have had times in my life,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.960]   in particular, when I was a new assistant professor,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.680]   meaning before I got tenure,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.640]   where I remember sitting down to work on a grant,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.800]   I'd get two lines out, someone would knock on the door.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.560]   Hey, where are the, whatever the 30 mil syringe is?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.760]   Where do we keep the buffers?
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.400]   Or where's the, did we get this thing into?
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.160]   Okay, and then I'd have to shift my attention.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.980]   I'd go back to writing
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.240]   and then be distracted by something else again,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.800]   which is not to say that people were distracting me unfairly.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.360]   It was simply the case that at that time,
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.380]   my life required being involved in a lot more things
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.160]   than it did as my career progressed,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.080]   at least in the short term.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.640]   So the point being that if you are deeply engaged
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.340]   in activity, give yourself a little bit longer
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.120]   in the transition period between them.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.480]   If you are sort of superficially involved in activity,
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.980]   you need less of a transition period,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.600]   but you need a transition period.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.640]   What should come during that transition period?
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.240]   Well, the most important thing to arrive
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.080]   in that transition period is a relative lack of attention
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.240]   to anything new.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.480]   This is what's so destructive about the phone.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.760]   And keep in mind, I am not one of these people
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   that thinks that smartphones are terrible.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   In fact, I use mine, plural, very often, all day often.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.920]   Not necessarily during deep cognitive focus,
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   but in between those bouts of focus,
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.240]   I have to text message people.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.580]   I do work on there, I'm on social media.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.580]   So certainly not demonizing the smartphone.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.700]   However, if you finish a given activity,
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.620]   whether or not it's cognitive or physical activity,
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.960]   and you are headed to something else that requires
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.660]   you do a new task and that that task requires
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.260]   significant amounts of attention and focus,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.480]   well, then you would do very well to allow yourself
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.800]   a period of anywhere from two minutes
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.440]   to maybe as long as 10 minutes.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.700]   I know this is going to be very hard for people,
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.340]   but two minutes to as long as 10 minutes,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.040]   where you are not looking at your phone,
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.060]   you're not texting, you're not on social media,
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.720]   you're not foraging for anything.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.440]   In fact, you're trying to limit the total amount
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.520]   of information that you're bringing
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.360]   into your nervous system.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.600]   Now you don't have to walk around with eyes closed
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.480]   and try and not hear and not see, let's be practical folks,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.800]   that's impossible to do anyway.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.720]   You can't shut down your brain while awake.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.360]   You can go into states of deeper relaxation.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.620]   There's a non-sleep deep rest,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.020]   which we'll talk about in a little bit,
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.340]   but you can't shut off your brain deliberately.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.460]   Okay, not in any healthy way that is.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.960]   But by introducing these transition zones
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.120]   or transition periods, as we'll call them,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.420]   of two to 10 minutes between different tasks
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.300]   and making sure that within those transition periods,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.280]   you are not bringing in new information.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.720]   Again, another context, then what are you really doing?
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.020]   Well, you're ensuring that you're not going
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.880]   from task A to task B to task C, right?
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.680]   What we're talking about here is trying
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.280]   to limit your task switching between task A and task B
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.560]   and not introducing another task in between.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.180]   And you might think that looking at your phone
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.720]   is not a task, right?
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.660]   It's so easy, it's so reflexive, but it is.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.420]   It's bringing in a lot of new context,
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.960]   in particular pictures and movies,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.140]   which are tremendous stimulus for the nervous system
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.720]   and anchoring your attention.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.820]   It's bringing in new ideas, new thoughts
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.680]   that no matter how hard you try are going to intrude
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.660]   into your ability to perform task B.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.760]   So when people say, how do I get better at task switching?
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.160]   I immediately want to say,
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.480]   please don't introduce yet more tasks, right?
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.340]   Switching from one task to another is hard enough already.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.320]   Don't introduce another task in between.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.620]   Now, some of you might take this to mean
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.900]   that you shouldn't have a conversation with a coworker
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.760]   after a meeting while walking down the hall.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.880]   I'm not saying that.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.360]   I still encourage people to be social.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.860]   I encourage people to engage in workplace environments.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.960]   However, I will say after many years of working
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.440]   in laboratories that at times were quite large,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   and you walk into the lab
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.960]   and there are a lot of different things going on,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.660]   one of the things that you learn how to do
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.120]   if you're going to get good at your craft
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.740]   is to not pay attention to what's going on
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.640]   with everyone crowded around a computer
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   looking at like who's winning at the World Cup.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.200]   I'm not trying to insult soccer players here.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.640]   I enjoy soccer, both playing it and observing it,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.080]   but one has to sort of scruff themselves a little bit
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.000]   in trying to limit their attention
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.580]   to a number of different things in the environment
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.920]   and really go from task A to task B
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.720]   in a really dedicated way.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.780]   Short lists benefit certain people.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.520]   I know a lot of people are list makers out there.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.380]   They like to put two or three things
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.460]   or maybe 20 things that they're going to accomplish each day.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.400]   One of the best tools that I ever learned
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.280]   both for sake of task switching,
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.060]   but also for sake of just getting things done
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.120]   on a consistent basis.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.420]   I picked up while I was a master's student at Berkeley,
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.240]   a very accomplished professor at that time,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.080]   told me that he writes down every day
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.860]   three things that he's going to accomplish
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.800]   and only three things, never more than three.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.840]   Now, he also included other activities.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   In fact, he was quite active in his physical life.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.900]   So he rode his bike to campus.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.120]   He also was a runner.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.180]   He also went to the gym.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.140]   He did not include those on his list of three things,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.720]   but he would write down no more than three critical things
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.560]   to do each day.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.960]   So he had three critical tasks.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.980]   So I've employed that method as well.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.220]   I'll write down one, sometimes two, most often three,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.840]   but if I can, just one or two tasks
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.480]   that I need to complete each day.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.820]   And everything else is considered part of the,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.900]   let's just say, automaticity function of my day.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.140]   Things that I already know how to do
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.380]   that don't require a ton of cognitive focus,
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.040]   but I limit the things that require a lot of cognitive focus
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.220]   to three things per day.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.620]   However, those three things per day
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.460]   can take up many, many hours each,
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.660]   and certainly on the whole.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.020]   Okay, now there are additional things that one can do
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.580]   to improve your ability to task switch.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.220]   And one of the things that I found particularly beneficial
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.020]   is not a meditation, but rather is a perceptual exercise.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.900]   And this is a perceptual exercise that I learned about
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.380]   when I was a graduate student,
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.820]   but in a totally different context.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.700]   And it has to do with the way that your visual system
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.320]   and the parts of your brain that parse time
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.860]   are related to one another and influence one another.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.220]   Now, the reason this tool makes sense
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.540]   for improving your ability to task switch
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.080]   is because it turns out that where you focus
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.060]   your visual attention strongly influences the way
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.260]   that your brain parses time.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.860]   So I'll describe the tool first,
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.680]   and then I'll get a little bit
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.980]   into the underlying mechanisms.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.360]   But again, I'll get deep into the underlying mechanisms
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.380]   as well as the tool, as well as additional tools
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.180]   in a future episode about task switching
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.100]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:45.100]   So if you were to, for instance, close your eyes
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.960]   and not look at anything in your external environment,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.380]   and just concentrate, for instance, on your breathing
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.300]   or the feeling on the surface of your skin.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.040]   I know this is starting to sound like meditation,
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.780]   but trust me, it's not meditation.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.220]   Your perception of time,
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.220]   that is how finally you are slicing time,
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.300]   would be distinctly different
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.500]   than if you were to open your eyes
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.960]   and focus on a faraway location, say way off in the horizon,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.480]   and not focus on your bodily sensations.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.660]   Similarly, if you were to focus your attention
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.700]   on some intermediate location,
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.380]   maybe let's say 20 feet away,
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.420]   and simultaneously focus on your internal bodily sensations
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.180]   or the surface of your skin, your perception of time,
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.140]   how quickly time was passing, would also be different
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.880]   than if you closed your eyes
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.000]   or if you were looking at some distant location.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.740]   So the perceptual tool for task switching
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.660]   is a very simple one.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.540]   And it's one that, frankly, I do every morning
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.280]   and have for many years now, and at least for me,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.900]   has really enhanced my ability to task switch.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.260]   And that is to just take a couple of minutes,
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.700]   and this really only takes about two or three minutes.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.620]   And typically what I will do is I'll start
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.180]   by closing my eyes.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.660]   Oh, I should mention, I typically do this
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.220]   in an environment where ideally I can see off
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.620]   into the distance, perhaps from a balcony,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.340]   if I'm at an apartment or a house, ideally outdoors.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.880]   But if I'm indoors, I'll still do this.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.980]   I'll just look as far off into the distance as I can
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.020]   when that step is required.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.060]   So, but I start off by closing my eyes
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.980]   and essentially not looking at anything,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.900]   but directing my brain's focus
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.260]   to either the surface of my body,
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.300]   just what it feels like, what it's in contact with
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.860]   or not in contact with, maybe my breathing.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.980]   Then I'll open my eyes and I will focus on some location
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.720]   on my body, but my bodily surface,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.080]   like my hand at some distance,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.220]   and I'll focus my attention there,
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.720]   maybe for just five to 15 seconds.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.700]   I should mention that the first station, as I call them,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.700]   where my eyes were closed
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.180]   and I was focusing on my bodily sensations,
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.300]   I also just do that for about five to 15 seconds,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.980]   and I don't count specifically.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.900]   I'm just kind of roughly five to 15 seconds.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.860]   Okay, so second station,
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.260]   you're looking at the surface of your hand,
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.380]   and if you like, you can also concentrate on your breathing,
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.840]   but typically people will just focus
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.320]   on some specific location on their hand.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.060]   Then I'll typically lower my hand,
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.660]   then I'll look off into the distance,
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.940]   maybe five to 10 feet, doesn't really matter,
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.660]   focus my visual attention there,
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.980]   try and hold that focus for five to 15 seconds.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.460]   Then I'll look further off in the distance,
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.940]   maybe further still off into the distance.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.880]   Ultimately, what I try and do is look at a location
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   as far off into the distance, excuse me, as I possibly can,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.000]   and I'm also trying to pay attention
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.400]   to my breathing at the same time,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.200]   just as a way of calibrating my location
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.840]   to the location that I'm looking at and how great that is.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.240]   Then typically I'll close my eyes and return my attention
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.840]   to my immediate environment
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.340]   and my breathing just in the location I'm in.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.120]   Okay, so the entire thing only takes about two minutes.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.260]   Again, starting with eyes closed,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.160]   focusing on self, five to 15 seconds,
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.760]   then eyes open, focusing on surface of one's body,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.260]   that is focusing one's visual attention,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.960]   five to 15 seconds, maybe 10 feet away,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.640]   then maybe 50 feet away.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.900]   If you're in the metric system, okay, meters, folks,
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.800]   works just as well.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.240]   These distances do not have to be precise.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.520]   And then off to the horizon
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.760]   and then back to one's immediate location
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.000]   by closing one's eyes.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.960]   Now, what is happening
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   when one does this perceptual exercise?
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.640]   And again, it's a perceptual exercise,
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.880]   it's a visual perceptual exercise.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.040]   Well, what's happening is you are shifting
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.280]   your visual focus, obviously,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.440]   but you're also shifting the way in which you find slice
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.720]   or thick slice time.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.920]   Now, your ability to recognize consciously
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.480]   whether or not you're thin slicing or thick slicing time
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.940]   is much harder to get a grasp of
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.560]   than it is to get a grasp of whether or not
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.640]   you're looking at your hand or often in the distance.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.800]   That's kind of obvious.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.160]   But what we know for sure is that as you shift your attention
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.280]   from your immediate environment
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.320]   out to different designated locations in your environment
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.440]   and your time perception shifts accordingly,
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.080]   you're essentially training your brain
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.680]   to shift visual focus
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.840]   and the way in which you process in the time domain.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.420]   And this is important in the context of task switching
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.840]   because so much of task switching
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.920]   is not just to understand, okay,
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.120]   I'm going from reading to running
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.680]   or from running to reading
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.920]   and the different types of operations that are required
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.000]   in one case versus the other,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.640]   but also a shift in the neural circuits
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.200]   that underlie your perception of time.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.880]   And again, this is a topic that deserves
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.120]   a much more elaborate discussion,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.900]   but so much of our ability to execute a task
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.040]   with high proficiency has to do with getting our thinking
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.020]   and our actions into the correct time domain.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.120]   Now, when I say time domain,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.160]   I know a number of people can get confused
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.600]   because time is time, right?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.800]   People think, what do you mean by time domain?
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.280]   Space domain makes sense,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.680]   here I'm not talking about outer space,
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.940]   whether or not you're looking in one location or another,
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.720]   close to your body or far away from your body
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   or different domains of space,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.880]   but the time domain is a little trickier
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.800]   for most people to understand.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.200]   So just think of it this way,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.800]   when you see a slow motion movie,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.080]   what you're seeing is a movie
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.000]   that was shot at a high frame rate, many frames per second.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.880]   Okay, the typical smartphone shoots movies
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.540]   at about 60 frames per second,
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.200]   some older ones, 30 frames per second,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.440]   the slow-mo function on your smartphone
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.800]   is actually a high frame rate function.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.600]   You took the same movie,
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.420]   but you took it at higher frame rate,
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.360]   so you got a lot more images,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.560]   therefore you can generate slow motion.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.680]   So with your visual system,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.360]   when you focus very close in to your body
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.420]   or you're focused on bodily sensations
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.920]   in your immediate environment,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.140]   you are fine slicing in the time domain more so
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.560]   than when you are looking further off in the distance.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.740]   Similarly, when you engage in one type of task,
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.480]   like a board meeting or a Zoom meeting
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.400]   or a conversation with friends,
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.300]   you are in a very different set of neural circuit functions
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   than when you sit down to read or learn math or lift weights
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.220]   or go to therapy or go for a walk with your dog,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.500]   for instance.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.700]   Now, it should be clear why
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.100]   when you move from task A to task B,
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.160]   you want to A, introduce a transition period,
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.080]   can be very brief.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.240]   Maybe you don't even have time
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.720]   for the two-minute transition period.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.580]   You just say, okay, I'm in a transition period
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.780]   between task A and task B.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.540]   I'm moving from this thing to that thing.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.360]   I just need like 10 seconds.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.320]   I'm going to recognize, I'm going to count down 10 to one
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.520]   or one up to 10, doesn't matter.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.760]   This is transition time,
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.280]   but this is not a time to look at my phone
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.640]   or to be in lots of different time domains.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.660]   Now, you might say,
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.020]   well, does that mean I shouldn't look at the horizon
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.220]   while I'm walking from my meeting back to my desk?
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.500]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.860]   That's not the way that your brain works.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.460]   It doesn't anchor to things
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.920]   that just happen to be in your environment
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.560]   unless they're of particular interest.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.620]   What I'm saying is set a transition period between tasks,
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.840]   ideally two, maybe as long as 10 minutes.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.140]   I'm also saying that when you switch between tasks
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.800]   or when you initiate your first major task of the day,
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   please expect, do expect a period in which it's hard
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.480]   to get into the groove, so to speak.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.980]   And in addition to that,
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.900]   I recommend having some sort of practice.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.600]   And I described the practice that I've used
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.260]   for some period of time now,
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.520]   at least for me to great success,
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.560]   where you are deliberately shifting your visual attention
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.160]   between different locations close to you and far away.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.760]   And you're doing that as a perceptual practice.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.940]   Again, the whole thing only takes about two minutes,
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.300]   maybe three minutes.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.840]   And you don't even need to do it every day.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.820]   I happen to do it every day,
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.660]   but I miss the occasional day here and there.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.260]   And even if you were to do this perceptual practice
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.000]   once a week or three times a week,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.040]   I'm certain that you'll benefit
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.960]   because in doing that perceptual practice,
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.380]   there's also an immediate recognition
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.380]   of the sorts of shifts that your brain is required
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.320]   to engage in anytime you move from task A to task B
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.120]   or from task B to task C.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   And you start to see and feel, literally see and feel,
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.720]   the way that that transition occurs
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.160]   and that it takes a little bit of time,
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.360]   but that you can accelerate that transition
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.900]   if you understand that, oh, when I'm looking here
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.860]   and engaging in this type of behavior or sets of tasks,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.900]   and then I'm now going to be expected to do another task
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.640]   in a completely different type of environment,
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.100]   that the brain is going to be required
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.280]   to shift over the neural circuits that are active
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.340]   and less active in order to do that,
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.240]   but that you can accelerate that process by practicing it
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.720]   using that perceptual tool that I described.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.340]   So there I covered some specific tools
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.460]   that one can use to enhance one's ability to task switch.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.660]   Touching on a bit of the underlying neurobiology
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.580]   and why transition periods are useful if not required.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.920]   If you think about there's always a transition period
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.900]   when task switching,
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.400]   but here you're taking conscious control
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.960]   over that transition period.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.460]   There are additional tools
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.600]   for enhancing one's ability to task switch.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.020]   They tend to be somewhat specific
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.440]   for the certain kinds of cognitive or physical tasks
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.900]   that one needs to do.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.100]   The example of chess boxing that I gave earlier,
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.580]   great example of task switching
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.020]   at its extreme terrible example of a practice,
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.940]   space-time bridging, very safe.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.060]   I can't think of any way in which it might be dangerous,
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.700]   although please don't do it while driving
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.300]   or while operating in any other machinery,
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.140]   but by all accounts, very safe, zero cost.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.360]   And we talked about some of the other tools
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.380]   for task switching as well.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.940]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.880]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.260]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.860]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.120]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.380]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast standard channel
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.360]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.500]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.700]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.900]   the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.780]   it's really twofold.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.700]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.180]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.220]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.900]   every Monday in full length.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.300]   We are not going to change the format
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.900]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.340]   and to fund research.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.380]   In particular, research done on human beings,
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.420]   so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.220]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.420]   that we are most interested in.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.440]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.060]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.100]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.000]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.420]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.100]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.420]   and other media channels.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.000]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.200]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.380]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.100]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.120]   in the first place.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.460]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.420]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.780]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.700]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.300]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.260]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.340]   to further support research for science
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.100]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.620]   physical health, and performance.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.460]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.220]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.300]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.060]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.420]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.300]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.900]   and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.260]   that other people ask as well.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.200]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.020]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.920]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.140]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.460]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.820]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.220]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.900]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.800]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.660]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.820]   (upbeat music)
