[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180]   Vanya from Wits and Biases and I just wanted to show you like what's going on here in this in this crazy
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.920]   thing so we're all walking to poster sessions Janik is carrying this like
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.580]   big old stick with it with a poster and
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.120]   Sorry to take a picture behind your head in there and just like we're just walking with every everyone together to hold B
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.400]   which will have
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.280]   maybe a hundred fifty two hundred stands and
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.440]   yeah, it's so so dense everybody's like rushing to see everybody else and
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.960]   we're kind of like
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.260]   In together with them and we're going to set up the booth or I guess Janik is going to set up the booth
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.520]   Which is like tagging along to help them out
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.200]   Help carry stuff and I just wanted to show you how
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.360]   How there's a lot of people here a lot of machine learning engineers are coming to this conference
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.740]   Trying to show off their latest work
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.900]   And actually maybe we'll ask Janik like how do you even find your your place? This is a huge huge place
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.740]   Oh, yeah, and you what you search for to find us is open ass
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.100]   Open ass lovely. That's easy to remember
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:20.860]   Okay, so everybody like whoever's attending and seeing this live go to the whoa app and you probably should have it and
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.940]   We're in before - yeah, we're gonna help set it up with the money and wait some buses crew
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.860]   And I'll just show you what's going on here
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860]   it is
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.340]   Fairly overwhelming and
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.900]   Really super super cool. And so what happens is there's a bunch of talks academic talks on the stage
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.580]   there's great subtitles probably whisper subtitles to the super fast and
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.620]   folks talk about the research, but then you get to actually
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.260]   Have a board and a poster and then people walk you through and you can ask questions
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.720]   Interact with the authors and co-authors you can ask them you can collaborate you can meet and understand research
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   And I think this is like one of the coolest
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.700]   coolest areas of this whole
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.940]   Conference really like huge poster things. So there we are
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.340]   room 414 and
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.220]   It's 414 it's not us
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.020]   402
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.500]   For 12 for 16, it's probably gonna be on this side over there forward I think
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.100]   So we're still that's the row 3 Yannick
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.060]   This is for 10 so probably over there so we're still finding you see how like, okay, so
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.060]   Probably a thousands of this if not 2000 right cuz like we're all like 400 and this this thing still goes on
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.940]   So, yeah, it's kind of like overwhelming to find stuff so you need to know what to look for and
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.780]   Look for open ass
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.660]   402. Yeah come to the booth or to or
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.780]   Blend 402 and then see okay. So literally he's setting up
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.900]   super quick and then many people are gonna come up and
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.980]   We're helping Yannick
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:29.820]   There's gonna be a lot of people just like stepping up asking questions
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.660]   I'm gonna try to to stick around. We'll see you soon
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.500]   All right, so
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.620]   Folks started piling in we found some pins
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.300]   The board is here. This is Yannick. By the way, he has a YouTube channel if you don't follow him definitely follow and he's one of the
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.960]   Co-authors on this open the system conversation, which if you haven't used open system from Leon Lion
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.180]   You should definitely definitely check it out. It's a open playground that you can chat with models and
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.300]   Contribute
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.700]   Assistant style conversation to build a huge data set and then you build a data set of
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.940]   161,000 messages and here's how the interaction happens if people just come up and listen to the author and
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.060]   They're very interested in what he has to say
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.820]   and
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.820]   And there's a few
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.140]   2
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.740]   Thousand conversation that is happening all in real time now
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.420]   The interesting thing is this is more lively
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.940]   But still most of these are papers that were released on archive a while ago and so like the state-of-the-art
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.580]   Models that we know about like a limbs like at least my audience
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.940]   They not necessarily show up here yet
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:56.420]   But there is a setup here where there's the Expo where we weights and biases were a presenter. We're also a sponsor
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.060]   There's also the talks the huge auditoriums that I showed you before if I haven't you'll see pictures online
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.060]   and that's mostly like
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.380]   Dry ish academic stuff. This is lively. This is super cool. Look look how many people
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.100]   And then there's also workshops on Friday
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.540]   So actually you get to like meet with people and talk with people about their stuff and learn from folks like Jeremy Howard
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.900]   From other folks and that's also super cool. So
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.320]   Yeah, this is great. This is like this is how nerves looks folks if you've never been here
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.180]   and if you want to this is how it looks and
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.020]   Yeah, we're gonna go and do some more live stream soon. But for now, I'm just gonna let Yannick do his thing
