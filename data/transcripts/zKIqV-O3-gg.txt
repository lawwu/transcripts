[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   As most of you will remember, we are dealing with the seventeenth verse in the fourteenth
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.600]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, this great statement.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.160]   Let me read to you the seventeenth verse then in the fourteenth chapter of Romans, and also
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.080]   the two following verses.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.240]   For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.640]   Holy Ghost; for he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640]   of men.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.960]   Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith we may
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.160]   edify one another.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.560]   Now, here we must remember, the apostle takes this argument that he's been conducting with
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.000]   regard to these things indifferent, namely what meats the Christian should eat or not
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.960]   eat, and what days he should observe or not observe.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.800]   The apostle suddenly lifts up the whole argument and puts it in its great context in these
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.280]   words of the seventeenth verse.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.880]   He says, "You've got to remember that what after all matters is the kingdom of God."
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.560]   They've been in danger, as we've seen, of forgetting that.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.120]   So he now says, quite apart from the intrinsic merits of these particular points, what we
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.480]   must never do is to regard them just in and of themselves and isolate them from the whole
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.360]   context in which we find ourselves, which is the kingdom of God.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.440]   So the great thing is that we must always understand the teaching concerning the kingdom
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.880]   of God, and remember that as Christians we are now in that kingdom, that it's entirely
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.400]   different from everything else, and that it has its own laws, its own ways, and indeed
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.240]   its own way of thinking.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.040]   So what he's really telling them is that they must learn to think in this new way.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.120]   Of course, he's already been saying that in a sense at the beginning of the twelfth chapter,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.160]   you remember, where he says, "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.040]   of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.880]   This is really another way of saying all that.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.800]   We've got to think in a new way in this kingdom of God to which we now belong.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.260]   And so we've been trying to apply this.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.760]   Indeed the apostle makes us do so.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.240]   He says, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink."
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.200]   Now we've been suggesting that this is a general principle.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.640]   Not only does it apply to meat and drink, eating and drinking, but it applies to many
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.840]   other things also, and it's important always for us to know what the kingdom of God is
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.200]   not, and I emphasize particularly that we must never represent it as being something
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.560]   small or something merely negative.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.120]   That surely is the emphasis that comes out here.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.960]   There's a sarcastic element here.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.800]   The kingdom of God, he says, is not eating and drinking.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   You seem to be reducing it to that.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   It's too small.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.560]   It's too negative.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160]   So we must start with that negative.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   But you don't start with that.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.160]   You don't stop with that.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.600]   The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but, and now we turn to the positive.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.120]   What is the kingdom of God?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.080]   What is it that we've always got to keep in the forefront of our minds?
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.920]   What is it that must govern and control the whole of our thinking?
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.800]   Well, his answer is, it is not in eating and drinking, but it is righteousness and peace
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.280]   and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.760]   Now the question before us is this, what does this mean?
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.840]   What is the meaning of these three terms?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.440]   How are we to understand them?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.120]   It's a question which has caused division amongst the commentators.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:37.040]   There is a division, on the one hand you have John Calvin, Charles Hodge, Shed and people
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.400]   like that, and on the other hand you've got Robert Holden and modern commentator Professor
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.440]   John Murray taking different views as to the way in which we are to understand the three
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   terms.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.160]   Now, as I've often pointed out as we've been working our way through this epistle, it's
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.680]   always interesting when you come across a disagreement between Charles Hodge and Robert
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   Holden.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.560]   They were, in a sense, contemporaries and they were both great Christian men, great
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   Reformed teachers, and men of profound understanding and learning, and generally they're in such
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.000]   entire agreement about most things.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.260]   But now and again we've found that they disagree, and here is another example of their disagreement.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.760]   And as I say, you've got a modern commentator like Professor John Murray agreeing with Robert
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.160]   Holden at this point, rather than as he generally does with Charles Hodge, whom he tends to
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.600]   follow so closely.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.960]   Now what is the different point of view?
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.440]   Well here is the question, if you like, in a nutshell.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.120]   Are these terms, and especially the term "righteousness," to be taken here in the way that they have
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.280]   been used right through this epistle, or do we have to say that here they're not to be
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.320]   used in that sense?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.840]   You remember generally in this epistle the term "righteousness" means the righteousness
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.280]   of God, the righteousness which is from God, the righteousness which God gives us.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.520]   You remember how that was the whole burden and nerve of the argument in the first three
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:27.320]   chapters, where the apostle, you see, turns in the third chapter, for instance, here is
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.600]   one of the great turning points, verse 20 of chapter three, "Therefore by the deeds
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.440]   of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:43.400]   of sin, but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.920]   the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ,"
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   and so on.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.800]   It was introduced, you remember, in the seventeenth verse of the first chapter, but there is that
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.400]   great turning point, and from there on this term "righteousness" is used in that sense
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:12.240]   and in that way, and the same applies to the term "peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.720]   Well now, that is the view that is taken by Calvin and Hodge and others.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.440]   But then you've got Robert Haldane and his followers at this point who take an entirely
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   different view.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.280]   They say, "No, no, here the term doesn't mean that, it doesn't carry its usual connotation
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:43.340]   in this epistle, here it is used as descriptive of men and women, it has an ethical sense."
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:51.160]   So they say what the Apostle is saying here is this, that the kingdom of God is rectitude,
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   right behavior in us, and harmony, and joy.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.680]   Now you see, this is an interesting and obviously a very important matter.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   Which of these two is right?
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.440]   Do we change the meaning that has been given to righteousness right through at this point?
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.600]   The argument is that the Apostle here is dealing with conduct and behavior, and therefore he
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.440]   is describing the characteristics of the members of the Church, and using the terms in this
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   ethical sense.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.360]   Well now, what have we got to say about this?
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:40.960]   Well, I have, if I may use such an expression, greatly enjoyed myself as I've looked into
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.800]   this matter.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:55.280]   And it seems to me that I've got to say that there is a sense in which I agree with both
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.560]   and yet at the same time say that both are wrong.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.520]   Now let me explain what I mean.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:14.040]   The argument is that this is, I say, either the use of the term in its general objective
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:21.000]   sense of the righteousness of God in Christ which he puts to our account in justification
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.880]   and so on, or else that it is this more ethical description of Christian people.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.400]   And those who take that second view say, "But surely the 18th verse proves this, for he
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.080]   that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men."
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.920]   And still more they say in the appeal in the 19th, "Let us therefore follow after the things
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.520]   which make for peace and things wherewith we may edify one another."
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.280]   Well now let me put some considerations to you.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:00.440]   It seems to me to be quite clear that the Apostle is concerned here to remind these
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:09.320]   Romans that they must not give the impression or tend to think again that it is what they
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.820]   do that makes them Christian.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.960]   I'm sure that is included.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.480]   It must be, and it is to that extent that I agree with the teaching of Calvin and Hodge
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.040]   about this statement.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.720]   He's undoubtedly doing that.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.160]   There was this tendency creeping into the thinking of both parties in the church at
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.800]   Rome over these questions.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.440]   There was the tendency almost to say that it's what you do about eating and drinking
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   and observation of days that really decides whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   You remember how the stronger ones were despising the weaker ones, and the weaker ones were
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.240]   attempting to judge the stronger ones, and this was becoming central.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.360]   So that I think that there is this element in it, that he is reminding that they mustn't
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.680]   drop back to that old thinking, which thinks that what a man does or doesn't do is what
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.480]   determines whether he is a Christian or not.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   That's there.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.720]   But I disagree with Calvin and Hodge when they suggest that that is the main emphasis
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.840]   here, or that it is the only emphasis, because I want to show you that it isn't.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.080]   Now another thing which we can lay down, surely, as a proposition is this.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:33.800]   It cannot be right to say that the kingdom of God consists in our ethical behavior.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.040]   And after all, what the apostle is saying is what the kingdom of God is.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.640]   He is giving one of his definitions of the kingdom of God.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.440]   And you see, Professor John Murray therefore says that the kingdom of God is rectitude,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.760]   and peaceableness, or harmony, and joy.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.040]   Now that seems to me to be something which we've got to exclude completely, for the
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:06.160]   reason that the kingdom of God can never be described or defined in terms of our ethical
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:15.320]   behavior, for to do that is again, virtually, to go away from the faith position.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.800]   Now it's another thing to say that citizens of the kingdom of God should behave in a given
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   way.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   That isn't what the apostle is saying.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:28.040]   He says the kingdom of God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:35.440]   So I would rule out that teaching of Haldane and his followers entirely for this reason,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:42.080]   but it's saying that the kingdom of God is our ethical behavior, which seems to me to
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:49.840]   deny the teaching concerning the kingdom everywhere in the scriptures.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.280]   Another argument which I would bring forward is this.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.240]   You must have noticed the parallel between what we are told here, and what we are told
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.200]   in the first two verses of the fifth chapter of this great epistle.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:14.800]   There you read this, "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access into this faith wherein we stand and rejoice
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.840]   in hope of the glory of God."
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.080]   Justified by faith, the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ, there's your righteousness,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.920]   then peace with God, there's the second term, and the third term, we rejoice in hope of
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.080]   the glory of God, there is your joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.400]   Now, the apostle has put the three things together there at the beginning of the fifth
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.240]   chapter, where he's summing up, as it were, winding up his whole argument about justification
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.600]   by faith only, and here again he states it once more.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:05.040]   This is therefore parallel to that, and it seems to me to be very important in our interpretation
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.400]   of this particular statement.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.800]   So I go on to say that as I understand it, the 18th verse and the 19th are not just a
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:23.480]   repetition of the 17th verse, or a further definition of what the Christian man is.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   I regard verses 18 and 19 as deductions drawn from the 17th verse.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.080]   The 17th verse makes the big statement, lays down the big proposition, and then he draws
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.560]   two things out of it.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:46.400]   He says the man who realizes this and lives in this way and is governed by this thinking
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.160]   is one who is acceptable to God and approved of men, and then comes the appeal, let's go
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.480]   on doing this, let us therefore follow after these things which make for peace, and things
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.080]   wherewith we shall edify one another.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:12.440]   So I regard the verses 18 and 19 as deductions from 17, not mere elaboration of 17.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:18.720]   That is a part of the argument of Auden and others, that the 18th verse in particular
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.920]   is just saying the same thing again as is said in verse 17.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   I don't think so.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.440]   I think it's a deduction, and leads to an appeal which is based upon it.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.760]   And in the 17th verse what we have is the grounds of the appeal.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:40.400]   In other words, to me the 17th verse is a general statement of the character or the
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:47.820]   characteristics of the kingdom of God and its citizens.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:56.920]   In other words, in this verse I am arguing that he is not dealing here with ethical relationships,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.680]   but with personal relationships.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.560]   Of course, our personal relationships and our view of our personal relationships will
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:13.000]   show themselves in our conduct and in our behavior, in our ethical living.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.220]   But that isn't what he's dealing with here.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:23.920]   I am suggesting that what he is trying to show us is this, is that these Romans had
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:31.480]   rather forgotten their whole position and their entire relationship to one another,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.880]   and that that is the source of all their troubles.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:45.200]   They were reducing the whole matter of the kingdom of God to attitudes towards certain
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   details and certain practices, and that was the essence of their trouble.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.520]   They had become so involved in the minutiae that they were missing the whole thing.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.240]   I've quoted it before, it's the same thing as our Lord had said about the Pharisees.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:04.040]   "They tithe mint and rue and anise and gum and forget the weightier matters of the law."
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.200]   I suggest that this is an exact, parallel statement.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.880]   And the apostle is saying that they mustn't do this, that they've forgotten what is the
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:19.120]   essential characteristic of the kingdom, and all who belong to the kingdom.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:26.040]   And they're guilty of this reducing of it to the level of these details and minutiae.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:34.080]   Now, in other words, what seems to me to control our interpretation here is this, is that the
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:41.280]   apostle is ridiculing the attitude of these people, and is indeed showing a measure of
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.680]   impatience with it.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.440]   I've been trying to bring this out as we've dealt with this verse on previous Friday evenings.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.880]   I again introduce this whole element of sarcasm.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.880]   I think he does this quite deliberately, he says, "Don't you realize what you're doing?"
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.840]   He's impatient with it, he says, "How can you possibly be guilty of this?
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.960]   You couldn't possibly be guilty of behaving in the way that you're doing with regard to
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:14.200]   these matters of indifference, if you always remembered the great characteristics of the
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.800]   kingdom, and what should be the characteristics of the people who belong to the kingdom."
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.040]   That is why I said at the beginning that in a sense I accept both and reject both of these
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.640]   alternatives that are put before us by the commentators.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.960]   Now, let me produce some supporting evidence in this way.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:41.240]   I suggest that what the apostle is doing here is really the same thing exactly as he does
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.640]   twice over in the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:51.920]   Now go to Galatians 5, let's read the first six verses of the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:19:00.480]   Here I think we've got the same kind of argument, "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:07.680]   Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.400]   Now, don't you feel it coming out?
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:16.820]   You see, the apostle, remember, was a preacher, and he was a teacher, and he was a pastor,
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.720]   and there's an element of feeling here.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.920]   "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and don't be entangled
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:31.240]   again with the yoke of bondage; behold, I say unto you that if you be circumcised, Christ
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   shall profit you nothing."
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.120]   Now, remember, he's writing here again to believers.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.000]   These Galatians are believers, but these false teachers, these Judaizers, have come in and
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.480]   said, "Yes, that's all right to believe in Christ, but you've got to be circumcised as
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.640]   well to bring in some detail, and if you haven't got the detail, you're all wrong."
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.440]   He says, "Do you realize what you're doing?
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.920]   Christ shall profit you nothing if you do that.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.760]   For I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.480]   Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law, you are fallen
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.440]   from grace.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.320]   For we, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.920]   You see, he takes them from this detail of circumcision, he says, "That isn't it, it's
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   this.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.600]   We, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:31.160]   Then, here is the pronouncement, "In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth anything
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:37.520]   nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love."
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.800]   You see, he ridicules this talk about circumcision and this great preoccupation about it.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.280]   It was the very center of the preaching of these Judaeas.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.360]   Circumcision, you've got to be circumcised, this is everything, and that's how he deals
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   with it.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.480]   "In Christ Jesus, if you like, in the kingdom of God, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.400]   availeth anything, but faith which worketh by love."
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:10.120]   He's put it into its context, he's ridiculed, he's shown how false this is, all this preoccupation
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   with circumcision.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:17.080]   But, you see, he felt this so strongly that he has to come back to it at the very end
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.480]   of his epistle.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:26.560]   So in chapter 6 of the epistle to the Galatians, he comes to it again and finishes with it.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.240]   Start reading at verse 12, "As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh," these were
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:38.600]   the circumcision people, "they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.360]   persecution for the cross of Christ," that's their motive, "for neither they themselves
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.800]   who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.320]   in your flesh."
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:22:00.680]   Then one of these flights again, "But God forbid that I should glory in circumcision,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:06.920]   or in the number of people belonging to my party, God forbid that I should glory," thus
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:12.840]   ridicule again, the passion that comes out, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:19.560]   cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, I whom the world is crucified to be, and I unto the world."
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:26.080]   And again, "For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:33.320]   a new creature," a new creature, a new being, a new creation, something absolutely new,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.400]   not an odd detail here or there, the whole thing.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.960]   You see, the same thing exactly, lifts it right up, shows the bigness of it all, and
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:49.800]   shows with contempt the smallness and the pettiness of this wrangling about these details.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.720]   And as many, he says, as walk according to this rule, "Peace be on them, and mercy, and
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.960]   upon the Israel of God," and then I like this seventeenth verse, "From henceforth let no
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:10.440]   man trouble me, no more of this nonsense is the great apostle, no more wasting of my time
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.880]   over this, from henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   Lord Jesus.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:23.560]   Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.680]   Now there, I think, is exactly the same thing as he's doing here in Romans 14, 17.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.440]   "Let's have an end of this nonsense," he says, "you seem to be making this the big thing
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.360]   in the church, this is the essence of Christianity, the kingdom of God is a matter of eating and
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.680]   drinking, no more of this," says the apostle, "it isn't that, it's righteousness and peace
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.760]   and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.720]   So you see, what he's really telling them is that they're in grave danger of forgetting
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:03.680]   their whole position as Christians, owing to this preoccupation with these details and
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:09.280]   with these attitudes towards conduct and so on.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.840]   Very well.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   I suggest, therefore, that this is not merely an ethical description, not merely a description
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.320]   of the kind of life that Christians are to live, it includes that, but it's much more
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.200]   than that, it's much bigger than that.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:31.600]   I say, you miss the whole element of greatness, you miss the element of sarcasm and of contempt
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.240]   and of ridiculing the thing out of court, if you say that it means the kingdom of God
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.760]   is rectitude and peaceableness and joy, oh no, the kingdom of God is infinitely bigger
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   than that.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.120]   It is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:56.500]   In other words, he's saying that the strong and the weak in the Church of Rome are in
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.080]   error over this matter.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.600]   Now, I don't think there's any suggestion here that they were ethically wrong.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.560]   Those who were eating the meat offered to idols were not doing anything that was ethically
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.560]   wrong.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.600]   And the ones who didn't eat those meats, they were not doing anything that was ethically
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.540]   wrong.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.740]   That isn't their trouble at all.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:26.000]   The trouble with them was not that they were being unrighteous in their attitude towards
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   one another.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.600]   The trouble was very much more serious than that.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.480]   They were making their attitude towards these detailed questions determinative of their
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   whole position.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.200]   They were so emphasizing these things as in the end, as I say, virtually to say that this
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.440]   is what makes a man a Christian at all, and that is the thing that the apostle cannot
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   tolerate.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.980]   He's not merely telling them to behave in a better way with regard to one another.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:06.160]   What he's telling them to do is to correct their thinking on both sides and to realize
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:12.960]   that they're reducing the whole idea of the kingdom of God to something small and petty
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.560]   and mere detail.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:25.680]   Very well then, the deduction which we draw is this, in interpreting this word "righteousness,"
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.060]   that the apostle is, in a sense, giving us a definition of the Christian.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.400]   And what he's saying is this.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.240]   You've got to get hold, he says, of this whole notion of righteousness.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   What is it?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.380]   Well, you can put it like this.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:52.840]   The Christian is not merely one who is right in certain respects, or here or there.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.760]   That's the impression they were giving.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.080]   Should a Christian eat these meats and drink, take this drink?
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.760]   Should he observe these days or not?
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.600]   In other words, if you listen to them in their discussions, you would have said, "Ah, well,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.840]   of course, a Christian is obviously one, on the one hand, those, say, who does eat these
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   things.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   He's been emancipated.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   He sees through it all.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.640]   He knows that the idol is non-existent, and therefore there is no harm in eating these
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   meats.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.040]   That's what makes him a Christian, is that he sees that.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.800]   But then the other weaker brother says, "No, no, the Christian is a man who, realizing
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.640]   that that meat has been offered to the idol, doesn't eat it.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.480]   He's got enlightenment to show him that."
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.200]   And so, you see, you listen to them and you begin to think, "Ah, well, this is what makes
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   him a Christian."
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.000]   "It isn't that," says the apostle.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.740]   That's the old type of thinking.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.600]   What decides whether a man is a Christian or not is not his view about these particular
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   things.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.080]   What is it, then?
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:58.640]   Well, he says, "The Christian is a man who has got hold of this teaching concerning righteousness."
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.320]   He doesn't think any longer in detail.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   How does he think?
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:11.000]   He thinks like this, "The Christian is a man who has been declared righteous by God, justification
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.080]   by faith only, God who justifieth the ungodly," or the argument, as I say, leading up to the
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.320]   end of chapter four or the beginning of chapter five.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.560]   This is how the Christian thinks of righteousness.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:31.760]   Not in little details here and there, but in this whole matter of his standing before
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:38.200]   God and the declaration of God that he accounts this man as righteous.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.040]   Not only that, he is a man who knows that he has been clothed with the righteousness
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:51.880]   of Jesus Christ, that God has put this robe of righteousness upon him.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:58.320]   Not only that, he is a man who has been born again.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:09.560]   He has been born of the Spirit, and because of that, he is in an entirely new realm.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.040]   He was in the flesh; he is now in the Spirit.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.320]   But another way of putting all that is this, is to say that he now belongs to the realm
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.360]   of righteousness, whereas before he didn't.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.040]   Now, I want to bring out this point, because to me it is the key to this interpretation
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.100]   that I am giving you of this seventeenth verse.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.280]   So I want to show you how the apostle really has defined the whole thing for us himself
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.800]   in chapter six of this epistle.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:45.680]   Let me read again from the seventeenth verse of chapter six to the end of the chapter.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.960]   "But God be thanked," he says, "that you were the servants of righteousness."
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:57.280]   That's what you were, the servants of sin, that's what you were.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.000]   "But you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.560]   Well, that's a great statement, we have dealt with that.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.480]   He says that you were at one time the servants of sin.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.320]   But now, you've been poured into a new mold, you remember that was our way.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:20.960]   They've been poured into the mold of this teaching.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.160]   They've been delivered into the mold.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   So they're new men.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:34.200]   And now listen, "Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness."
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.960]   You see, there's a translation, a transformation, there's been this great change.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.240]   They were the servants of sin, but they've been made free from that, and they've now
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.840]   become the servants of righteousness.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.940]   This is just another way of saying that they're now in the kingdom of God.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.800]   So you see, it is still not a question of detailed behavior.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.240]   It is that they have become the servants of righteousness.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.280]   Well, then he goes on, "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.280]   your flesh."
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.440]   This is an apology for using an illustration.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:18.800]   "For as you have yielded your members, servants, to uncleanness and to iniquity and to iniquity."
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:25.560]   Listen, "Even so, now yield your members, servants, to righteousness and to holiness."
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:34.240]   Then here is a great statement, "For when you were the servants of sin, you were free
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.280]   from righteousness."
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   What does that mean?
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.760]   Well, it doesn't mean that every action they performed was bad and wrong and evil.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   No, no.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.760]   What he means is this.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.520]   You have nothing to do with righteousness.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.920]   You were not in the realm of righteousness at all.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.200]   You were outside.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.320]   You were free from righteousness.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.880]   Righteousness, you see, is not an ethical quality in the believer in this way in which
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.960]   the apostle uses it.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.000]   It is a realm to which they belong.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.360]   They belong to the realm of righteousness.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   Before, they didn't.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.880]   They were the servants of sin, and they had nothing to do with righteousness.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.840]   They were free from righteousness.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.320]   Then he goes on, "What fruit are ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.480]   For the end of those things is death.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.240]   But now be made free from sin, from the realm of sin, from the ultimate control of sin,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.840]   and become servants to God.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.320]   You have your fruit unto holiness and the end of everlasting life.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:39.200]   For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   our Lord."
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.160]   Now, there is, to me, the key to this whole matter.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.840]   They now belong to the realm of righteousness.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840]   They didn't before.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.720]   They belonged before to the realm of sin.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.960]   It's in that sense that the kingdom of God is righteousness.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.400]   Not merely righteousness in me.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.000]   That's something I've got to work out.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.360]   But the first thing is that I am put into the realm of righteousness.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:12.120]   The kingdom of God is the realm and the sphere and the reign of righteousness, not of sin.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.200]   This is the interpretation of this seventeenth verse of the fourteenth chapter.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:22.520]   Now, the Christian, you see, is a new man and he's in this new realm.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   So now he views all matters of conduct and of behaviour, not primarily in terms of particular
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:44.040]   actions, but rather in terms of his conformity to the kingdom to which he belongs, and to
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.600]   the king of the kingdom.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.240]   This is the difference.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:57.520]   You see, he realises now that this is his fundamental commandment, "Be ye holy, for
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.680]   I am holy."
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:09.600]   In other words, the great distinction is the distinction between holiness and morality.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.680]   And that's the thing they were tending to forget in Rome.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.960]   They were tending to drop back to the level of thinking in terms of morality.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:26.080]   He is always concerned about particular actions and about being legally right.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.760]   All the moral man is concerned about is to be right in this respect and that and the
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.560]   other, and not to be wrong in this respect and that respect and the other.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.200]   He thinks in terms of actions, and what he is, is the summation of what he does and what
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   he doesn't do.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.240]   This is a legalistic conception.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.400]   That isn't the way the Christian thinks about these things at all.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.400]   That's what they were tending to do in Rome.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.280]   It was this question of eating meats or not, or of drinking and not drinking, and observation
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.200]   of days and not observing days.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.280]   They were falling back to that old way.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.120]   They were falling from this liberty that they've got in Christ, this new way of thinking.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.080]   But that's morality.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.600]   Holiness is quite different.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:16.280]   Holiness is always concerned primarily about the whole man.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:24.120]   Not the parts, not the details, not the particulars, but the whole man, his state and his condition.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.520]   Be ye holy, for I am holy.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:35.400]   This is the thing that he is concerned about, and not merely with his actions.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.280]   The Christian man, in other words, is a man who is not content with being right here or
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.800]   there.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.600]   He wants to be right everywhere.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:52.320]   Now, can't you see that hymn we've just been singing by Joseph Leverter?
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.760]   It puts this thing so perfectly.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:01.320]   His desire there expressed is not merely that he might be right on this point and not wrong
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   on the other point.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.440]   He's not looking at details.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:13.120]   This is his prayer, "O Jesus Christ, grow thou in me, and all things else recede."
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.320]   Here's a man who's got a conception of righteousness.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.840]   He wants to be rid of everything that's wrong.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.160]   He wants to be wholly right.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   He's interested in holiness.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   It's a big thing.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   It's a positive thing.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.120]   And the moment you see this, you're no longer interested in these little details.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.800]   The other men, the moral men, of course, the merely ethical men, he says, "Oh, I'm right
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   here.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   I'm right there."
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   And so on.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   And he imagines that he's, therefore, all right.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.520]   But he isn't.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.920]   And that is the tragedy with regard to that man, Oliver.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.320]   So I again put it like this to you.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:59.000]   That the Christian is not primarily concerned about detailed rightness, but he is profoundly
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:11.120]   concerned about being well-pleasing to God, and right in the sight of God.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.680]   Take the Apostle Paul himself.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.720]   He'd been in that old position.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   He didn't do this.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.720]   He didn't do that.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.840]   He'll tell you about it in that bit of autobiography in Philippians 3.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.360]   But he's emancipated from all that.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.040]   Holy ones, now is this that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, no longer
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   my own righteousness, which is after the law, but the righteousness of God, which is my
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.840]   faith through Jesus Christ, or indeed, as our Lord has put it there in that beatitude
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:46.480]   in Matthew 5, 6, "Blessed are they that who hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.440]   You're no longer thinking of whether you should eat this or drink that.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.280]   You're no longer thinking of days and seasons and these particular details.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.560]   You want to be wholly righteous.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.440]   You hunger and thirst after righteousness, to be entirely right.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   This is the thing.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.620]   In other words, this is the essence of Christianity.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:11.000]   As our Lord puts it there in the beatitude, this is a portrait of the Christian man.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.960]   And you're no longer looking at details, but you're looking at a whole person, an
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.280]   entire personality, and he hungers and he thirsts after righteousness.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.400]   Oh, let me put it like this to you.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.720]   The kingdom of God is righteousness, yes.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:34.800]   The Christian is a man who realizes the truth about the people of God.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.440]   And once you begin thinking of yourself in terms of being one of the people of God, you're
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.560]   emancipated out of these small, petty, minute arguments about whether this is right or that
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.480]   is right and wrong, and so on.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.720]   Now, listen to the way that this is put by the Apostle Peter, for instance, in the first
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.640]   epistle and in the second chapter, beginning at verse nine.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.560]   The kingdom of God is righteousness, but you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.360]   an holy nation, a peculiar people, that he should show forth the praises of him who hath
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.960]   called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, which in time past were not a people,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.640]   but are now the people of God, which have not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   mercy.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.480]   This is the thing that interests the Christian.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.860]   He's one of the people of God.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.920]   He's a citizen of the kingdom, and it's a kingdom of righteousness.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.400]   You see, the total outlook is different.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.660]   It's not merely ethical righteousness.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:43.680]   It's this whole concept of himself as a citizen belonging to this great kingdom.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   Very well.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.720]   So I put it again that the Christian is a man who, realizing that he's a citizen of
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:56.600]   the kingdom of God, is primarily concerned about the glory of God and the extension of
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:02.080]   the kingdom of God and the well-being of all who are citizens of the kingdom of God.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:09.840]   The Christian is unlike the Pharisee, who was mainly concerned about ethical conduct
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.960]   and behavior, and about appearing right outwardly, but whose inward part was full of ravening
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.840]   and of wickedness.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.680]   You see, the Christian is not interested in these appearances and in correctness here
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   and there.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.360]   He's concerned about being clean within, this total righteousness, this utter purity.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:36.080]   Or, if you like, let's look at it in terms of the way in which our Lord himself puts
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.440]   it in the third of the parables in Matthew 25.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.700]   This seems to me to put it very well indeed.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.840]   You remember, "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, the holy angels, he shall
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.960]   sit on the throne of his glory, and all the nations shall be gathered before him.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.160]   And he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd divided his sheep from the
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   goats."
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.560]   And you remember the division, "He shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   on the left.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.120]   Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, 'Come ye, blessed of my Father.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.560]   Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.480]   For I was an unhungred, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.960]   I was a stranger, and he took me in naked, and he clothed me.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.600]   I was sick, and he visited me.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.640]   I was in prison, and he came unto me.'
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.840]   Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, 'Lord, when saw we thee unhungered and fed
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.480]   thee, or thirsty and gave thee drink?
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.560]   When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee?
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.240]   Or when saw we thee sick or in prison, and came unto thee?'
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:44.000]   And the king shall answer and say unto them, 'Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.660]   done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.'"
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.400]   You see the point?
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.440]   The righteous are unconscious of their righteousness, but these people in Rome were very conscious
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.440]   of it.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.080]   The strong man says, "I see through this.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.280]   I have a right to eat this."
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.080]   The other man says, "No, he's unrighteous in doing that."
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:07.120]   You see, that's regarding it from the standpoint of ethics and ethical conduct and behavior,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.000]   and so they're self-satisfied, and they can justify themselves.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.240]   But the man who is a citizen of the kingdom of God, the righteous person, he's not aware
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.620]   of his righteousness.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.440]   He's unconscious of it.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.040]   This is the glory of his whole position.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:32.160]   So you see, we are told that the others shall go into everlasting punishment, but the righteous
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.600]   into life eternal.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:41.240]   So the righteous person, the man who is a citizen of the kingdom of God, the man who
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:50.140]   realizes that the kingdom of God is righteousness, is a man who not so much does this or doesn't
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:57.680]   do that, but he is a righteous person.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:06.200]   Now this is the thing I trust that I'm making clear to you, that he is a righteous person,
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:11.920]   which is put by the Apostle Paul again in the epistle to the Ephesians in the fourth
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920]   chapter.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.400]   Listen, here it is once more, beginning at verse 17.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.860]   "This I say, therefore, and testify unto the Lord, that ye walk henceforth not as other
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.960]   Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:31.300]   from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.220]   their hearts, who, being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.220]   and so on.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:41.320]   But you have not so learned Christ, if so be that you have heard him and have been taught
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:48.180]   by him as the truth is in Christ Jesus, that you put off the former conversation concerning
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:55.340]   the former conversation, the old men, which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts, and
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:03.340]   being renewed in the spirit of your mind, that ye put on the new men, which after God
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:10.420]   is created in righteousness and true holiness, or holiness of the truth."
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.740]   In other words, the Christian is a man who is righteous.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.840]   He has become a righteous person.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.900]   He is created anew in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.980]   It's not a matter of details.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.220]   He is a righteous person, whereas before he wasn't.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.420]   I want to bring this to a conclusion this evening.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:42.420]   The kingdom of God is righteousness.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:49.420]   The Christian, the citizen of the kingdom of God, is a righteous person.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:45:02.180]   Over and above what he is indeed, he has been made a righteous person, which means this,
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:07.540]   that he is like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.980]   Listen to John putting it, "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:24.100]   not; and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous."
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.700]   That's it.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.060]   Jesus Christ the Righteous.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.300]   He is righteous.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.900]   So is the Christian.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.180]   Listen, that was 1 John 2 verse 1.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:44.760]   But let me remind you again of 1 John 2 verse 29, "If you know that he is righteous, you
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.300]   know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him."
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:54.660]   Which is John's way of saying this, "If you know that he is righteous, you know that
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:46:02.120]   everyone who is born of him doeth righteousness, because he's been made righteous."
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:07.620]   But he puts this still more plainly in the third chapter of the seventh verse.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:12.340]   "Little children, let no man deceive you.
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:22.500]   He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.460]   That's it.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.660]   You see, he does righteousness because he is righteous.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.540]   That's the right way to put it.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.620]   You don't make yourself righteous by what you do.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:44.100]   You are made righteous, and then the appeal comes to you to show it in your conduct and
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.100]   in your behavior.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:51.300]   Now it was their failure to realize this that was causing all the trouble in Rome.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.940]   They were here with the details and the minutiae, and giving the impression that you make yourself
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.180]   righteous by what you do and what you don't do.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.380]   It's all wrong.
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.080]   The kingdom of God is righteousness.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.540]   The Christian is a righteous person.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:16.180]   He is righteous, and he doeth righteousness because he is righteous even as he, the Lord
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:20.180]   Jesus Christ, is righteous.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:24.540]   So what the Christian is interested in is not that he does this or doesn't do that.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.620]   He wants to be like Jesus Christ.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:34.660]   The kingdom of God is righteousness, and not particular views and actions with regard to
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.740]   particular matters.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:45.300]   So you see, the apostle ridicules and deals with contempt, with all this fuss and pother
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:49.940]   in the church of Rome over these matters of indifference.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:50.940]   Very well.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:55.140]   There it is with regard to righteousness, and God willing we shall try to work it out
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.860]   in terms of peace and joy in the Holy Ghost next Friday night.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.700]   Let us pray.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:13.020]   O Lord, our God, we come to thee and see so much in us, like those people at Rome of old.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:19.740]   Have mercy upon us, enlarge our outlook, we pray thee.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:25.700]   Give us to see that what we are is the thing that met us above all else.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:33.820]   O enable us to rejoice in this, that we who were once free from righteousness have now
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:42.820]   been made righteous, that we are righteous as he is righteous, that thou hast given us
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:50.460]   this new birth and fashioned us anew, that we may be made conformable to the image of
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.020]   thy dear Son.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:49:02.740]   O Lord, we pray thee that we may ever so see ourselves as citizens of this kingdom of righteousness.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:08.580]   We know the day is coming when the righteous shall shine out in the heavens.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:17.140]   Lord, help us to see that this is already in us, and that thou art perfecting it in
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:27.540]   us in order that we may shine in that great day as the children of the kingdom and children
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:32.860]   of God and those who are like unto the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:40.620]   Hear us, O God, and bless us to that end, and now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:46.300]   and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:53.260]   continue with us, now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour, short and certain,
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:59.180]   earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.180]   Amen.
