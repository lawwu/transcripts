[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.700]   - Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.660]   A long time pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.920]   Well, Pastor John, a listener named Lindsey from Memphis
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.140]   would like to call you to the witness stand.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.000]   She asks this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.020]   "thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.560]   "I'm really curious.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   "Do you think John Calvin would have considered himself
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.700]   "to be a Christian hedonist as you define it?"
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.960]   - Oh, I would like to think he would.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.120]   As I define it means I get to spend an afternoon with him.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.960]   Right? - Yeah, of course.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.440]   - I get to talk to him and we sit over the Bible
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.480]   for three or four hours.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.640]   And I haven't had time to do the research
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.680]   to know what the word hedonist meant in the 1500s.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.580]   And so I might have a stumbling block there.
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.520]   I might not, I don't know.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.520]   But if I said to him, "Now, Mr. Calvin,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520]   "there are people who wanna know if you agree with my view.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400]   "And here's my view.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   "I think that it is right to pursue happiness,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.820]   "to pursue joy, to pursue pleasure in Christ, in God,
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.000]   "because I think it helps us honor God.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.940]   "And I think it helps us love people."
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.220]   You agree with that?
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.420]   I think he would pause and he would say,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.060]   "Well, I can think of some verses
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.860]   "that go in that direction."
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.300]   Then he might ask me some questions
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.580]   about what I think about suffering
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.660]   and what I think about sacrifice and persecution
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.580]   and self-denial.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.980]   And I'd give you all my standard biblical answers to that.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.440]   And my own conviction is I think he would say,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.760]   "Yes, I don't know if I like your name,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.700]   "but that's surely what I believe."
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.000]   And so I did have the time to look up some places
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420]   where he says something that gives me hope
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.760]   that he might agree.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.360]   And so let me give you a couple of those.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.740]   He says, "We must therefore constantly call
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.920]   "to our minds this truth,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.000]   "that it can never be well with us,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.660]   "except in so far as God is gracious to us,
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660]   "so that the joy we derive from his paternal favor
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.320]   "towards us may surpass all the pleasures of the world."
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.560]   In another place, he says,
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.080]   "We have all a natural desire to pursue happiness.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.600]   "And the consequence is that false imaginations
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.920]   "carry us away in every direction.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.600]   "But if we were honestly and firmly convinced
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.920]   "that our happiness is in heaven,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   "it would be easy for us to trample upon the world,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.460]   "to despise earthly blessings
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.260]   "by the deceitfulness of attractions to the world
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.800]   "that the greater part of man are fascinated with,
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.700]   "and to rise toward heaven."
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.720]   Or here's another one, "Rejoice and leap for joy."
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.960]   This is his commentary on Matthew 5, 12.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.680]   "The meaning is a remedy is at hand."
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.740]   A remedy for being crushed under persecutions.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.700]   "A remedy is at hand that we may not be overwhelmed
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.620]   "by unjust reproaches,
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.300]   "for as soon as we raise our minds to heaven,
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.160]   "we there behold vast grounds of joy,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.440]   "which dispel sadness."
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.040]   And one other place,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.800]   one of my favorite passages is Hebrews 10, 34,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.080]   where the Christians are identifying with those in jail.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.640]   And when they do that, their goods get plundered.
