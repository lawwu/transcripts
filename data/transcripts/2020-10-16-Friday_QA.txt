[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.040]   - Hi Joshua, yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.900]   I had two questions.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.480]   The first one's about my disability insurance.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.340]   About three years ago, I purchased disability insurance
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.640]   at a job that I was at.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.120]   Had currently, or at that time,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.020]   had covered already 60% of my disability insurance needs.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.260]   And so at the time, I was able to buy a policy
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.700]   that covered, I believe it covered 60%
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.100]   of the remaining 40% of my salary.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.140]   So a relatively small amount of coverage,
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.680]   but disability insurance was pretty expensive.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.040]   So it still was a good chunk for a yearly premium.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.720]   But I felt, I was convinced by some of your shows
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.620]   that that's a very necessary insurance to get.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.460]   And I was happy to get it at the time.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.000]   And now my question is, I have a new job
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.260]   where my income, at least temporarily,
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.800]   is more than 2X what it used to be.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.900]   And I guess I'm curious if I could go
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.240]   and get more disability insurance coverage now,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.980]   which I'm guessing is yes, and if I could,
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.140]   would the cost amount basically increase linearly
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.340]   with the coverage amount?
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.680]   Or is there other multipliers in there
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.700]   that I'm not taking into account?
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.380]   - Short answer, yes and yes.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.860]   When your income increases,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.980]   you're able to qualify for more coverage.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.440]   Now what happens is the percentage of your income
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.820]   that you can cover actually goes down.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.360]   So if you were earning $50,000 per year,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.420]   the insurance company would do a calculation
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.300]   and they would say, well, you're earning $50,000 per year,
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.620]   we're gonna assume you pay a certain level of taxes,
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.460]   but basically at a $50,000 per year job,
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.620]   they would wind up giving you total coverage
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.580]   between your group insurance and your individual policy.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.580]   They would wind up giving you total coverage
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.540]   that would basically be 100%
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.780]   of your pre-disability earnings.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.480]   But if your income increased from $50,000 a year
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.440]   to $150,000 a year, you can get more coverage,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.360]   but the percentage of your earnings
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.180]   that you can cover will go down.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.320]   So it would probably go down at $150,000 salary
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.840]   to something like 80% or 85%.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.120]   If your income increased from 150 to $350,000,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.540]   once again, you could increase the total monthly benefit,
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.320]   but the percentage of your income
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.560]   that you can cover will go down.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.900]   And so if you're at $350,000 of income,
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.180]   they would probably cover 60%
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.240]   of your pre-disability earnings.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.920]   So the short answer is yes,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.200]   and you can increase the coverage amounts,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.900]   but you won't ever get up to 100% coverage
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.620]   when you get up into higher income earning amounts.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.600]   Second question is yes, disability insurance benefits
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   do go in terms of price on a linear basis, more or less.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.720]   So if you were looking at a contract
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.080]   and you had a contract that was for $3,000 a month
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.760]   versus a contract that was for $6,000 a month,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.920]   the price is gonna be fairly linear, not 100%.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.240]   It's not gonna be $100 a month of premium for the one
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.560]   and then 200 for the next,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.640]   but it'll be $100 a month for the one at 3,000 a month,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   and then it'll be $178 for the second one at $6,000 a month.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.480]   So the coverage amount will be fairly linear.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.580]   You do still have the other options that you can change
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.440]   other than coverage amount that will affect the premium,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.640]   duration of benefits, when the benefits start,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.400]   definition of disability, et cetera,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.880]   but as long as you're in the same occupation class
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.760]   previous as you are now,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.000]   yes, it'll work on a fairly linear basis.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.880]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   And the income amount that they're basing it off of,
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.820]   does that always tie to base income
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.360]   or does that include bonuses, stock equity,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.200]   things like that?
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.380]   Is there like a total compensation factor there
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.240]   or is it always going base salary?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.380]   - Depends on the company
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.240]   and depends on the structure of the policy.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.660]   Usually in a group disability contract,
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.820]   those will most often reflect exclusively
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.900]   a base salary coverage.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.580]   They sometimes do include bonuses,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.860]   but they will usually include just simply the base salary
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.560]   for group disability.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.880]   However, for an individual disability policy
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.980]   that you're buying individually,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.940]   those will usually include total income.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.180]   Now, they don't have to,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.260]   but most of the time you will cover total income.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.620]   And so this is one of those things
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.060]   where an insurance agent,
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.180]   when you're talking to an insurance agent,
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.500]   if you are a person who has a large amount of your income
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.860]   made up of bonuses and commissions, et cetera,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.120]   then you can cover those
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.620]   with an individual disability policy,
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.960]   but usually those aren't covered with a group policy.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   But yes, so the answer is it depends,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.340]   depends on the type of contract we're talking about
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.300]   and the basic structure of your income.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.780]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.620]   I appreciate that.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.740]   Do we have time for the second question?
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.580]   - Yep, go ahead.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.100]   - Or should I wait till the end?
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.460]   Okay, so my second question,
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.540]   and actually part of the reason I was coming to you
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.220]   for the first question,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.100]   is my insurance agent that I had sought out
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.180]   from Northwest Mutual,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.700]   and I liked him a lot.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.480]   He worked with us for quite a bit of quotes,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.460]   and then I ended up getting a disability insurance coverage.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.540]   He had followed up the year after.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.020]   The next year, I think I just missed
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.500]   scheduling with him to follow up.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   And then it turns out he unfortunately is disabled himself.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.800]   He's going through a really tragic illness,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.340]   and he's not able to speak
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.340]   and just isn't able to follow up.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.860]   Well, I got a call from someone who,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.300]   I believe I said was from his office,
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.380]   and they were just kind of touching base with his accounts.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.960]   But I sort of felt like I got a little bit
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.340]   of a bait and switch there,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.600]   because this person is associated with Northwest Mutual.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.040]   They do seem somewhat associated with his office,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.580]   although I can't find a direct line for that.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.060]   But he obviously knows my previous agent.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.140]   But this guy is primarily a wealth management person.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.160]   And as I was going through
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.560]   and answering a bunch of his questions
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.960]   during a casual conversation,
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.120]   I kind of felt the switch to him wanting my business
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.520]   as a wealth manager.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.240]   And I had already given him a lot of information
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.880]   that I would have felt comfortable giving
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.400]   to my insurance agent for certain needs analysis
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.620]   and different things.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.640]   And then all of a sudden I felt very uncomfortable
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.620]   giving it to him, 'cause I kind of felt like he was
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.180]   coming in to offer his services
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.720]   beyond just insurance quotes.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.840]   So at this point, and on top of that,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.480]   the guy that was reaching out to me,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.800]   he didn't have any accreditations for,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   what is it, CLU, or he wasn't really a CFP,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.280]   or not CFP, but one of the other designations
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   for being a certified financial planner.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.680]   So long story short,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.120]   it's not like he was giving me any bad stuff.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.520]   It was a good conversation.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.560]   But in the end, I kind of just wanted to send him an email
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.320]   to say, "Can you please destroy all the notes or records
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.660]   "you have of my conversation with you?
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.600]   "Because I really don't wanna continue
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.120]   "going down this line necessarily."
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.920]   But I didn't know if writing back to him in an email
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.560]   is a sufficient way to, I don't know,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.720]   if it's a legal requirement for him to do so,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.000]   but I kind of wanted to force him
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.700]   to somehow maybe destroy those records.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.360]   (laughing)
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.240]   I know it's just a bit of a privacy thing,
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.880]   but I'm not sure if there's any way to really do that
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.640]   now that I've already let that out.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.240]   - There's really no way that you could do that.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.860]   Could you send him the email?
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.700]   Sure.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.520]   Would it do any good?
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.800]   No.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.600]   Basically, the guy would read it,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.100]   and he'd be like, "What on earth?"
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.820]   Like, all I do all day is ask people about their money.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.220]   He doesn't really care anything about who you are
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.060]   or anything.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.680]   And so from his perspective,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.420]   the fact that you told him how much money you have
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.940]   really doesn't matter at all to him.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.520]   - I had a listener of mine who bought one of my courses,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.440]   and then he bought one of my courses,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.800]   and he registered with a, I think it was a 33-mail
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.920]   or I think an opaque email address.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.240]   It was like, you know, 125X57, opaque email address.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.840]   And then he bought one of my courses.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.680]   He didn't like it.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.500]   He asked for a refund.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.640]   I gave him a refund.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.620]   And then he writes back to me and says,
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.360]   "Will you please destroy all evidence of,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.340]   "will you please remove my records from your system?"
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.180]   And I'm sitting here looking at this email address
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.540]   that is xy472@opaque.com.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.780]   And I'm tempted to write him back and say,
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.620]   "Are you kidding me?
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.900]   "The reason is, you're using this email address,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.040]   "which is totally fine with me.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.480]   "Like, I don't care what your name is.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.560]   "I don't care who you are.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.400]   "I just do my best to give, I don't care.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.100]   "It doesn't matter to me at all."
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.980]   And I don't have any records of you that anything like,
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.920]   am I supposed to go to my system and manually delete you?
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.180]   So I just decided, well, it'd be silly for me to respond
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.060]   with some snarky email, that's bad form.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.620]   So I just ignored the email.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.500]   And then he writes me again two months later.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.800]   He's like, "Did you please confirm
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.060]   "that you deleted my stuff?"
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.140]   And I'm sitting here looking at it again,
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.500]   just saying, "Listen, I don't know anybody out there
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.500]   "who's more sympathetic to your privacy efforts,
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.160]   "but I'm not gonna waste my valuable time
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.700]   "to go into my system and try to figure out
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.700]   "how to delete xy125@opaque.com,
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.360]   "this guy who registered with what I'm sure is a pseudonym
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.380]   "and somehow removed you from my system."
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.380]   Like, the whole point, oh, no, it was a pseudo mail thing.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.780]   And I'm like, but this is the whole point you use it.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.860]   If you don't wanna be in my system,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.940]   then burn the email address and move on.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.620]   Like, I don't care, and I'm not gonna take my valuable time
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.680]   to go and do this thing for you.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.700]   So I gotta imagine that you would get
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.300]   a similar kind of reception from that guy,
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.140]   and he wouldn't be anywhere near
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.880]   as sympathetic to privacy efforts as I am.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.540]   But I think that at the end of the day,
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.060]   it's a good lesson for you and for listeners
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.380]   that when it comes to your information,
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.260]   the only way to protect your information
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.140]   is not to tell anybody your information.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.780]   And it's especially important
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.740]   even when you're dealing with things
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.780]   like dealing with financial planners.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.020]   And I've talked about this extensively.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.980]   Now, I don't think that for most people,
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.620]   it's that big of a risk for you
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.300]   to share your personal information with a financial advisor
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.060]   or with a financial planner.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.660]   Most financial advisors don't care.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.800]   Just kind of like doctors seeing naked people,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.780]   financial advisors knowing how much money people have,
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.260]   I can't keep it straight in my head.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.620]   It just doesn't matter to me
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.220]   how much money you have or don't have.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.100]   It doesn't, it's just for most,
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.180]   in most situations, it's really not a big deal.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.980]   But you need to be aware of the fact
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.900]   that when you tell somebody what you have and where it is,
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.660]   you lose control of that information.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.540]   So let me describe what happens in the situation
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.220]   when you're dealing with a financial advisor's firm.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.500]   All the information that you tell them is,
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.100]   in today's world, used to be it would just go into a file,
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.440]   right, somebody would write it on a file,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.040]   and it would be, you know, pieces of yellow paper
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.560]   and stuck into a manila file,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.160]   just sitting in someone's office.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   Now, most of the time, there's a digital system.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.960]   And the digital systems, with any reasonable firm,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.200]   are gonna be decently secure.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.820]   It's gonna be encrypted in some way.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.460]   It's going to be, it's gonna be restricted, usually.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.680]   So a big firm like Northwestern Mutual,
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.500]   the information that's in the notes
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.060]   is not gonna be available to everybody.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.320]   So the guy who is in one cubicle,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.240]   that information is not available to the guy
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.640]   that's in the next cubicle unless he's assigned to them.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.860]   But that information is available
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.560]   at every stage of the chart.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.000]   So you've got the individual insurance agent,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.520]   then you've got the managing director.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.120]   Well, the managing director has an override responsibility
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   for the insurance agent.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.640]   So the managing director can see all the client notes
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.280]   for that particular file.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.480]   Those notes can be seen by the managing partner.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.600]   They can be seen by all of the compliance staff,
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.340]   the compliance officer of the firm.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.180]   They can be seen by the home office.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.520]   And so every bit of information that you give
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.800]   to a financial advisor, to an insurance agent,
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.100]   you should assume is now going to be part
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.520]   of your permanent file.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.680]   And in that situation, if anybody is given access
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.800]   to that permanent file,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.040]   they're gonna have access to that information.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.240]   And so in a situation like you're describing
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.080]   where your primary insurance agent became disabled,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.480]   what happened was, kind of internally,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.160]   the way that insurance agencies work,
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.640]   you have a set of clients,
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.040]   and you have a specific insurance agent
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.960]   who is the primary agent who services that you as a client.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.400]   That's been your interface.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.420]   But in the hierarchy, you have a couple other levels,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.480]   and these are usually called a district agent,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.760]   depending on the terminology of the firm.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.720]   Just the pure insurance terminology
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.200]   would be a district agent,
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.040]   and what's called a general agent.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.900]   And so a general agent is somebody
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.460]   who goes to an insurance company
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.320]   and negotiates a geographic contract
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.480]   for to develop a particular region
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.360]   for that insurance company.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.560]   So they say, "If you'll give me licensing rights
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.520]   "to the state of Pennsylvania,
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.440]   "or if you'll give me rights to the city of Pittsburgh,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.320]   "then with that information,
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.840]   "I'm now going to develop this particular city."
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.560]   And they get the exclusive right to that geographic area
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.460]   and to service people who are within that,
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.080]   to develop offices.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.000]   It's not that somebody can't move in
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.100]   and buy an insurance policy
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.660]   from a guy on the other side of the city,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.520]   but it's that they get the exclusive right,
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.620]   the general agent gets the exclusive right
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.580]   to establish offices for that insurance company
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.800]   within that geographic area.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.180]   Now, that general agent,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.720]   once they establish that contract,
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.460]   it's the general agent's job to go out
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.740]   and to hire and to recruit district agents.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.260]   And so the district agents
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.280]   also get assigned a geographic area,
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.920]   but it's a smaller geographic area.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.400]   It's a specific neighborhood,
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.560]   or you can have this side of town over here.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.160]   And it's the general agent's job
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.240]   to populate their geographic area
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.720]   that they've negotiated the contract
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.680]   with the insurance company.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.760]   It's the general agent's job
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.280]   to populate that geographic area with offices.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.080]   Those offices are going to be overseen
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.280]   by the district agent,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.320]   and then the district agent will now go out
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   and recruit insurance agents, individual insurance agents.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.580]   When an insurance agent sells an insurance policy,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.220]   then the insurance agent gets a commission,
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.820]   the district agent gets a commission,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.900]   and the general agent gets a commission.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.100]   And so the commissions get split,
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.100]   the commission that's paid from the insurance company
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.980]   to the agents,
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.420]   the commissions get split at all three levels.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.860]   But each of the agents,
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.920]   they're all insurance agents,
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.840]   but at each level,
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.420]   they have different goals that they're trying to meet.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.280]   So what happens is,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.320]   when your insurance agent became disabled,
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.840]   the district agent is actually the one
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.080]   who oversees that individual insurance agent's
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.400]   book of business.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.600]   Now that individual insurance agent,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.540]   depending on what happened with his contract
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.480]   with the insurance company,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.840]   whether it was his disability,
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.080]   whether they thought that he would come back or not,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.680]   that's all kind of internal and opaque to you.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.160]   But what happened is that if that insurance agent,
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.080]   if it was decided that,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.280]   hey, he had a really bad illness,
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.880]   he's disabled for forever,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.440]   he's not coming back,
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.880]   then all of those policies that are sold,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.160]   that have been sold by that agent,
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.640]   now roll up to the district agent for servicing.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.040]   And the district agent now wants to make sure
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.940]   that those customers of his agency are taken care of.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.280]   And this is what happens when somebody goes
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.120]   to an insurance company,
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.480]   they work there for three years and then leave, et cetera.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.800]   And so he takes that agent's files,
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.120]   and he divides them up among his other insurance agents.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.880]   Because there's a huge amount of,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.640]   number one, it's just good business, right?
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.320]   They're promising, they wanna service clients.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.200]   But there's also tremendous financial incentive
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.760]   to service those clients well,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.640]   because as people's needs change through the years,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.460]   they'll need more insurance policies,
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.480]   they'll need other lines of business.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.820]   With a big insurance company,
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.840]   it's not uncommon for an individual policy owner
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.780]   to own five, seven, 10 insurance policies
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.400]   with one particular company.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.560]   And so that district agent wants to do a good job
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   of servicing his agency's clients.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.320]   They're called, it's not a very flattering term,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.360]   but it's what they're called, they're called orphan clients.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.480]   So your agent is gone, whether he left the business,
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.620]   retired, died, was disabled, your agent is gone,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.360]   and now here you're an orphan client.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.820]   You still have your policies with the company,
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.080]   but who's gonna service those policies for you,
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.680]   and who's gonna sell you additional lines of business?
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.340]   So the district agent takes them and divides them out
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.280]   among other insurance agents.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.840]   And so the other insurance agents
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.240]   are basically given the file,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.640]   and they say to them, here,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.300]   here's John, who lives in Pittsburgh,
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.000]   go ahead and call John and introduce yourself,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.600]   and we'll assign the file to you.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.840]   So I used to do this all the time, right?
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.240]   I would be given, I was a high-performing agent,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.080]   and so you're given,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.280]   after you've established yourself and whatnot,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.560]   then your district agent will give you these files.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.140]   And so what you do is you call,
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.740]   you introduce yourself, and you do any service work.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.760]   You check up on beneficiary designation,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.260]   see if there are any policy adjustments
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.280]   that need to be made.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.380]   But it's also a fresh opportunity for you
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.840]   to establish a new relationship.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.480]   And now, instead of the person
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.880]   just simply having the district agent's number,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.620]   now they'll have an individual insurance agent.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.780]   Usually there will be now a personal relationship.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.060]   You've met them, they've come in,
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.700]   you've provided in-force illustrations,
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.140]   you've kind of updated, see if anything has changed.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.320]   And if you have a chance to cross-sell on something,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.980]   then you go ahead and cross-sell on something else.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.700]   And so what the guy is,
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.700]   what you're describing is an entirely normal process
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.600]   with any insurance agency anywhere.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.580]   And what that guy was doing was looking to cross-sell.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.740]   He's looking, he's talking to you,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.300]   he's recognizing, hey,
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.380]   here's a guy who has a bunch of insurance with us,
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.020]   but we're not managing any of his money.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.980]   Why aren't we managing any of his money?
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.300]   And is there some way that I can attract him
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.540]   and interest him in our money management business,
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.700]   our wealth management business,
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.700]   in addition to his insurance business?
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.860]   So that's how it works internally.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.180]   And you don't really have any control
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.460]   over the information once you give it out.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.060]   For example, when you took out an insurance policy,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.860]   you listed on that insurance policy
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.780]   all of your individual information.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.820]   You listed your income, you listed all of that.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.620]   And that's now part of the information
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.420]   that the insurance company has.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.300]   There's not a huge danger in this
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.800]   with regard to information security.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.320]   There have been rogue insurance agents
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.520]   and people throughout the years
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.260]   who have stolen people's identity.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.320]   There have been people who would go through the files
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.560]   and steal somebody's name
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.980]   'cause they've got all the info there is in the file.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.760]   You've got your name, you got your birth date of birth,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.300]   you got your social security number,
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.140]   you got your address,
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.140]   and you've got everything you need for identity theft.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.300]   And so insurance agencies and wealth management companies,
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.060]   the compliance officers are pretty strict about this.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.920]   And they watch very, very carefully
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.380]   for any kind of sense of fraud or illustrations of fraud.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.820]   That does happen on occasion.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.780]   And if that happens, then there very clearly is a case,
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.220]   a criminal case that's brought,
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.740]   and the insurance agents prosecute those rogue agents,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.220]   the insurance companies prosecute
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.460]   those rogue agents very hard.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.340]   But short of that, short of actual criminal fraud
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.260]   and theft, identity theft,
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.460]   you don't have any control over the information,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.620]   and there's no right to privacy that you have
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.340]   other than their duty to engage
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.820]   in reasonable protection of your information.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.580]   But let's say you start going through,
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.860]   you all of a sudden,
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.420]   you told your insurance agent all about your money,
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.100]   and you applied for new disability insurance
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.160]   based upon your 2X higher income,
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.900]   but now all of a sudden you wind up getting divorced,
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.940]   and you didn't tell your wife
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   that you were making 2X higher income,
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.480]   you were just trying to hide that.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.540]   Well, if that comes out as a component of your divorce case,
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.980]   then your wife's divorce attorney
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.500]   can subpoena those records,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.920]   and now those records will be used
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.040]   to demonstrate that you're not selling the truth,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.140]   and you told the insurance agent
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.900]   you were making such and such amount of money.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.260]   Which is why I have tried to be clear,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.340]   when it comes to financial planning,
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.620]   you need to think very carefully
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.780]   about what you want to say to a financial advisor,
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.060]   and what information you want to give
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.500]   to an insurance company.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.100]   If you're going to be hardcore for some reason,
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.140]   just due to your makeup,
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.900]   and your desire for privacy, whatever,
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.900]   if you're gonna be hardcore,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.860]   where you don't want anybody to know
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.460]   anything about what you have,
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.860]   then not only can you not tell anybody at all,
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.580]   but more importantly,
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.780]   you're probably not gonna be able
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.140]   to even get the policies.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.700]   If you can't demonstrate that,
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.300]   hey, I make $100,000 a year,
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.140]   and here's my pay stub,
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.860]   you're not gonna get the insurance.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.740]   So this privacy of financial information thing is difficult.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.580]   It's one of the reasons why,
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.860]   you know, I don't advertise my consulting services very much
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:54.020]   because I don't devote a lot of time to it.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.460]   But when I have done that over the years,
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.620]   I've often said,
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.220]   I'm about the most private financial advisor,
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.620]   like I'm about the only way
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.340]   that you'll actually get a private financial consultation.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.380]   Because I don't care what name somebody gives me,
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.700]   I don't care about any identifying information,
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.100]   you can just give me the details.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.980]   I don't keep records,
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.820]   I don't keep notes,
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.620]   I just simply write it all down on a piece of paper,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.580]   and at the end of the day,
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.140]   I drop the piece of paper in a shredder.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:19.980]   And I have no,
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.660]   because I don't sell insurance,
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.900]   and I don't sell investments,
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.700]   I have the ability to do that,
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.540]   and it's legal.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.220]   I just simply give information,
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.700]   just like I'm telling you right now.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.460]   So that's an overview of the business.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.540]   What I would say is don't worry about it.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.900]   You can't change much about it.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.420]   Even if you did go and change it,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.540]   even if you requested it,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.500]   chances are the guy would probably not delete it anyway.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.900]   If I were an insurance agent,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.100]   I wouldn't delete it.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.740]   Because I would get concerned now,
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.700]   if I'm going in and I'm keeping my notes in the phone call,
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.900]   now I'm putting that into our,
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.420]   probably most, at this point,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.220]   the vast majority of files are kept digitally.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.780]   So I put this into client notes,
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.380]   that here's my information on the phone call,
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.300]   that John's got X number of dollars,
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.420]   and he's got this and that and the other thing.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.300]   Well, if I go in and I delete that note,
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.060]   number one, it's not even possible really
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.100]   to delete the note.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.380]   Because there's always gonna be electronic record of it.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.620]   But now if I delete the note,
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.980]   my compliance officer's gonna come up and say,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.260]   yo buddy Joshua, why did you delete this note
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.220]   about all your phone records with John?
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.660]   And so, I wouldn't worry about it,
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.540]   and it's not possible to remove it, is my summary for you.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.580]   - Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.980]   Especially the overview of how the business is structured.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.300]   And that's pretty much what I assumed anyways,
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.060]   exactly to the point of what you said at the end,
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.580]   where it might actually be problematic
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.780]   for them to delete notes or bring up questions.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.180]   So I kind of figured I was screwed in that way anyways.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.940]   And really the biggest thing that I felt sort of offended by
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.580]   was just the bait and switch of like the guy
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.180]   that doesn't even have the CLURA,
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.340]   the insurance designation came in under that guy's.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.500]   But again, it probably isn't such a big deal,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.580]   and maybe I should just not worry about it.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.380]   So I appreciate it.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.060]   One follow up, if the guy that I was working with
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.780]   was a managing director,
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.420]   would there be ways for me just to call Northwest Mutual
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.180]   and ask who his district agent was
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.620]   to see if there's someone else that is properly accredited
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.540]   to talk to about insurance products,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.420]   or would they just point me back to the same guy?
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   - Yeah, so let me talk to that for a moment.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.060]   So obviously, as the possessor of numerous credentials,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.260]   I think that credentials matter and they help a lot.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.820]   And in many cases, credentials are a very good sign
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.220]   to watch for to see is this person knowledgeable
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.460]   about what they're doing.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.060]   There can be various reasons
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.700]   why somebody doesn't have significant credentials,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.380]   and that may or may not mean that they are a good
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.060]   or a bad agent or a good or bad financial advisor.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.380]   I know a lot of certified financial planners
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.580]   that I would never want giving financial advice
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.060]   to my wife if I'm dead, right?
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.500]   That's always the example I use.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   I always tell her, okay, listen,
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.540]   this is the person that you go to if I'm dead,
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.380]   this is who you take financial advice from.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.940]   I know a lot of financial CFPs
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.540]   who I wouldn't want giving financial advice.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.860]   And I know a number of people
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.900]   who I would want giving financial advice,
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.180]   and to my knowledge, they're not necessarily CFPs.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:19.100]   So I don't view that, I view it as one indicator of many,
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.620]   but not an exclusive indicator
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.260]   of everything that can be done.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.180]   Now, what it may indicate,
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   and with a company like Northwestern Mutual,
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.540]   what it often does indicate
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.820]   is if somebody has no credentials,
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.500]   the first thing that you wanna look at
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.260]   is you wanna look at actually what their,
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.360]   if you have an email from them,
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.820]   look at their email signature.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.360]   And these big companies that mix insurance and investments,
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   they'll have usually about three different labels
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.440]   that people will use.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.900]   And if you read the disclosure language, right,
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.220]   the page and a half of language
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.060]   at the bottom of the email that they sent you,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.700]   if you read that, it will tell you
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.620]   what the person's status is.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.340]   And so with most of these big companies,
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.500]   the first thing that they'll have
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.180]   will be some kind of what's called
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.420]   a financial representative of some kind.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.100]   The term financial representative
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.620]   is a term that is tilted in the lingo
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.340]   and the parlance of the financial industry
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.540]   in the direction of insurance sales.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.780]   And so the term financial representative
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.620]   may include somebody who's licensed to,
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.740]   they will be licensed to sell insurance,
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.840]   'cause that's the first thing.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.060]   They may or may not be licensed to sell investments.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.060]   And so if you read the disclosure language,
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.220]   you'll see whether or not there's an investment company
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.820]   reflected in the disclosure language
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.660]   or exclusively an insurance company.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.160]   And so the financial representative is one business model.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.860]   Then the second business model
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.460]   is what's called a financial advisor.
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.080]   So if somebody's business card says financial advisor,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.200]   that's going to indicate that, first of all,
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.860]   they are licensed to sell investments.
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.460]   And more importantly,
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.140]   they're going to be licensed to sell investments
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.140]   and they can also do that and they can work as a fiduciary
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.020]   and they can also charge fees for investment management.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.600]   So usually with a big insurance company,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.900]   like a New York Life or a Northwestern Mutual,
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.560]   most new representatives
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.020]   will start as a financial representative
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.340]   and then they may move to be a financial advisor
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.720]   if they want to do the investment business.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.700]   The third model
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.980]   is what's called a wealth management advisor usually.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.620]   And a wealth management advisor
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.380]   has a slightly different structure
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.180]   where now they'll be licensed with,
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.980]   usually the trust company
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.540]   that the insurance company owns
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.160]   and they will have
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.660]   a slightly different management perspective.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.540]   Now, these are technical FINRA regulations
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.060]   as to why there's these different names.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.580]   It's totally opaque to the consumer.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.380]   The consumer has no idea what any of these things mean.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.020]   But these are technical regulations
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.060]   indicating is somebody Series 65,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.420]   is somebody, are they operating as a fiduciary
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.020]   or are they not operating as a fiduciary?
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.140]   What exactly is their structure?
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.940]   And so, why did I go into this?
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.780]   Just simply to point out
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.060]   that what the lack of credentials might mean
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.120]   is it might mean that somebody is new to the business.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.380]   Sometimes people will,
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.020]   in servicing these clients,
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.420]   there's no requirement
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.860]   that the district agent
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.340]   has to assign this orphan client file
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.900]   to somebody who's new
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.420]   or somebody who's not new.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.180]   Now, usually they won't assign the file
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.260]   to somebody who's brand new
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.860]   because the person who's brand new
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.020]   is usually not good enough.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.100]   They don't understand enough
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.260]   to effectively service the client.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.540]   So, usually they'll assign these
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.780]   to people who are experienced,
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.420]   a little bit experienced.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.740]   But there's a range in that.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.940]   And so, sometimes they will assign an orphan file
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.860]   to somebody who's new.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.820]   And remember, the district agent
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.020]   doesn't know any of the details.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.840]   They just simply have a list of names.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.660]   And the filing system indicates,
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.580]   hey, so-and-so insurance agent has become disabled.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.540]   He had 1,347 clients.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.340]   So, let's take these 1,347 clients
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.220]   and we'll assign 50 of them per month
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.180]   to these five agents in our business.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.220]   And it's just an assignment in a computer.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.220]   There's no individual personal information.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.760]   Now, if you don't like the guy
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.660]   that called you for whatever reason,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.940]   just say, I don't like you
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.420]   and I don't wanna work with you.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.740]   And then call the district agency up
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.260]   and say, listen,
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.280]   I would actually like to talk to an insurance agent,
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.540]   but I would like somebody who has a CFP
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.580]   or has a CLU and a CHFC.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.100]   I'd like someone with a little bit more experience.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.180]   Will you please reassign me?
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.140]   And they can reassign you.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.540]   And it's not a big deal to have that done.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.580]   So, if that's what you're looking for,
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.480]   is just to have an individual agent, but someone else,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.460]   then yeah, you always have the right to call up and say,
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.540]   hey, I'd like somebody else
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.100]   and talk to another insurance agent.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.500]   And it does happen from time to time.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.740]   And I think that although most insurance agents
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.640]   want their clients to be their clients,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.300]   at the end of the day,
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.780]   my theory has always been if somebody doesn't like me,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.800]   then you need somebody that you do like.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.660]   And not liking somebody is totally fine.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.180]   - Yeah, thanks.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.020]   I appreciate that.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.660]   And as far as the conversation with the agent went,
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.980]   or agent or the representative went, it was okay.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   But in doing, I was trying to take some of your advice
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.660]   from old shows and do my research
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.980]   on the people I'm working with.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.980]   And I had found some less than admirable things online
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.260]   about this person as far as just old Facebook postings
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.100]   and all those things.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.260]   But he is younger and maybe that's just gonna come back
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.420]   to haunt anybody of his age by leaving those things up.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.220]   - It's a double-edged sword working with an agent.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.260]   Here was how I used to do it.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.820]   So when I started in the insurance business,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.260]   I was 23 years old and I really didn't know much.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.660]   You go through the basic learning process
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.420]   that you would go through
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.420]   is you take an insurance licensing course,
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.820]   that's 40 hours, right?
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.860]   In the state of Florida it was.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.500]   It was a 40-hour class where you learn
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.860]   about life insurance, disability insurance,
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.700]   and health insurance.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.540]   And then at the end of that,
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.780]   you get your state insurance license,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.100]   that licenses you to be able to sell life insurance,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.020]   disability insurance, and health insurance.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:57.020]   Then you go through some form of training by your company.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.260]   And so in my case, it was three weeks of training
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.180]   with the company.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.540]   Most of that training will usually be tilted
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.380]   in the direction of sales training.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.820]   There will be some basic product training
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.620]   of here's what our company's products are,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.980]   but the company, most of the training will be sales training
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.020]   because that's what the company's in the business of doing
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.860]   is training, training, training, training, training.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.340]   It's training, training salesmen to sell.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.220]   Here's how you sell.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.820]   Here's how you actively approach people, et cetera.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.220]   So a lot of the product knowledge
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.500]   comes through the form of self-study.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.860]   So you can't, and you can't,
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.940]   they don't give you hours and weeks and weeks and weeks
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.780]   of product knowledge.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.520]   And then quickly you're out there in the streets selling.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.660]   Now, when I was a young insurance agent,
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.780]   what I always looked at it
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.100]   is I would tell people who are older,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.740]   I was like, listen, I'm new in the business.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.380]   I don't know everything there is.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.220]   But I'll tell you what,
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.420]   I work a lot harder than most other people
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.540]   and I'm pretty smart and I get good answers.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.900]   And so if I don't know something,
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.260]   I'll tell you I don't know it and I'll get the answer.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.600]   And then if I don't know the answer to something,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.180]   I go and ask a senior agent,
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.740]   somebody who's been around for 40 years,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.900]   and I say, hey, how does this work?
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.940]   Or I call the home office and I talk to the attorneys
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.100]   and you can speak to a product specialist and say,
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.860]   explain to me how this particular thing
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.820]   in our insurance policy works.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.500]   And so I think there's a good argument to be said
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.580]   for working with somebody who's younger,
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.780]   who's actually much more motivated to help you.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.140]   When I was new in the business,
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.360]   I would do anything for a client.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.620]   Once I had a little bit of revenue built up,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.380]   once I had a broader client base,
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.460]   I still wanted to provide good service,
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.420]   but I would not waste my time chasing down some answer
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.500]   for somebody who was annoying.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.740]   I would just bump that person off and say, that's it, next.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.380]   You know, I'm not gonna waste my time
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.100]   working with somebody who's annoying,
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.380]   who's sucking up all my time
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.060]   with all of these intricate questions, et cetera.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.860]   And so that's something that happens over time
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.900]   just from the business perspective of the insurance agent.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.540]   And so you should assess it both ways.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.340]   I don't think that having somebody who's young
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.020]   and who's novice is necessarily a bad thing
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.220]   in the world of insurance.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.500]   And let me be clear,
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.300]   when I'm here, I'm talking about insurance.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.880]   And the reason I say that is because at the end of the day,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.880]   your contract is a contract with an insurance company,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.660]   not with an individual sales representative.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.340]   So I could happily, at 23 years old,
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.460]   I could sell an insurance policy
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.060]   to a big, established, super rich guy,
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.980]   and it wouldn't bother him
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.860]   that I was the guy who sold the policy
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.020]   because his contract is not with me.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.780]   He's not establishing his relationship with me
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.060]   at 23 years old.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.060]   He's establishing the relationship
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.520]   with the insurance company,
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.380]   and I'm the salesman putting the deal together.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.600]   I'm getting a commission, I'm gonna service it,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.580]   but at the end of the day, it's the insurance company.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.000]   Now, that is very different
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.060]   when we get into the world of investments.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.740]   Now, depending on the type of investment strategy,
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.320]   it may be a little bit different or a lot different,
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.460]   but it is different when you get into investments
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.580]   because now with investments,
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.180]   especially if you're having some kind
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.120]   of fee-based arrangement,
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.580]   if you're giving some kind of authority
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.700]   to the financial advisor,
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.180]   some form of control over your accounts,
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.820]   control over your investment strategy,
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.980]   now that is one of those areas
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.980]   where you really don't wanna be working
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.180]   with somebody who's novice and who's junior,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.820]   but in the world of insurance,
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.080]   I think you can safely and effectively work
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.240]   with a young person,
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.260]   somebody who's not particularly credentialed
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.940]   because your contract is not with them.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.740]   Your contract is with the company,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.220]   and if that person demonstrates themselves
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.980]   to be motivated to get the right answers for you,
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.340]   then that's a pretty good thing,
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.020]   and I think that what is common,
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.820]   what most of those companies will teach,
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.140]   and I've had friends with,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.620]   even though I used to work for Northwestern Mutual,
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.100]   I know that system,
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.660]   or at least how it was when I was there,
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.660]   but I also still have,
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.020]   I have friends who are district agents
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.300]   with other companies and who run offices
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.180]   with other companies,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.140]   and so what is very common,
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.500]   and you have to recognize this,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.860]   is that people know,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.540]   first, the individuals know
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.580]   when they get in over their heads.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.220]   So if you are Mr. Megabucks,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.620]   and you're looking at some complex scenario,
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.780]   and your attorney has just told you
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.900]   to buy $20 million of second-to-die life insurance,
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.420]   well, that junior agent
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.060]   is gonna be super excited about the case,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.540]   but the first thing they're gonna do
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.500]   is they're gonna pick up the phone,
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.780]   and they're gonna call one of the senior agents,
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.660]   the guy who's been doing this for 40 years,
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.420]   and they're gonna have the team
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.460]   of advanced planning attorneys in the home office
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.100]   working on the case, et cetera,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.740]   and so they're gonna bring in the people on the case
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.940]   that are needed to get the right answer,
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.700]   but the vast majority of stuff is not that complicated,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.900]   and so if you've got a couple of life insurance policies,
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.340]   disability policy or two,
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.220]   there's just not that much need for,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.060]   that's not advanced insurance work.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.540]   You don't need somebody who's a CLU,
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.140]   CHFC, CFP, blah, blah, blah,
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.940]   to do well with buying disability insurance.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.220]   It's not necessary.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.660]   They will, so judge the person based upon,
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.340]   do they give me honest answers?
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.900]   Do they say, "I don't know"?
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.180]   Do they seem like they're willing to listen to me,
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.820]   or do they seem like they have an agenda,
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.860]   and it's just a matter of,
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.060]   "Hey, here's what I'm gonna pitch to you this week."
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.380]   Those things are, to me, the most important things
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.860]   when it comes to insurance,
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.820]   because they have the resources,
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.580]   and if at any point in time you feel like,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.020]   "I like this person,"
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.260]   they listen to me,
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.780]   they're not just trying hard to sell me something
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.100]   that I don't need, they're not ignoring me,
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.980]   but I like them, but they might need a little bit of help,
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.860]   just ask them, say, "Listen, can you bring in somebody
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.460]   "who has a little bit more experience with you next time
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.820]   "and do some joint work?"
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.820]   And then that's the way you get access
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.980]   to a more senior insurance agent.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.780]   - Okay, thanks.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.500]   Yeah, I appreciate the perspective on that,
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.260]   and I definitely knew that was where you came from,
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.220]   and you had some insecurities about being young
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.060]   in the role early on from your previous stories.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.300]   So yeah, good to get that perspective.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.260]   I appreciate it.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.100]   - My pleasure.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.420]   It is interesting, and you gotta figure out
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.180]   where you are in the whole long,
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.140]   where you are in the chain,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.060]   because youth can be, as I said,
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.260]   youth can be an advantage or it can be a disadvantage.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.300]   And somebody who's young may not know a lot,
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.780]   but they'll also probably work really hard for the business.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.700]   And once they get into it a few years,
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.620]   then most insurance agents that are successful,
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.620]   if you start to become a difficult client in some way,
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.060]   they'll fire you and move on.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.980]   And fire you just means they just stop.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.900]   With investment business,
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.980]   most financial advisors too will fire their clients
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.220]   if they have any self-respect,
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.700]   is you get rid of your most difficult clients constantly.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.300]   The clients that cause you all the trouble,
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.580]   every year you get rid of your most difficult clients.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.940]   And so in that situation,
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.060]   you actually have to physically facilitate
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.800]   the transfer of accounts,
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.920]   which means it's a more proactive process.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.940]   With insurance agents,
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.500]   if all somebody has is insurance policies,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.140]   they just stop calling you,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.740]   may or may not return your calls,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.500]   and just move on with their life.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.580]   And so people have this perspective
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.020]   that insurance agents,
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.740]   and I was reading in an online personal forum the other day,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.300]   and someone was talking about how,
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.300]   can't believe insurance agents selling insurance.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.140]   And I look at it and I say,
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.440]   well, that's true.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.780]   But there's a whole other side of it,
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.940]   where a good insurance agent is worth a whole lot of money.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.260]   And at the end of the day,
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.400]   it's the consumer who writes the checks,
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.640]   but most insurance agents are not suffering for business.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.540]   And so there are two sides to it,
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.060]   and both sides need to win
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.860]   in order for the whole thing to work.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.140]   Jacob in Wisconsin, welcome sir.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.700]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.420]   Jacob in Wisconsin.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.140]   - Can you hear me now?
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.220]   - Now I can hear you, you're on.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.260]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.100]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:47.920]   - Call me this time.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.340]   Well, as I was trying to say before,
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.020]   thanks for taking the time to do all the stuff.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.580]   Sorry about the technical difficulties,
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.380]   I guess you'll have that from time to time.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.580]   So I'm calling in,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.060]   I've listened kind of on and off for a while.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.240]   And one thing that I don't think
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.020]   I've really heard you talk much about is land contracts.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.340]   Bringing that up because I guess the possibility
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.580]   has been presented for my wife and myself
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.620]   to purchase a family home through a land contract.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.940]   And so I'm trying to kind of work through
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.220]   maybe the possible pitfalls of that,
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.860]   or the benefits, and that sort of stuff
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.020]   on a land contract and get your thoughts on that,
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.780]   sort of get that outside opinion.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.020]   I've talked to a lot of family about it
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.260]   and that sort of thing.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.020]   But sort of see what you have to say
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.700]   and maybe get into even the specifics of it
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.860]   as we kind of break that down a little bit.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   But yeah, I guess I kind of want to start
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.060]   with your thoughts on sort of the land contract process
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:52.460]   and if you have much experience in that sort of thing.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.620]   - Short answer, I don't have any experience.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.780]   I've never done one.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.620]   I've never provided very much advice
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.020]   and I'm not an expert in the area.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.460]   So about the most I can do is help you
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.460]   with a couple of intelligent questions,
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.460]   but I don't have any insight
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.140]   to effectively help you in that area.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.700]   So let's start here.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.780]   What are you concerned about?
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.380]   You've got a deal that you think is a good deal.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.060]   You think about doing a land contract.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.220]   Why is there a voice in the back of your head
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.900]   saying maybe I shouldn't do this?
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   - Well, so I guess to give a little bit of a background on it,
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.020]   it's an older house.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.620]   It's been in my wife's family since it was built
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.620]   and I want to say that was in the late 1800s.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.300]   And it's her parents
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.740]   that are wanting to do the land contract with us.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.220]   I guess terms of that deal are pretty good
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.220]   and they're talking about like $100,000 over 15 years.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.060]   And since they're with land contract,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.860]   they're technically like the financer.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.340]   So that means that they set the interest rate,
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.300]   which they're doing 0%.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.420]   And it's all stemming out of my wife's grandfather
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.660]   passed away earlier this summer.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.860]   And so some shifting around happened
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.700]   to who was living where, that sort of thing.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.540]   But we had, in a normal, I guess,
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.380]   getting a mortgage thing, right?
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.460]   There's always like the inspection and stuff like that
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.540]   with land contract that's not required.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.380]   But we did that anyway,
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.580]   'cause this would be our first house.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.340]   We're both in our late 20s.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.380]   And so we brought in an inspector
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.860]   and there's a few things,
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.020]   given the age of the house, right?
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.940]   That are there that need to get addressed.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.140]   But he also kind of made comments
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.820]   that he would actually like to come back and see it again.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.340]   And that's not something that is difficult.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.980]   He'd almost want to do a second inspection.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:38.820]   I guess some background,
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   like my father-in-law is sort of a handyman
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.660]   and he does a lot of the work around there.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.980]   And it passes for a lot of things.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.140]   And he's definitely skilled in what he does.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.660]   He's done a lot of stuff there.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.420]   So a lot of stuff there,
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.940]   I think that was sort of a red flag
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.620]   from the inspector's standpoint.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.380]   And so I think it's some of those things
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.020]   with the age of the house and that sort of thing.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.340]   And in hearing what the inspector kind of recommended
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   that has me specifically kind of on the,
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.780]   how good of a deal would this be?
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.980]   Is this maybe too risky,
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.340]   even with the terms of the deal being precedingly good?
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.660]   - Okay, so let's describe as I understand,
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:23.300]   your father-in-law, your grandfather had an older house.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.580]   This is an older house, you said built in 1880?
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.300]   - It's somewhere around there, it was late 1800s, yeah.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.380]   - Okay, so this is a very old family house
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.860]   that your grandfather owned,
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.100]   passed it on to your father-in-law,
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.860]   or sorry, your wife's grandfather owned
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.500]   and then he passed it on to your father-in-law
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.340]   when he died? - Yeah.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.180]   - Okay, so now--
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.940]   - Well, yeah, sorry.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.900]   - Okay, so--
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.460]   - They moved into his old house
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.420]   and then we'd be moving into theirs
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.100]   and that's where the land contract comes in.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.540]   - And this house, the house in question,
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.500]   previously your parents-in-law were living in it?
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.780]   - Correct. - Okay.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.060]   So now they would like to get rid of the house,
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.540]   they don't need it, they're not living in it,
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.500]   they would like to get rid of the house
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.860]   and it's a family property
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.900]   and so they could put it on the open market
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.340]   but they're looking at it and saying,
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.740]   hey, this would be a good house for you guys to own,
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.980]   we'll give you a good deal on it
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.060]   and we'll sell it to you in the form of a land contract.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.740]   And the idea is this way, we'll sell it to you,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.380]   you'll make payments to us
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.060]   and when the full payments are made,
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.620]   then you'll have the full title of the property
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.160]   but that will assume,
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.300]   that will mean that you don't have to go and get a mortgage,
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.900]   you can just simply make us payments.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   We're gonna sell the house to you for $100,000
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.820]   at a 0% interest rate
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.020]   and so we're gonna take $100,000,
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.060]   divide that into, what would that be,
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.980]   180 months, 15 years
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.740]   and that's gonna be your monthly payment
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.980]   and at the end of this 15 years, you'll own the house.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.820]   Is that right?
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.600]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.700]   So the basic risks both ways,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.520]   the risk number one is if you,
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.740]   if you enter into this contract with them,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.380]   the biggest risk I guess, if you stop paying,
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.100]   you don't own anything.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.260]   So if you go 10 years into it
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.260]   and then you stop paying on the house
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.780]   and then you leave, you don't actually own anything.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.980]   It's not like you can sell the house
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.740]   and then pay off the balance of the mortgage.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.860]   The contract is that you pay it off for 15 years
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.780]   and in this situation, they would be legally entitled
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.540]   to keep your 10 years worth of payments in that situation
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.960]   because you don't own anything
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.100]   until the contract is fulfilled.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.860]   On the other hand, you know,
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.500]   even though it seems like a good deal
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.060]   and it was a house, it's 100, it's a very old house
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   and you don't wanna get in over your head
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.220]   and overpay for something, et cetera.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.220]   Is that a good summary of kind of your concerns?
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.740]   - Yeah, I think it's that.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.220]   I mean, the hard part too is really
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.580]   the way that they got the house
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.620]   was through sort of the same manner.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.400]   And so, you know, they're basically trying to pass on
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.560]   some equity that they have in it,
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.960]   which is roughly 50,000 according to like tax records.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.200]   But I also don't know when the last time, you know,
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.080]   the house actually had an assessment to know,
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.360]   you know, given its condition, what it's actually worth.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.560]   So there's sort of that risk there that has me concerned,
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.520]   especially after getting sort of the inspector's report
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.760]   and that sort of thing.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.680]   And so like, at the beginning,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.040]   it seemed very much like this is a great deal, obviously,
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.520]   if everything is kind of as it looks,
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.760]   but then kind of getting into it,
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.960]   there's just some of those concerns on it.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.840]   - So do you have any reason to believe
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.400]   that your wife's parents are not working with you
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.240]   in good faith?
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.400]   Do you have any reason to think
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.240]   that they're concealing anything from you,
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.920]   that they're trying to cheat you in some way?
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.640]   Is there anything, any reason you have
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.720]   to doubt their integrity in the situation?
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.120]   - No, I wouldn't say so.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.600]   I think they're definitely more on the really excited
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.440]   at the opportunity and I think kind of pressuring us
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.920]   to make the decision to do it simply
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.200]   to kind of get us in a house and other things.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   They know that we've been on that market.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.920]   - Yeah, they want you to,
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.840]   this is something that they think
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.400]   is a very good thing for you,
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.960]   and so they're pressuring you to do something
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.520]   that they think is good for you, which is understandable.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.880]   Now, as you observe your father-in-law's skills
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.560]   as a handyman, do you respect that he does things well,
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.960]   that he does things properly,
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.840]   or is he the kind of person that you have the impression
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.360]   that he cuts corners in some way
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.960]   and just doesn't do things well?
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.760]   Or does he do things with excellence?
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:39.120]   - You know, at times I probably put it kind of in between.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.280]   You know, I wouldn't say it's like the best stuff ever
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.560]   'cause his primary job, he's actually a pastor,
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.560]   so this is something that he kind of does
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.000]   to help pay the bills sort of thing
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.040]   'cause it's a very small town.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.880]   So he's definitely very skilled for the area
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.660]   and stuff like that, but the inspector really noted
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.880]   on some things that definitely,
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.520]   it's apparent that he's more of a handyman
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.040]   rather than like an actual general contractor.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.080]   So just me, I'd probably put him at a little more skilled,
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.960]   but kind of I think from the outside perspective,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.880]   that it seems more apparent that it's more
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.680]   in that sort of handyman level.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.080]   - Do you and your wife like the house?
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.640]   Do you wanna live in the house?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.720]   - I'm kind of in between on it.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.240]   My wife definitely does.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.520]   It's the house that she grew up in,
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.200]   so there's some of that, right?
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.160]   It's been in the family, so I think there's some
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.360]   pressures there that are different
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.200]   than what would be on a normal house.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.560]   So that's sort of a component.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.120]   - If you didn't do this deal, if you didn't buy the house,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.220]   what would you do?
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.560]   - We'd be staying where we are.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.160]   We're currently renting in a town probably
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.680]   30 minutes away from there, so not really
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.760]   anything would change drastically.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.720]   - Do you think that's a better course of action in some way?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.280]   - I think it keeps more of the options out,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.720]   or options on the table moving forward.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.520]   Simply, I mean, the land contract, like you said,
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.000]   the terms are over a certain amount of years
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.960]   and you don't really have actual ownership
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.180]   until the very end.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.520]   So there's some concerns with that,
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.200]   just if life decides, like, hey, we need to move
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.880]   somewhere else that's not the same.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.040]   If it was a normal mortgage, right,
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.000]   then it's like, okay, you sell it
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.600]   and you take what equity you had and you move, right?
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.920]   So there's some aspects of that.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.880]   - How much money do you and your wife have saved right now?
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:38.640]   - Saved, we probably have 20,000 or so
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.200]   in readily accessible cash and then probably
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.040]   another 10 or 15 for, like, retirement accounts.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.640]   - Great, great.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.000]   Do you think you could get a mortgage on the house?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Have you looked into that or thought about that?
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.840]   - I have thought about that.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.000]   And really the thing sort of keeping me from that,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.200]   some of it is for the terms of it, right?
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.280]   Like having sort of the 0% thing
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.320]   and just looking at that from like a pure number standpoint,
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.280]   it's kind of hard to rationalize like, oh yeah,
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.560]   I do the mortgage just for the added protection thing.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.360]   So I haven't looked to get, you know,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.880]   like pre-approved or anything like that
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.240]   for something like that.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.040]   We have in the past for more than what that mortgage
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.560]   would be, so it's not like an issue there.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.000]   I know that, I don't know, something I had sort of
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.320]   talked about with, my mom works for a bank
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.600]   and so I talked with her about it early on.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.400]   And there, there's some, I guess,
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.840]   more like tax implications, right?
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.440]   'Cause my in-laws would have to sort of write,
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.440]   I can't remember, like a gift of equity sort of letter
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.920]   with the bank and to offset the difference
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.520]   between what the value is versus what we'd actually
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.000]   be paying and so I think there was
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.600]   some extra complications there.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.400]   - Hmm.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:52:00.360]   I guess here's my, here's my instinct
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.280]   and you can filter this through the actual details
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.960]   but I think if I woke up in your shoes,
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.840]   here's how I think I would approach it.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.840]   The first thing that I would think about
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.880]   is do I wanna live in the house?
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.320]   And think about what that would mean
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.680]   in terms of your lifestyle.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.440]   One thing that is challenging is that
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.600]   if this is your wife's family home
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.760]   and this is your wife's parents that would be,
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.840]   that are trying to do something nice for you
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.680]   and give, give, you know, give her a gift,
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.240]   you know, and allow her to live in that house
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.000]   and do something to get you guys established
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.920]   in a positive scenario, that can be a wonderful thing,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.680]   right, it's nice to receive nice gifts.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.560]   It's wonderful when your in-laws are generous with you.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.600]   That can also be a very difficult thing
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.640]   if there are somehow strings attached.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.520]   And so I would assess that, is this the kind of thing,
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.760]   are these the kind of people who in doing this for us
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.720]   and in trying to give us something,
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.280]   are they the kind of people who are simply giving us a gift
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.120]   and they're excited for us
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.440]   or are they the kind of people
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.680]   who are gonna give us something, give me a gift
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.960]   and then there's gonna be strings attached to it?
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.000]   I personally, just as a husband,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.600]   I personally would rather walk away
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.120]   from almost anything, no matter how nice the gift
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.360]   that had strings attached, then take it.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.760]   But I will take any gifts that's an actual gift
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.920]   but I'm not gonna do anything
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.600]   with strings attached with my in-laws.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.280]   Not, you know, that's just a bad recipe
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.080]   for disaster in my marriage
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.680]   and a really difficult thing to handle.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.440]   The second thing that you need to think about
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.360]   with regard to that specific house is,
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.880]   will that put you in a difficult situation in some way?
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.600]   Is that gonna be, is it gonna affect your wife
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.240]   in some negative way where she's living
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.160]   in this childhood house?
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.400]   Or is it gonna be the kind of thing
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.320]   where she's gonna be so attached to the house
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.080]   that if you believed that, you know,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.880]   eight years from now you should move somewhere?
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.600]   No, I can't, this is my house that I've lived in.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.680]   Again, not a right or wrong, but think through it
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.800]   before you put yourself in that situation automatically.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.920]   It can be difficult for you as a husband
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:16.200]   if you're living in the same town as your in-laws are
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.400]   and your wife is in the same town that she grew up.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.240]   And not only that,
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.500]   but it's the gift of the house from the in-laws.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.240]   Well, now that puts in a situation
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.640]   where if there's a time of difficulty in your marriage
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.200]   or if she's unhappy in some way or you're unhappy,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.240]   well, all of a sudden now you didn't leave and cleave,
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.080]   right, you didn't take her away
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.360]   and you guys start your own life.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.520]   Rather, you were kind of the hanger on in the family
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.560]   that wound up taking advantage of the family largesse
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.120]   and then that turns out to bite you in some way
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.480]   in your marriage down the road.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.060]   Now, hopefully none of those are the case,
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.200]   but if you have any suspicion or concern
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.600]   that they might be the case,
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.400]   then it might not be a good thing to do.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.320]   And so consider that with as much objectivity as you can.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.960]   How long have you guys been married?
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.600]   - We've been married five years now.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.160]   - Okay, so five years, you should have had enough time
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.700]   to make sure that there's a clear separation
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.640]   from her parents, from your parents.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.760]   You should have had enough time now to judge your marriage
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.000]   and say, could our marriage handle being this much closer
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.480]   to mom and dad, et cetera.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.680]   So five years is good.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.840]   If it were five months, I would discourage you against it.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.600]   Five years at this point, you have enough left life
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:29.420]   as a married couple to be able to assess those things.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.920]   The next thing that I would do is for my own sake
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:35.080]   is I would get an appraisal done of the house.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.880]   Hire an appraiser, pay the fee out of my pocket
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.280]   to get an actual appraisal done of the house
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.880]   so that you have an idea of what the house would appraise at
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.800]   and get it professionally done.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.080]   Because that appraisal number would be important
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.960]   for you to know from a mortgage perspective
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.800]   and also just from your own personal perspective.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.340]   Now, it's up to you whether you wanna share that
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.400]   with anybody else.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:02.560]   Maybe the house appraises at being worth $250,000.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   Well, probably you should share it, right?
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.960]   And it may give her father and mother just tremendous joy
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.120]   to say, look, we're giving you this awesome thing.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.080]   Or you might say, guys, you should sell this house
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.840]   and just take the money.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.220]   Or like figure that out.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.800]   But I think you should at least know the number.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.320]   You should know that if this house
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.560]   were put on the open market,
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.140]   here's the appraisal number
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.360]   that a mortgage company would use,
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.480]   here's probably what it would sell for.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.160]   Now, most of the handyman stuff,
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.320]   I don't think that would bother me.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.160]   If you've got an inspection, you've got an inspection,
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.880]   but at the end of the day, the house is old,
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.880]   which means that you're gonna be fixing stuff
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.520]   and updating stuff regardless.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.760]   And so it's gonna have its idiosyncrasies
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.280]   and you can probably fix most of that stuff just fine.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.080]   I would say that if he was living in it
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.300]   and if he's got decent skills as a handyman,
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.220]   most of the stuff is probably fine.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:54.080]   And if he's genuinely done something that was wrong,
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.040]   then you can change it or redo it.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.000]   But it may have just been a matter of a difference of style
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.320]   or a difference of the materials that we would use now
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.640]   versus what was available eight years ago.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   But a guy who's a handyman, who's fixing up his own house,
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.160]   he's not gonna do anything.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.840]   He's not gonna intentionally do bad work on his own house.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.400]   He's gonna do the best work that he can
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.840]   with what he's got at the time.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.600]   So I would probably take advantage of it.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.220]   And I think the land contract,
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.840]   as long as you understand the terms of it,
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.840]   and then I would talk with my in-laws.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.880]   And even if it's not in the contract, I would say,
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.320]   "Listen, what would we do if we bought this house from you
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.900]   "using the land contract, and then seven years from now,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.240]   "we decided we needed to move?"
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.200]   Or if he's a pastor, right?
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.160]   "The Lord called us away seven years from now.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.840]   "What would we do in that situation?"
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.720]   Well, then talk about it now,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.920]   and it won't hurt anything to talk about it.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.080]   But it sounds to me, from what you're saying,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.720]   like a great opportunity for you guys to have a nice house,
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.540]   to have a gift of a little bit of equity.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:56.360]   If you like the area, if you think you'll be there,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.880]   then 15 years, 0% interest on $100,000 house,
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.800]   that could be a real blessing for you.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:06.920]   - I think that's, thanks for the input, I guess.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.760]   I don't know if this is what I'm trying to say there.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.160]   But there's a few things there I think I have,
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.760]   I can think a little bit more on that I haven't yet,
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.400]   and some of the stuff I have sort of covered.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.920]   So, yeah, I appreciate your input and thoughts on that.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.760]   - One thought.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.400]   What I would look at,
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.200]   and maybe talk with a real estate attorney about,
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.240]   or a friend of yours who does land contracts,
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.440]   or something that you can find some expert advice.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.800]   I've never done a land contract,
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.900]   so I don't know what the normal language is.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.720]   But I would certainly look at it,
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.120]   and I would see if at all possible,
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.520]   I would put an early buyout clause in there.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:46.560]   So, to give you the option of buying the house out
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.920]   at an earlier date.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.360]   Because I think that if you could put in
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.000]   some kind of early buyout clause,
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.360]   and again, I don't know if this is normal or not,
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.320]   so we're up against the limits of my knowledge.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.240]   But there's no reason, I don't know of any reason
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.780]   why you couldn't put one in there,
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.200]   to say that you could buy out the property,
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.040]   we're gonna sell the property for $100,000,
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.240]   which is basically $555 a month, right?
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.760]   100,000 divided by 180.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.560]   But at any point in time,
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.040]   you have the option to prepay the contract.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.320]   And so then, if you're five years into it,
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.840]   and you've paid off $30,000 of the contract,
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.700]   but you still have $70,000 and you wanna move,
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.880]   then you would have the option
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.540]   to simply finish buying the contract out,
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.440]   so you hold the title, and then sell the house yourself.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:34.440]   So maybe you at that time have $40,000 saved,
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.720]   and you go to another friend of yours,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.080]   and you borrow $30,000 from a friend,
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.520]   or a mortgage company, whatever,
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.200]   and you buy the contract out,
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.680]   and then now you own the house free and clear.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.320]   And so that might be something that I would do,
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.120]   is that they're trying to be nice to you.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.080]   They don't need the cash right now,
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.480]   so they're trying to be nice to you,
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.440]   and say, you can pay this off in 15 years.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.280]   But once you start it,
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.400]   then there's no reason for you not to pay it off in seven,
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.040]   and then the whole thing goes away.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.400]   Because if it were a shorter term contract,
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.360]   and you knew that you could buy the house right out,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.200]   then it would be a simpler thing to do.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.480]   And I guess the final thing that,
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.080]   it would be clearly a really good move for you.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.020]   And again, maybe that's just a standard part
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.720]   of a land contract, but if not, I would put that in there.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.200]   The last thing that I would do,
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.720]   is I would have a real straight heart to heart,
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.680]   and I would say, listen, if we buy this house,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.160]   it's our house.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.700]   So I don't want you coming in,
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.720]   when we're coming in for Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.160]   and you come into the dining room,
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.120]   that was decorated in your father's,
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.040]   in your mother's 1960s wallpaper,
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.920]   and you find out that we've stripped out the wallpaper,
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.320]   we've put shiplap on the walls,
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.880]   and we put a farmhouse sink in,
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.800]   I don't want you coming in and crying and saying,
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.320]   oh, but where's the rooster wallpaper that was here?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.600]   This is our house.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.000]   Because those things matter.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.940]   And so you gotta make sure that when you buy it,
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.520]   that they're not gonna have the strings attached.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.920]   They gotta make sure that they understand
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.460]   that this is gonna be our house.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.200]   So if we want shiplap and a farmhouse sink,
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.660]   then we're gonna do that,
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.200]   and don't give us little comments
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.960]   about how it was better before, et cetera.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.880]   Don't cross those lines.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.060]   I think there are a lot of families
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.680]   where they're very healthy,
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.240]   and the parents understand,
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.300]   like this is my daughter, she's married to you now.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.280]   She's not, yes, she's our daughter,
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.800]   but she's married to you now,
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.800]   and if this is your house, it's your house now,
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.880]   and we'll be glad to come over,
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.920]   but we're not gonna make comments.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.340]   But then there's also people who are super controlling,
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   and they wanna come in and cross those boundaries.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.200]   And so I would address it in a direct way before the fact,
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.560]   and I would look him in the eye,
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.400]   I would look her in the eye,
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.780]   and I'd say, listen, we're excited about this,
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.320]   we appreciate your gift,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.240]   but I wanna be clear that if we do this,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.520]   this is gonna be our house.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.400]   Are you gonna be upset if we take out the wall
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.280]   that was housing great-granddad's china collection
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.120]   or something like that?
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.840]   Like this is gonna be our house.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.880]   Are you okay with that?
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.280]   Are we genuinely gonna sever your ownership of it,
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.320]   and it's gonna be our house,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.120]   or are you gonna be frustrated
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.280]   that we're doing something wrong to the family property?
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.720]   So as long as you've got good, clear boundaries up front
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.560]   and good, clear lines,
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.400]   I think it sounds like a great deal to me.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.680]   - Awesome, thanks so much for the advice.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.280]   - And with that, we wrap up today's Q&A show.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   Only two callers today.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.100]   I thought there would be more,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.420]   but we had a good conversation with those two callers.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.600]   Thank you all so much for being here,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.280]   for listening to today's show.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.580]   I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.880]   And I guess in closing, I would just say
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.580]   that if you are a parent,
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.280]   especially a parent of adult children,
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.600]   think very carefully about your relationship
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.640]   with your children,
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.560]   and think about how you can bless them.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.960]   And one important component of that is going to be
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.760]   can you bless them with respecting their independence
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.760]   and their autonomy?
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.880]   In my experience doing financial planning with people,
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.760]   I've seen wonderful situations
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.120]   and really catastrophic situations.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.380]   And the catastrophic situations do often involve
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:02.380]   excessive controllingness by parents of adult children.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.600]   And a lot of times the parents don't realize
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.440]   what they're doing.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.500]   They don't mean to make their children's lives difficult.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.240]   If my mom walks into my house,
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.340]   and if it was a family property and she said,
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.940]   oh, you took off the wallpaper.
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.100]   She doesn't mean to mean that as a negative comment,
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.560]   but a lot of times it does come across
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.260]   as that kind of negative comment.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.020]   And so one of the most valuable gifts
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.540]   you can give your children as they get older
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.700]   is simply respecting their autonomy, their independence,
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.420]   and respecting those boundary lines.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.500]   And then when you give a gift,
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.740]   it can be a really wonderful scenario.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.180]   But you know as well as I know, right?
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.180]   You give your 17 year old a car,
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.020]   but then you expect him to drive you everywhere.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.100]   Well, there's a degree to which maybe that's legitimate,
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.540]   but those kinds of fuzzy boundaries
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.060]   often make for a lot of tension in relationships.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.660]   And tension in relationships
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.220]   has a way of ruining finances over time.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.340]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
