[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380]   If you look at the nutritional density of the food we eat today compared to the density of food of hunter-gatherers,
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.660]   I just was in Africa and I was with the Hadza, which is one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes,
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.780]   and they're eating wild food all the time, 150 grams of fiber by all these roots and tubers.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.460]   Everything is extremely nutritionally dense. Wild food is way more nutritionally dense.
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.140]   They're running around naked in the sun, so they have no vitamin D deficiency, right?
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.220]   They have like loincloths on, and so the average person living in the modern world is typically nutritionally deficient,
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.660]   and the food we're eating is grown in soil that's been damaged because of industrial agricultural practices,
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.340]   or broccoli today has got 50% less nutrients than it did 50 years ago, so it's really tough.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.660]   If you go to Europe, if you go to other countries, the food is grown differently, it tastes differently,
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.460]   and taste always follows the nutritional density of the food.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.940]   I think we've grown foods for shelf stability, for transport, for storage, for appearance,
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.500]   but not for flavor and not for nutritional density.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.540]   I think everything we're eating today is so nutritionally depleted that we do need a multivitamin.
