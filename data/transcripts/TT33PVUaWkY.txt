[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   - Well, why do we thank anyone?
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.800]   It's a great question, really.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.600]   Candice writes in to ask it.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.960]   Here's her question.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.320]   Hello, Pastor John and Tony, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   It has been a great help to me.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.280]   And thanking you two plunges us right into my question.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.080]   How can we genuinely thank anyone but God?
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.120]   If God is sovereign over all things,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.800]   what role do people themselves play?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.360]   I just listened to APJ 1195,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   how does God's sovereignty not violate our decision-making?
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.560]   But as these truths are new to me,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.240]   I think I could really benefit from your answer
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000]   to this specific question.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.080]   If you go to a restaurant and are served by a waitress,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.800]   God gives the waitress all the abilities required
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440]   to do her job, the opportunity to do her job,
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.280]   maybe the willingness to do her work diligently
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.720]   in her very life and breath and existence.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.040]   Since she is working,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.600]   it seems right to thank her for her efforts,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840]   but since the Lord gives us everything,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920]   it seems right in another sense only to thank him.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880]   How, Pastor John, do you process this?
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   Well, I think this is a very good question,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.640]   even though some people probably will think
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.160]   it's totally unnecessary,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.960]   since a spirit of thanksgiving
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.240]   seems like such a healthy trait in a Christian soul.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.480]   Why would anybody ever question it?
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.120]   But one of the reasons why it's such a worthy question
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.600]   is because, now this is gonna surprise a lot of people,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   I'm not aware of any single place in the Bible at all
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.720]   where one human being explicitly thanks
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.000]   another human being for anything.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.240]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.640]   I mean, I could be wrong.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   So if our listeners find an exception to that,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.920]   they should write you.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.800]   Yep, yep, send us an email.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.280]   You can tell them, yeah,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.480]   and you can forward it to me if you think they're right.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   But that's where I am right now.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.560]   So when I hear this question, I say,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.440]   yeah, I've gotta come to terms with that.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   I know a very godly Christian scholar
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.960]   who sees that, what I just pointed out,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.400]   and he infers that that's his duty.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   He does not thank people for anything.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.600]   He thanks God for people, and he may tell them that.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.640]   So it may seem like an unwarranted question,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.520]   but really it's not.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.960]   Now, my own conviction and practice
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.160]   is to say thank you a lot.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.120]   I say thank you a lot to a lot of people,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.720]   or something like, I really appreciate that,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   or you have encouraged me so much, thank you.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.960]   Candace is asking the question like this.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.120]   Since God is the ultimate giver in the end,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.560]   through all things, in all things,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   why would it ever be appropriate to thank anyone but God?
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.320]   So Paul says, from him, through him, to him,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.040]   are all things to him be glory forever and ever,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.800]   Romans 11:36.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.280]   He says in Acts 17.25, God is not served by human hands
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.880]   as though he needed anything,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   because he himself gives life and breath and everything.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.640]   So if I'm served well at a restaurant,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.960]   God created the server, God gave the breath,
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.800]   God inclined the heart to courtesy,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.980]   God gave everything that makes my meal pleasant,
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.840]   so God, be thanked, not the waiter,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.440]   or the waitress, or the server.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.440]   And of course, that's true, God did give everything,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.440]   and God should be thanked.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.320]   In all of our thankfulness,
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.520]   we should have God ultimately in mind
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.120]   as the giver and sustainer and the providential guide
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.600]   in every good that happens to us,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.240]   indeed, every bad thing that happens to us,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.520]   which God turns for good if we're Christians,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   which is why Paul says, by the way,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   give thanks in all circumstances, 1 Thessalonians 5.18,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.520]   and give thanks for all things, Ephesians 5.20.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.700]   But here's why I don't think any of those truths
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.800]   means we should not thank other people for benefits
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.640]   which we receive through their hands.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   I think we all would agree that human beings
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   become instruments in the hands of God
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.800]   for doing many good things that God wants done.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.840]   So for example, Jesus says about Paul
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.440]   when he commissioned him,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.080]   he is a chosen instrument of mine
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   to carry my name before the Gentiles,
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.800]   and the kings, and the children of Israel.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.040]   That's Acts 9.15.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.600]   And then he says to Paul,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.840]   I am sending you to open their eyes.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.440]   I'm sending you, you, to open their eyes
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.840]   so that they may turn from darkness to light
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.740]   and from the power of Satan to God,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.680]   that they may receive forgiveness of sins.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.540]   That's Acts 26.18.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.060]   And of course, this is the way God has worked
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.040]   ever since the beginning.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.480]   He gives commandments, he gives promises,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.960]   he gives warnings, he gives help.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.240]   But there is no doubt that human beings
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.960]   are God's primary created instrument
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.200]   for accomplishing in the world what he wants done.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.240]   So the question becomes,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.540]   how does God think about our instrumentality?
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.540]   What status does the instrument itself, us,
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.820]   have in God's hands?
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.380]   Can the instrument in God's hands be called good,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.380]   or praiseworthy, or faithful, or obedient, or pleasing?
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.620]   Does God view the instruments in his hands
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.000]   as proper recipients of his rewards,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.100]   his commendation, his praise?
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.500]   And if God does view the instruments in his hands
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.860]   as fitting recipients of his own commendation
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.360]   and rewards and praise, then what should our attitude
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.260]   and response towards those human instruments be?
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.220]   Well, the Bible is very clear
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.340]   that God is the rewarder of those who seek him.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.820]   Several times Jesus said that the Father will reward us
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.620]   for acting certain ways, Matthew 6.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.700]   Great will be your reward in heaven
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.500]   for enduring persecution, Matthew 5.12.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.900]   Time after time we are told God rewards us
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.220]   for the good that we do, Ephesians 6.8.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.580]   Amazing statement.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.540]   Whatever good anyone does,
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.220]   this he will receive back from the Lord.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.380]   Wow.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.260]   And even more than reward,
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.500]   Paul says that we'll all receive our commendation,
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.460]   and literally the word is praise from God.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.860]   That's just almost unfathomable.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.660]   C.S. Lewis calls it the weight of glory
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.980]   that we would ever hear, well done, well done.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.660]   How could God speak such a thing to a worm like me, right?
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.900]   So even though everything good that we do
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.900]   is enabled by God, it is sustained by God,
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.100]   it is made useful by God,
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.860]   nevertheless, God has graciously chosen
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.100]   to look upon obedient instruments in his hands
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.980]   as pleasing to him and fitting recipients
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.860]   of his rewards and commendation.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.540]   So my heart inclination is to say
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.620]   if God Almighty, in infinite perfection
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.140]   and having no need whatsoever,
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.060]   can look with favor and reward and commendation
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.540]   and praise upon the imperfect work of his people,
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.180]   might it not be fitting that I would look upon
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.860]   human instruments in his hand
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.860]   with a humble sense of expressed, glad indebtedness?
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.220]   And that would be my definition of thankfulness,
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.220]   expressed, glad indebtedness
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.220]   to them for their instrumentality
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.100]   in mediating to me good from God.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.900]   God should always be, in my mind, the ultimate giver,
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.580]   and he gets thanks in everything, for everything,
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.540]   but the role of instruments in his hands is an amazing role,
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.540]   and I am put in debt to that instrument as well as to God.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.860]   If something good happens to me
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.980]   because of another person's instrumentality
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.660]   in the hand of God, I am glad,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:37.780]   and the mixture of gladness and a sense of indebtedness
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.780]   is what I call thankfulness.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.580]   It belongs ultimately to God continually,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.580]   and I think it is fitting that this gladness find expression
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.140]   toward the morally responsible human instruments
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.060]   in God's hands as well.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.780]   In a sense, an expression of thankfulness
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.980]   is simply an expression of humility.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.740]   It says, "I have become your debtor,
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.440]   and I don't resent it as though you made me a welfare case.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.300]   I receive it, and I am glad for it,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.580]   and I want you to know that my gladness
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.540]   is owing in part to you and what you've done."
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.300]   So, in conclusion, I would say,
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.660]   as long as we are not detracting from God
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.740]   and we're acknowledging him behind
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.500]   and in everything that comes to us,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.820]   then thanking other people for the benefits they give us
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.820]   is a fitting, humble expression of our glad indebtedness.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.660]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.580]   And that mention of Acts 26, verses 17 to 18
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.060]   that you just made is quite a startling text
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.540]   to meditate on in this line of thinking.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.900]   The resurrected Christ appeared to Paul
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.740]   and commissioned him to the Gentiles
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.940]   in order to open the eyes of unbelievers to the gospel.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.560]   It's a stunning commission,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.360]   and one we've talked about on this podcast
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   in ABJ episodes 841, 1209, and 1344.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.780]   It's stunning, episodes 841, 1209, and 1344,
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.780]   if you want to dwell on that text more fully.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.740]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.340]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.020]   search our growing archive and find those episodes,
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.220]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.180]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.440]   Well, why did God need part of Adam to make Eve
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.860]   when he made Adam from dust?
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.180]   It's a Bible question from a female listener to the podcast,
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.580]   another really good one from you,
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.260]   and it's up next time.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.300]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.120]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.180]   Have a great weekend,
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.700]   and keep sending in those great Bible questions.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.740]   We'll see you Monday.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
