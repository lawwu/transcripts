[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.400]   Happy Friday. Today we are taking up the topic of physical appearance because, well, because the Bible speaks often about physical appearance.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.000]   Scripture contains dozens of references to physical looks, both to attractiveness and unattractiveness.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500]   Those categories emerge all over the Bible, so there's no need to shy away from this topic.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.000]   And we looked at many of those texts when we addressed this topic six years ago back in APJ 1699.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And since listening to that episode, which became pretty popular, we've gotten several follow-up questions, including this one from a listener named Sean.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for APJ 1699, 'Why did God make me unattractive?' That episode was excellent.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I wonder, though, if you could expand on your last paragraph about the beauty of Christ satisfying us despite the pain of rejection.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   In my younger days, I often lamented that I was not better looking, but now I realize that I would have ruined my life several times over chasing relationships with ungodly women.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I now see my average attractiveness as a massive spiritual blessing, which protected me from idols and which drove me deeper into Christ instead of into shallow patterns of life.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I would not trade that joy for attractiveness in a million years."
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Yeah, just hearing you articulate the question again reminds me of how many pimples I had when I was 14 and 15,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and how nervous I was around people and how so bad I wanted it to be otherwise.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And now I share that same amazement. I think God spared me a lot of junk by not letting me get on the fast track to trouble.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Well, anyway, that was a beautiful testimony. I love his testimony.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And I use the word beautiful when I say it's a beautiful testimony. I use the word beautiful intentionally.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That's what we're talking about here, beauty.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I would rather hear a person say that from the heart than gaze on the most beautiful woman in the world or on the most beautiful mountain or lake.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Natural beauties, yes, they're good. They're not evil. They're a gift.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We should receive them and see something of God in them.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Everything good is a partial revelation of the all-satisfying God.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But the beauty of soul, a mind and a heart, a beautiful mind that in much affliction or disappointment finds Jesus to be satisfying,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   that is a beauty of another kind and a higher level. And I love to see it.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So just hearing this question was a great joy to me. It was beautiful.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So Sean wants me to expand on the beauty of Christ satisfying us despite the pain of rejection.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I think what might be helpful is to ponder four changes that need to happen in our minds and hearts in order to find lasting satisfaction in the beauty of Christ.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'll name them and then just say a word about each one.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   One, we need to shift our focus from the beauty of the body to the beauty of character.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Two, we need to shift our focus from the beauty that satisfies the body to the beauty that satisfies the soul.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Three, we need to shift our focus from beauty as the world sees it to beauty as God sees it.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And finally, we need to shift our focus from beauty in time to beauty in eternity.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So number one, we need to shift our focus from the beauty of body to the beauty of character.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   The most graphic illustration of the need for this shift is the appearance of Jesus in the hour of his most beautiful act, Isaiah 52, 14.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And 53, 3.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   His appearance was so marred beyond human semblance and his form beyond that of the children of mankind.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He had no form or majesty that we should look at him and no beauty that we should desire him.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   In other words, he not only became sin for us, he became ugly for us.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The ugliness of sin was accompanied by the ugliness of body.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So ugly in his torments, it was hard to look at him.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And yet, at this good news-creating moment, he was in another sense more beautiful than at any other time.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   God, give us eyes.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I think that's what Paul would say.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Give us eyes.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   If we have eyes to see.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But Paul put it like this.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The light of the gospel of the glory that is the beauty of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's what we'll see according to 2 Corinthians 4.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Verse 4.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The good news is the beauty of Christ at the moment of his greatest ugliness.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   That's the shift of focus we need.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   From the beauty of body to the beauty of Christ, Christ's character, Christ's love.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So it's not surprising when Paul speaks to the beauty of Christian women, for example, with just this emphasis.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   He says in 1 Peter 3, 3, "Do not let your adorning be external, the braiding of hair, the putting on of gold jewelry, the clothing that you wear.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty, the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now, he's not saying women shouldn't wear clothes.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's ridiculous.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I mean, he's not saying, "Oh, don't wear clothes."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And he's not even saying they shouldn't be attractive.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   He's saying all of us, men and women, need a deep shift of focus from beauty of body to beauty of character.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Without that, all our talk about the beauty of Christ will be shallow.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Number 2.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We need to shift our focus from the beauty that satisfies the body to the beauty that satisfies the soul.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Now, the point here is not about the beauty we seek to have in ourselves, but the beauty we seek to enjoy in others.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   This requires a profound change of heart by the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It comes naturally to us to enjoy good looks in the opposite sex or beautiful scenery.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And there is enough of the image of God left in us that most fallen people can even admire and enjoy a beautiful act of sacrificial love and call it beautiful.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   They see something beautiful in sacrifice and love, and they say, "That's beautiful."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   But it requires a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit to see God in Christ as supremely beautiful and therefore satisfying.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   This is a new kind of satisfaction.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It's not bodily.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's not the satisfaction merely of the eyes.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It is spiritual.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The psalmist doesn't have it by nature.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's why he prays for it.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   He says, "Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   This is what God has to do.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   God has to satisfy us with God, Psalm 90, verse 14, or Psalm 17, 15.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "When I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness."
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Or Psalm 63, 5, "My soul will be satisfied as with rich food when I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you in the watches of the night."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   To shift our focus from beauty that satisfies the body to beauty that satisfies the soul, we must know God.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Really know him.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Know him until he becomes the source of all beauty and the sum of all beauty for us.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And then we will be able to taste and see the beauty of Christ.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Third, we need to shift our focus from beauty as the world sees it to beauty as God sees it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   We live in a time when TV and streaming services and Facebook and TikTok and Instagram and Twitter and texting and FaceTime and a camera in every pocket
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   continually throws into our faces the issue of looks, looks, looks.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   The appeal is constantly to the immediate response of our eyes.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And it is almost all outward.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Visual appearance and its immediate impact is held up as desirable.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   But the deeper issues of character are not.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Why?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Well, because it's artistically harder to depict character.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   The appeal of character is it's not instantaneous.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Most people don't even have a clear sense of what character is.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So the default is feed the eyes, feed the eyes, feed the eyes, feed the visual instincts.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Especially of the men.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Maybe not especially of the men.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I don't know what's going on in the minds of women.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I'm not a woman.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I'm a man.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I know what they're doing to me.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But 1 Samuel 16, 7 says, "The Lord sees not as man sees.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart."
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   We need to shift our focus from the beauty as the world sees it and shows it to the beauty as God sees it and creates it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   This will probably require a significant shift in the viewing habits of many Christians.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Finally, number four, we need to shift our focus from beauty in time to beauty in eternity.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   If God created us with a homely exterior, we're just not handsome or pretty.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   If God created us with a homely exterior, and in a world like ours, life has been harder because of it,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   then we need to shift our focus and realize that this light, momentary homeliness,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   which we call a lifetime, is nothing compared to the eternity of beauty we will enjoy.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   "Beloved," this is 1 John 3, "Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is,"
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   which means at least, Jesus says, that we will shine like the sun in the kingdom of our Father, Matthew 13, 43.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So finally, the beauty of Christ will not only be what we see, but what we are, and we will be supremely satisfied in him.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Yes, a beautiful testimony from Sean and a wonderful word here on the beauty of Christ at the moment of his greatest ugliness.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   A profound, powerful word, Pastor John. Thank you for pointing us back to the gospel again.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And thank you for joining us today. Again, this episode was a follow-up to APJ 1699,

[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I am your host, Tony Reinke. Have a wonderful weekend worshiping with the people of God,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and we will see you back here next week.
