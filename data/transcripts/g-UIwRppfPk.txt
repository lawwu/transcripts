[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We'll ask three people to explain what it means to be spiritual, and you'll get four different answers.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   That's a humorous way to state the problem.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Definitions of spirituality are very squishy things.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The term means something different to everyone.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   So what is biblical spirituality?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And can we settle on an objective definition of spirituality from the Bible?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   That's the question today from a young woman, and for her it's not a theoretical question at all.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "Pastor John, my mother and I have differing views on biblical spirituality,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   so much so that she has said that my husband and I are not spiritual.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I believe this is because she embraces spirituality as spiritual gifts,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   such as speaking in tongues, interpreting dreams, and claiming healing.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   My husband and I have worked in the mission field, are heavily involved in church,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   love the Lord, and seek after Him in all things.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I don't know what to say to this.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Is it possible that we, my husband and I, are not spiritual?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I feel that this is not the case, as I see the fruit of the Spirit in our lives."
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   How would you respond to such a statement toward yourself,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and more broadly, what does authentic Christian spirituality look like?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Let's start with a few comments about the use of language and the importance of definitions.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And then we'll move over to the biblical use of the term "spiritual,"
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   which is especially interesting because in the ESV, the word "spiritual" or "spiritually"
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   occurs 29 times, and 27 of them are in the writings of the apostle Paul,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   and the other two are in Peter's first letter.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So it isn't a very widespread term, and we're mainly dealing with Paul,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   we're dealing with his understanding of it, when we talk about the meaning of spirituality
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   or being spiritual in the New Testament.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So first, a few thoughts about the use of language.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I wonder what our friend would feel or think if a New Age spiritualist
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   who practices divination and fortune-telling and necromancy and palm-reading and earth worship
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   were to say to her, to our mature Christian friend,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   "You're not spiritual because you don't pursue these spiritual practices like I do."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Now, my guess is that our friend would not feel very threatened at all
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   or seriously criticized because she knows that those practices
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   are not at all what the Bible means by "spiritual."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   In fact, just the opposite. The Bible opposes those practices.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   But the point is that the New Age spiritualist is spiritual by his own definition.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So there would be no point in arguing which of those is spiritual.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   If you don't define your terms, it would go nowhere.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The argument would go nowhere if you said, "Which one of us is spiritual?"
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Because they don't agree on what they mean by "spiritual."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   They are using the word in drastically different ways.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So when our friend says, "My mother and I have differing views on biblical spirituality,"
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   she could mean, "My mother and I agree on the meaning of the word,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   but we disagree on whether my husband and I are living up to it."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Or she could mean that they seriously disagree on the biblical definition of spirituality,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and so they can't assess the other with the same criteria,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and we just talk past each other.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Now, I'm pretty sure from what she says that our friend takes the latter view,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   because she says she embraces spirituality as spiritual gifts,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   such as speaking in tongues, interpreting dreams, claiming healing.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So the mother thinks that being spiritual in a biblical sense is exercising spiritual gifts,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   while our friend thinks being spiritual means something else.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So let's go to Paul, Paul's writings, and see what the term actually means.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So Paul uses the word "spiritual" to refer to spiritual wisdom, spiritual blessings,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   spiritual songs, spiritual bodies, spiritual gifts, spiritual rock, spiritual food.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Now, we're going to leave all that aside.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We're only going to talk about spiritual people.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I think he uses the term in three ways, but they are all rooted in the same basic idea,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and I think that basic idea is that a person is spiritual
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   if by the power of the Holy Spirit, he has experienced a new birth
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and is no longer defined by the flesh, which opposes God,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   but is defined by the Holy Spirit, who causes him to trust God and love God.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So a spiritual person is most fundamentally a supernaturally transformed person
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   who has been transferred by the Spirit from the natural condition of unbelief
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   to the Spirit-created condition of new creature in Christ.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   They are spiritual in the sense that they were created by the Holy Spirit
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and are indwelt and formed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So you can see that if I'm right, Paul's use of the term "spiritual" gets its meaning
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   mainly from God's Spirit, not my spirit.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Paul doesn't call somebody spiritual because their spirit is especially active
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   or because they have an unusual preoccupation with mystical things, spiritual things.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Now, the most important text for seeing these things is 1 Corinthians 2, verses 12 and following.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So let me read a couple of verses.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   "Now we have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   that we might understand things freely given to us by God;
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   and we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Now, who are they? Those who are spiritual.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   So we've received the Spirit.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   We're imparting things from the Spirit by words taught by the Spirit,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   but we can only do that to those who are spiritual.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Who are they? That's what Paul turns to.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   They're the only ones to whom Paul can successfully transmit spiritual truths.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So Paul explains why that is and who they are in verse 13, the next verse.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "The natural person," now that's the unregenerate, unsaved person
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   without the Holy Spirit, "contrasted with the spiritual person."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   for they are folly to him, and he's not able to understand them
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   because they are spiritually assessed.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Spiritually assessed.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   That is, in the sense that the indwelling Holy Spirit
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   enables a person to assess them rightly.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   They're not foolishness, but they're true and beautiful.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Then he goes on, verse 15.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   "The spiritual person," now he's contrasting that with the natural person,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   the unregenerate person.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "The spiritual person assesses all things, but is himself assessed by no one,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   for who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?"
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   But we have the mind of Christ.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   That is, we have the Holy Spirit shaping the way our mind assesses things
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   so that we don't call wisdom stupid or foolishness.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Instead, we assess things in the true light of Christ.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But natural people can't make that act.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   They can't do that because it's not real to them.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's just foolishness to them.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   So my conclusion from this passage is that Paul's most basic use of the term
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "spiritual" is to refer to true Christians who have the Holy Spirit
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and therefore are no longer merely natural people,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   but supernatural people who have been born again by the Spirit
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and whose minds are therefore able to see in the gospel the beauty of Christ
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and the wisdom of God.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So all true Christians are spiritual in that fundamental sense,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and that's his most basic sense.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Now, I think there are two other uses of the term in Paul,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and both of them are adaptations of this meaning, not contradictions of it.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So the first is that Paul can use the term "spiritual" for Christians
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   who are more mature in their experience of this newness of their spirituality.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   1 Corinthians 3, verse 1.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   "But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people,"
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   which is different than saying that they're not spiritual people.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "I couldn't address you as spiritual people, but as infants in Christ."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Now, I don't think that means--I used to think this,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   but I don't think that means that they're not spiritual in the first sense,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   but they weren't acting like it.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Strife and jealousy was all over the church,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and so Paul treats them as babies.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Here's another example of this use of the more mature Christian
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   as spiritual in Galatians 6, verse 1.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   "Brothers, if anyone is caught in a transgression,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   you who are spiritual should restore him."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Now, he's a Christian, and yet he's calling these folks spiritual
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   to go restore him in the spirit of gentleness.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Those who are walking in the more mature influence of the Spirit,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   the Spirit's fruit, like meekness he refers to,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   you go restore that one back.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   That's my second use of the word,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   a more mature experience of that spirituality.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   The other use of the term "spiritual" is ironic in 1 Corinthians 14, 37.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It goes like this.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   "If anyone thinks that he's a prophet or spiritual,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   are a command of the Lord."
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   So ironically, there are those who have spiritual gifts,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   and they really do.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Like, I think, our friend's mother is thinking.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   They have spiritual gifts, and they claim, therefore,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   to be spiritual.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   But Paul says, "Now, here's the real test,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   you people who are speaking in tongues
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   and experiencing healings and exorcisms.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Here's the real test of being spiritual.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It's not gifts, but submission to the apostolic word.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Do you acknowledge that our word is from the Lord?"
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So my counsel to our friend who sent this question
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   is that she will, with all humility,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   in the pursuit of all the fruit of the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   not be shamed by her mother's misunderstanding.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Don't let her words shame you.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   She should realize that having spiritual gifts
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   does not make a person spiritual.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   That was the problem at Corinth.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It's having the Holy Spirit that makes one spiritual,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and being formed into the image of Christ by His fruit,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   that's mature spirituality.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that definition.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And that mention of 1 Corinthians 14, 37 here in this episode
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   reminds me of one of my all-time favorite APJ episodes.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   We titled it, "Should We Listen for the Audible Voice of God?"
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Should We Listen for the Audible Voice of God?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   That's APJ 167, an oldie, but a classic,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   to me at least, when I found helpful.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   1 Corinthians 14, 37 pops up there too in that episode.
