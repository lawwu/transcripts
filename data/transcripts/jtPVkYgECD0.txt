[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   Elite status with airlines and hotels. Who needs it, right? Well, six months ago,
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.340]   I would have said not me. But somehow, heading into 2025, I've racked up status on four airlines
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.520]   and four hotel groups. In this episode, I break down exactly how it happened,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.720]   the unexpected perks, and whether chasing status is actually worth it. Plus,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.620]   I'm sharing some incredible listener wins, the biggest loyalty program devaluations you should
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.080]   know about, and my new approach to actually using points instead of just collecting them.

[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.480]   Okay, so in episode 182, I went over almost a dozen different ways that you can fast track your way
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.980]   to elite status. But I actually remember saying that I didn't care about elite status that much
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.400]   because I don't travel that much, and we had so many points and miles saved up that we often use
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.500]   them to fly in premium cabins, business class, first class. And that gives us a lot of the features
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.380]   we would get with status. And so if you asked me on the street six, seven months ago and said,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.500]   Oh, how do you feel about elite status? I would say, it doesn't really matter. I'm not focused on it.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.060]   Well, I found that funny because I started looking at where I ended up for 2025. And it completely
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.620]   contradicts that thought. I looked and I ended up having status on four different airlines and four
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.760]   different hotel groups. And I want to talk about how that happened, what it means for the future and
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.180]   how it might impact your life. And I also want to share a few amazing takeaways I've gotten from
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.620]   listeners that you've all sent in, as well as some of the interesting things that are happening in the
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.400]   world of travel points, miles, cards, some of what we've been sending out lately, and some of the
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.520]   things I've been doing about it. So let's jump straight into airline status. And I'll talk a little
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.360]   bit about what's going on. So first off Southwest, I don't think I have ever actually had Southwest
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.620]   status. I've gone for companion pass. But for those who aren't familiar, companion pass actually
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.600]   is separate from their status, you can earn companion pass just by spending on a credit card,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920]   get a free companion you can add. It's an awesome deal. We've done it multiple times,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.340]   highly recommend if you're traveling a lot with the same person to places Southwest flies.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.840]   However, the points you earn to get companion pass are different than the tier qualifying points you
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.560]   earn for status. And I rarely fly Southwest enough and on expensive enough tickets to earn anywhere close
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.920]   to what you need for A-list. However, there was this promo last year that I caught wind of in a Facebook
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.140]   group about Southwest, where transferred points from hotel groups were actually counting as tier points.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.340]   And there was a separate promo where credit card spend was almost earning twice as many tier
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.040]   points as normal. Now, this was a really tight window from when I learned about it. Unfortunately,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.020]   it never made it to the podcast because it was such a narrow window to act. I did share it with the
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.380]   membership. So something worth taking a look at if you want to get alerted when I find these wild
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.220]   things. But what happened was I transferred points from Marriott to Southwest and from Choice Hotels to
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.480]   Southwest. And those cleared as tier points. And so very quickly, I was on my way to A-list. And then I have
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.280]   a Southwest credit card and I spent a little extra on that than I normally would. And by the end of last
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.200]   year, I found my way to A-list. Now, why did I even do this? Well, the primary reason I did it was because
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.440]   Southwest had already announced that they were making a bunch of changes coming up this year. And one of
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.100]   them was that there was going to be seat selection, including extra legroom and preferred seats. And that
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.620]   was the main big change they were going to do. There was no more pick your own seat. Boarding
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.380]   isn't going to operate how it used to be. And I thought, gosh, if I have this limited opportunity
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.460]   to get Southwest A-list, maybe when they make that change, I'll be able to pick seats and board and do
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.760]   all these things that I wouldn't otherwise be able to do. Now, I didn't know how much Southwest would end
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.240]   up changing between that point in time and this year. And specifically in the last week, for anyone who
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.520]   hasn't seen, Southwest has basically gone the way of every other airline and almost feels like it'll
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.040]   be indistinguishable from other airlines because all of the things that Southwest used to do that
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.840]   made them so Southwest are either things that other airlines have already started doing or that they've
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.440]   gotten rid of. So going forward, and I can't remember the exact start date. Some of these are flights
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.600]   booked after May 28th, 2025, but no free checked bags. There's one advantage to this, which I didn't
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.260]   realize, which is that you have to pay these airline taxes and fees when you sell tickets.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.900]   And even if bag fees are part of those tickets, you have to pay those taxes. When you unbundle those,
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.500]   you don't have to pay all those taxes on the bag fees. So there is some rational economic argument to
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.480]   do that. You will going forward still get two bags with A-list preferred and one with A-list or a credit
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.380]   card. A Southwest card is an easy way to avoid that. They're going to add basic economy. They've already
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.080]   really slashed the earnings of their most inexpensive fare class in terms of number of points
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   you'll earn. Flight credits you get from canceled reservations or refunded flights are only going to last
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.900]   one year or even six months with those fares. And so lots of changes. So having A-list will actually avoid a lot of
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.460]   these. You'll get to pick seats, change your flights, early boarding, free checked bags and all that stuff. So I'm actually
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.980]   really happy that I ended up with this status this year because once these changes go into effect,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.800]   this will add some value and who knows where we'll be traveling on Southwest later.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.040]   That said, it's kind of what made Southwest. And now Southwest just feels like every other airline.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.160]   Every other airline now made all of their flights cancelable and refundable into credit
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.700]   that last one year. All the other airlines have no free checked bags unless you have a credit card
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.180]   status and they have basic economy and all these seat rules. So not sure what would make Southwest
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.820]   any different or preferable other than maybe a slight preference for less mechanical issues because
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.520]   they seem to only operate one or two airline types. So I know that is one of the reasons they've done
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.180]   that. But for the most part, sometimes if we're going on a trip during ski season, we think Southwest's
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.580]   great. We get all these free checked bags and we're going to be needing them. Going forward,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.000]   that's just not going to be the case. So a little bit of a segue, but that was how I ended up with
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.680]   Southwest A-list status this year. I also ended up with United Silver. And based in the Bay Area,
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.280]   United is probably the best airline for coverage in terms of direct flights from SFO. And I don't know
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.240]   how it happened because I don't fly that much, but I just barely made it into enough premier qualifying
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.340]   points to end up with silver, which is their lowest tier of status, gets you almost no benefits other
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.300]   than a checked bag. And you can pick preferred seats. You can't even pick economy plus seats with
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.780]   extra leg room until 24 hours before departure, at which point they are almost always taken or only
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.800]   middle seats left. And so I think the reason I got there was that I was right towards the end of the
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.860]   year. And I was close enough that if I paid, it was like $150 to upgrade a flight from economy to
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.080]   business for a flight where business meant nothing, like flying down to Los Angeles from San Francisco,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.100]   but that pushed me over the edge. And I figured depending on how much we fly United this year
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.140]   and whether we're checking bags and traveling as a family and wanting to pick good seats, probably worth
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.980]   it for a couple hundred dollars, especially when that hundred dollars comes with some benefit
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.920]   and additional miles crude. So probably $80 or something. And now, sure enough, we are flying
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.960]   United in the near future and we'll be checking a few bags and that will probably have ended up saving
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.600]   us more money than it cost. Next, I ended up with Delta status. Shout out to Josh, who I met on our
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.080]   Iceland trip. He was trying to strategize his way to get to Diamond on Delta. And I spent a lot of time
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.760]   brainstorming some ideas and giving him some tools that he could probably use to make that happen.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.940]   And as a thank you, which was not necessary at all, he used one of his Delta medallion benefits
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.480]   from hitting Diamond to gift me gold status. And so I'm going to do my best to put that to good work.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.940]   I mentioned Josh, who I met on Iceland. We met so many awesome people on Iceland that I'm sure I will
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.700]   be friends with for a very long time. If you want to go on a trip and meet interesting people that are
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:19.100]   also listeners of this show, highly recommend checking it out. We have, I think, two or three spots left on the
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.400]   second Iceland trip this year, leaving September 28th. So you can go to all the hacks.com slash
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.280]   Iceland. If you want to have an experience like that, it was absolutely incredible. One of the best
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:34.620]   trips I've ever taken. Then next there was Alaska MVP. Now I did a status match from built and that
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.980]   expired in January. So I went into the year with that status. But if you asked me a couple of weeks
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.520]   ago, I would have said, didn't matter. I don't really fly Alaska a lot. And then somehow just in the
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.680]   first two and a half months of the year, almost every trip I've needed to take, I've been on Alaska
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:57.220]   and I'm already halfway back to MVP status on Alaska. And so just to make sure that I had enough points
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.920]   to get there, because for whatever reason, it seems like I'm flying Alaska a lot. And I already have some
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.320]   flights in later in the year on Alaska. I ended up picking up the Alaska business card, not only because
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:14.040]   it had a great signup bonus of 75,000 points, you get a companion fare. So for $99, I think you get
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:20.640]   a buy one, get one. But you can earn up to 30,000 elite qualifying miles with spend. So that'll make
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.780]   sure that I get over the hurdle to get back to MVP, maybe even MVP gold, which based on how much I'm
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:33.040]   flying Alaska might actually be the primary airline I fly over United. Built also has a promo that I didn't
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.260]   realize was recurring, where you can status match to Air France and get gold status there. I thought
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.460]   it was a one time thing. But the more I read about it, it seems like you can do it every single year.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.420]   But until I book a flight on Air France, it doesn't seem like there's any benefit to doing this,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.480]   especially if I have Delta status, you know, the Sky Team status from Air France wouldn't matter
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.120]   either. Funny enough, the one airline that I probably haven't flown in the last five years,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.900]   which is American, and obviously, there's plenty of airlines around the world that I haven't flown,
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.880]   but the one US based mainstream airline that I haven't flown is the one I'm most intrigued about
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.200]   trying to earn their status. And for people who don't know, American implemented this loyalty point
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.760]   system where you can earn almost every tier of their status except for their kind of coveted hidden
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.780]   invite only concierge key just by spending on a credit card, or earning points from shopping portals,
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.460]   booking hotels, all that stuff. You don't actually have to fly the airline at all. And I thought going into
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.200]   the year once I was booking these Alaska flights that it might be the right path because almost
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.280]   every benefit of Alaska elite status is also given to people with American elite status.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.460]   And so I ended up also getting the American business card this year, they do have this really interesting
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.920]   promo going on this year, where best I understand, at least on the business card, when you add an
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:57.080]   authorized employee card, whoever the employee is earns loyalty points, and the main cardholder does.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:03.540]   So if I were to use that card and try to earn loyalty points, using an employee card for my wife, we would
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:09.380]   both end up with American status. There are milestone rewards along the way. So we both get those milestone
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.400]   rewards. For some reason, that makes no sense to me. And I'm going to come back to this at the end of talking about
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.580]   all these statuses. I want to do this. I don't fly American, their route network from the Bay Area is pretty
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:25.820]   terrible. The only place I've ever considered flying them is to Los Angeles, where every time I've done that five,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.560]   six years ago, it seems like you always land at a remote terminal that you need to take a bus to, which is the most
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:38.200]   inconvenient thing. It's certainly not fast. And so I have no idea why I'm interested in this. But it does seem a little bit like a
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.500]   game, right? Going down the path of Oh, what kinds of things can I do to earn extra loyalty points? I signed up for this
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.680]   newsletter called loyalty point hunters. And so I get these like, Oh, here's this offer where you buy a meal kit. And the discount
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.260]   basically makes it $5. But you get 1000s of loyalty points. And a part of me just really wants to play
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.860]   this game. And then a part of me thinks it's absolutely crazy, because I never fly American. So
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.200]   I'm going to address my own problems after I run through this inventory. But I figured it's kind of
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.360]   helpful to hear where all these statuses came from how I ended up with them. Because they do provide a ton
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.160]   of benefit when you have a lot of statuses, you're boarding early, you're earning more points,
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.880]   you're not paying for check bags, all kinds of things like that. I am happy I have them. I just
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.480]   think to some extent, it's a little crazy, given that we're not flying that often. On the flip side,
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.920]   I really love it. And it's kind of a game. So if I treat it from that perspective, then it's really
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.480]   interesting. This episode is brought to you by thrive market. You know, that feeling when you're standing
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.920]   in the grocery store staring at labels trying to figure out what's actually healthy, but that ingredient
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:46.000]   list is so confusing. With two young kids, we are constantly trying to make sure the whole family
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.040]   eats clean, healthy food, but it can be a lot of work to make that happen. And that's why I love
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.720]   thrive market. They're my go to online grocery store for getting healthy essentials delivered straight to
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.360]   our door without ever having to leave the house. Unfortunately, there are over 10,000 food additives
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.440]   allowed in the US, and it's hard to know what's actually safe. So I love that thrive market bans over
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.000]   1000 harmful ingredients. Their team does all the hard work and make sure every product meets high
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.240]   quality, clean standards. For example, one product we love from thrive is simple mills. We feel so good

[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:08.800]   hotels, I'll start with Marriott because one of the perks of hitting Marriott Titanium, which requires
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.560]   75 nights, is that you actually get United Silver status. So one of the things I was thinking about
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   last year was, gosh, if we fly United enough that it would be valuable to pick the right seats, get
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.600]   free check bags, all those kinds of things. Should I just get it by trying to do more Marriott nights or
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.120]   should I get it by going for United status itself? Because it's not reciprocal the other way. I don't
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.420]   think United Silver gets you anything meaningful on Marriott. I do think if you earned high enough
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:41.240]   United status, you would, but I certainly haven't. To do that, though, you need to spend 75 nights in
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:48.680]   Marriott, which I probably spent nowhere near 75. However, with the right set of Marriott cards,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.960]   you get a huge head start. So most of the consumer cards give you 15 nights towards your status.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.540]   And then on top of that, if you get the Bonvoy Brilliant card, that gets you 25 nights. And then
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:05.980]   the business cards will also get you 15 nights. So if you have both, you can get 15 nights. And if one
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.300]   of your consumer cards is the Brilliant card, then you get 40 nights. The funny thing is, though, if you're
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.680]   really chasing that status, that Brilliant card also comes with Platinum status, which I think is the
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.580]   most important status for Marriott stays because it gets you the free breakfast, the upgrades and late
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.760]   checkout and all those things. Do you have a higher priority on those upgrades with higher status? Yes.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   But it clears the hurdle of I'm staying at a resort, I want the free breakfast, I want a lot of those
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.780]   perks. And so you just get that with the card. So if you're someone who cares about Marriott status,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.440]   that card will just get it to you. You don't have to worry about anything. The other thing that's
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.800]   interesting is Marriott does have this lifetime status program. And I'm at the point going into this
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.040]   year, I had eight years of being Platinum. Last year, I didn't have it. So I ended up opening up the
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.420]   Brilliant card, because that would clock me in at Platinum status for 2024. I would have it also in
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:05.240]   2025. So that would take me to nine. And next year will take me to 10. And so by holding that card for
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.780]   what will end up being about 15 months, that should put me over the threshold to have Platinum on Marriott
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.860]   for the rest of my life. And I will never have to hold a card or think about status at all. So I'm
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:21.080]   really excited about that. Now, does it make sense to push for titanium on Marriott or,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.980]   you know, silver on United? I'm not sure. I still have to think about that. Because I'm starting out
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.660]   with 40 nights, that still is 25 nights in a Marriott, which is a lot of nights. There is one
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.280]   credit card, I can't remember the name of it. It's a chase one that lets you earn elite nights by spending,
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.120]   but it is almost prohibitively expensive. That's something I'm thinking about. But
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:46.840]   Marriott is a program where recent devaluations, which I'll talk about in a bit, have just made it
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.300]   a little tricky to be really loved. In fact, in the points and miles world, anytime a loyalty program
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.920]   does something that people don't like, the term that I've now heard everyone using is that they've
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.080]   gotten bond void. Because Marriott just continues to make things difficult for everyone. There's
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.640]   literally a matrix that I'll link to in the show notes that you need to follow to try to figure out
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.440]   whether you're actually going to get a free breakfast based on how you booked your reservation,
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.020]   where you're staying, what chain, etc. They don't make things simple or straightforward
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.980]   whatsoever. So that's Marriott. Where I actually switched all my loyalty this year to was Hyatt.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:28.760]   So last year, going into the year, I thought, this status of Hyatt seems to be the thing everyone
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.760]   in the points and miles world loves. I've never had Hyatt status. I rarely had ever stayed at a Hyatt
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.440]   hotel. And it was very hard to get. And so the reason why most people seem to love this status is
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.200]   because you really get treated like an elite member of their loyalty program, because it's a lot harder
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.040]   to get. Marriott, you can get, you know, platinum status with a credit card. Hilton, you can get
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.560]   diamond status, their top tier with a credit card. I think IHG, you can also do that. So if you want to
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.380]   get top tier status on Hyatt, it is way harder. You need to spend 60 nights in a Hyatt, or you need to
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:07.580]   augment those 60 nights by spending a ton of money on one of their credit cards. And each one of those credit
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:13.060]   cards for every $10,000 you spend, you get five elite nights, which means to get all the way to 60,
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:19.320]   you need to spend $120,000. Now, if you have a lot of tax payments, business expenses, or you're running
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.620]   a gift card site, you might have the spend to do it. But you might be asking yourself, is it even worth
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:30.780]   it? Now, if you're earning one Hyatt point per dollar at 1.7 cents per point, depending on who you
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.140]   ask, maybe you could call it 1.3, 1.5. It's not as good as other cards that might earn you three or four
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:41.620]   points until you think about it in the context of getting all the way to the status. So when I mapped
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.980]   out, what would it look like to get to 60 nights? How would I make it happen? Along the way, Hyatt gives
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:54.360]   you all these milestone rewards, right? For every 20, 40, 50, 60 threshold, you're getting sweet upgrade
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.680]   awards. You're getting free night certificates. You're getting bonus points. You're getting these
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.120]   things called a guest of honor certificate, which I will probably be doing a giveaway for later this year,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.680]   where you can gift someone else globalist status for a stay up to seven nights. And so when you add
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:16.720]   all those in, I put the value of spending money on that Hyatt card at about 3.4% back because you were
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:23.400]   getting the points and those perks, which made it worth going for. But it was over $100,000 of spend,
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.160]   which I didn't have entirely. Now, I did have some stays at Hyatt, so I didn't need to spend all of them.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.120]   But I ended up doing what I'd always heard people do and never done myself last year,
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.940]   which was I ended up going on what's called a mattress run. And so I found a category one property,
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.080]   which is the lowest tier. I found it at an off peak time. And I found it locally. So I only had
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:51.760]   to drive 20, 30 minutes to get to. And I ended up checking into this hotel for about three or 3,500
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.820]   points a night. And one of the perks of the Hyatt business card is you get a 10% rebate. So 3150 a
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820]   night, which those points were points I'd already used from spending on the card. So it kind of felt
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:09.340]   like a free stay. And I drove down, I checked in for a seven night stay. And I never stayed at the
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.460]   hotel once. I went to the front desk and I told them a story of, I'm checking in this hotel, I don't
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.620]   know if I'm going to stay here. And I don't know how many nights I'll be here. But if you could leave
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.680]   this room available, I will check in with you regularly. So you know that I might come back,
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.040]   I would really appreciate it. I put the do not disturb sign on. And every two days, I would text
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.180]   the front desk and say, I don't know if I'll need this room, but please keep it open for me. And they
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:37.700]   had no problem. The seven nights posted. And it was a lot easier than spending an extra, I don't know,
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.540]   for seven nights, you could probably call it somewhere on the order of $15,000 on the card. So
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:48.180]   ended up going for that. I'm really excited to put that to use this year, especially because
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:53.640]   one of the features of Hyatt that is unique is it's very easy to book suites. And so if you're
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.060]   traveling with a family, and you have kids that go to bed early, and you don't want to have to spend
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:04.400]   the time after they're in bed in a quiet, dark room sitting there being silent, not even being able to
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.020]   see much, you can book a suite. And Hyatt lets you confirm those suites at booking, or use suite upgrade
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:15.100]   awards to confirm them for no additional cost. And so doing that is just such a great experience when
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.400]   traveling with kids. So that's one of the reasons I'm excited about Hyatt Globalist,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.620]   among lots of others. So I will probably share more about that at the end of the year once we've
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:29.560]   been able to use that status. On the other two hotel statuses, there was a built promo to get a core
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:36.760]   platinum status. So I did that. And we have the Hilton Aspire card, which includes free Hilton diamond
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.240]   status. And those Hilton cards, which right now have really great signup bonuses, you can go to
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.140]   all the hacks.com slash cards and check them out. But they just make it so easy to earn free nights.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.660]   And as much as I love Hyatt, for certain reasons, married for some reasons, the thing I love about
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:57.060]   Hilton is that their free night certificates are good for any category hotel, as long as they have
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.980]   standard room availability. So we use those hotel certificates last year to stay at a hotel that
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:08.960]   was three or $4,000 a night. And right now open a card, the signup bonus includes a certificate.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.980]   Some of the cards, you get another one when you spend $15,000. Some of them, it's $30,000. It really
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:19.000]   depends. There's a different flavor of card for everyone. But the Aspire card also comes with diamond
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.100]   status on Hilton, which is their top tier. So that's how we ended up with four hotel status tiers. I guess
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.800]   I don't have any IHG status, but haven't stayed in an IHG hotel for a really long time. So I thought
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:36.100]   it'd be interesting to share all of that, because that's how I ended up where we are today. And I did all of
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:43.360]   that despite feeling like status wasn't an important thing. And I'm not really sure why we didn't even
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.940]   have a lot of travel planned this year. And as I reflect on this, and in the spirit of my conversation
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.280]   with Simon Sinek, I will try to be a little bit more vulnerable. Like, I think I just have a little
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:59.820]   bit of a problem where I enjoy figuring out a system and trying to kind of level up in the same way as a
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.460]   kid, I enjoyed playing Super Mario and trying to get to the end of the game. It was figure out all
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.660]   the strategies and the tactics to get through the level and get to the next one and get to the next
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:13.520]   one. And then at the end, you win, and you save the princess and everything's great. And each one of
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.960]   these challenges to get these statuses feels like that. It's like, oh, I want to get Hyatt status, but I
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.080]   want to find out if it's worth it. So I get to build this model and I get to figure out whether the ROI is
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:30.620]   good. Well, the ROI is good in that the amount of Hyatt points and milestone benefits I've earned
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:37.060]   are technically worth an amount that is greater than what I would have gotten if I used 3% cashback
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:42.880]   card. However, it's only greater if I actually use those benefits. And right now, we're sitting on
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.260]   millions of points and miles that we haven't used. And so I have to ask myself, if I look hard in the
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:55.740]   mirror, am I actually getting the value that I believe I'm getting? And in the points and miles
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.800]   world, if you talk to people that play it really, really hard, earning millions and millions and
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.960]   millions of points a month, what they find out is that they can't use the points fast enough and they
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.460]   end up cashing them out in various ways at way lower value than what you think there should be worth.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:15.740]   Right? If you're someone who only has a million Amex points, you might be able to use them for travel
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.680]   for the next three or four years. But if you had 50 million Amex points, you might never be able to use
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.980]   them for travel because there's just too many. And so even though there might be some amazing redemption
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.200]   that gets you two or three or four cents per point, if you're never going to take that redemption
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.520]   because you have too many points, then it's not worth that. And so I'm at a point where looking hard in the
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:40.720]   mirror is telling me that I should probably earn less points. I should probably stop chasing these
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.260]   statuses, even though I get a ton of satisfaction out of it. Or, and this is where I convince myself
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:53.140]   the alternative, we just say every year the kids are out of school, we just take a really big trip
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.580]   where we're staying in lots of hotels, using up all these points, traveling a lot, and really focus
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:06.020]   on going lots of places. And I rationalize some of this to myself saying, well, by earning status and
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:12.060]   earning points across tons of different programs, we have the ultimate flexibility, right? I tell myself
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:19.880]   that because we have points in, I don't know, probably five hotel groups and 15 airline groups and five
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:26.500]   transferable points groups, I now have the flexibility when we travel to stay anywhere we want because of all
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.460]   these programs. But that's not really true. Because we were talking about wanting to go visit the island of
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:39.620]   Lanai, or I think it's actually pronounced Lanai in Hawaii. And I'd heard a story of a trip report on
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.760]   another podcast where someone said it was the most magical trip they've ever taken. They said it was
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.360]   one of the best islands, you have to check it out. I actually have some friends that work to help design
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:54.140]   one of the hotels on the island. Turns out, they're just two Four Seasons hotels. And so no amount of
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.340]   Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, you know, IHG points or Amex points could be used for anything other than
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:06.980]   maybe booking in a travel portal a room at the Four Seasons. And so I think sometimes points are also
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:13.180]   restrictive. And what I've come to the conclusion of recently, is that I need to let go of those
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:20.080]   restrictions. And so one thing that I will start doing more of is using my points, even if it means
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   in the travel portal for one and a half cents, when I know they probably could get more value,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.000]   but just sitting there, they're not. And so that's something that I'm going to be making
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.640]   a change. Obviously, we haven't planned out all our travel for this year, but things will come up.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.500]   So I assume that these statuses will get put to good use. But I really think I need to start using
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.760]   these points, even if it's not the perfect redemption, because just letting them sit there,
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.060]   you know, they're constantly getting devalued, which I will talk about in a minute.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.360]   And if that money was sitting in cashback, it'd be earning interest.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.760]   So I owe it to myself to actually try to bring down the balance of points.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.920]   So stay tuned on how successful I am at this and really changing a little bit of this behavior.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.000]   But after I prepped for this episode and thought about how I should really be rethinking these,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.520]   I met with someone and they talked to me about how there's a way to earn Japan Airlines status
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   for life with one of their credit cards. And the renewal fee ends up being about 2000 miles.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:22.460]   So you can earn Japan Airlines status for life, which translates into a one world status
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:28.200]   that would give you priority seating and free check bags on American, on Alaska, lounge access,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.940]   all of those things forever. It was a huge spend requirement. But I came home and I was like,
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:40.680]   hmm, I just prepped an episode where I said I should stop thinking about this. And here I am again,
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:46.540]   wanting to go chase status on an airline that isn't even based in the US, which has reciprocal benefits
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:52.840]   on most airlines that I'm not flying when I'm also chasing status on an airline in that alliance
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.800]   separately. So we'll see where it goes. But one of the things I just mentioned was the reason to be
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.380]   using your points is that they're always getting devalued. And I sent this in the newsletter and
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.940]   something I'm going to try today is I'm going to try to run through some of the most interesting
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.940]   things that have been happening as well as some amazing listener stories. Some of these things
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.000]   have been in the newsletter. So if you're subscribed, a couple of them you might have heard, you might not
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.640]   have heard the commentary I'm going to give, but I've shared them a bit. But if you're not, and you want
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:24.300]   to make sure that when things like this happen, you hear about them, go to allthehacks.com slash email
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:30.140]   and you can sign up. So devaluations are something that happens all the time. And last year, we saw a
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:37.020]   handful of them across tons of different airlines. Just in 2025, we've already seen a few. Avianca, which was
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:43.880]   one of my preferred ways to use miles to fly on United or Air Canada or Lufthansa because they had such great
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:51.120]   deals. They just increased their award prices in business anywhere from 8% to 15%. In first class, all the way up to
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:57.620]   25%. So that kind of stuff happens all the time. It's one of the reasons that I love transferable points, because if you
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:03.200]   keep your points in Amex or Chase, and this happens to Avianca, well, now you can prioritize Air Canada, or you
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.440]   could prioritize United. Whereas if you accrue in one airline, and this happens, it makes it really
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:14.780]   difficult. On the hotel front, Marriott had big devaluations, they fluctuated a lot of the things, they've
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:21.760]   introduced dynamic award pricing. So it's not always clear what number of points you need for a room. There is a
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.440]   secret award chart that I'll link to in the show notes, but they've made some devaluations this year.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:34.000]   Hilton increased the points required for most premium properties, with some top tier hotels going way over 100,000 points
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.380]   a night. And then just recently, Hyatt did some category shifting, they moved 151 properties, 118 of which are going up in
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:49.700]   price. 33 are decreasing, but the vast majority are going up. So this is always happening in the industry. That's why I love the
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:57.100]   transferable points. But it is another good reason to not stash and hoard points, because you're just going to get
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.640]   stuck with them being worth less and less over time. Whereas had you earned cash, you would have been seeing them
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:07.860]   worth more and more over time. This episode is brought to you by Element. Now I love Element and I use it all the
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:14.860]   time because it helps anyone stay hydrated without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients in popular electrolyte and

[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:20.000]   rewards, which is an amazing points program with so many ways to earn including on your rent where you don't even need to
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.100]   check with your landlord. So let me explain. First, there's no cost to join built and as a member, you'll earn valuable points on
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:32.460]   rent and on your everyday spending. Built points can be transferred to your favorite hotels and airlines and even the ones you haven't
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:39.000]   heard of. There are over 500 airlines and 700,000 hotels and properties around the world you can redeem your built
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.660]   points toward. Points can be redeemed towards a future rent payment and unique experiences that only built members can
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:51.240]   access. So if you're not earning points on rent, my question is why not? Start earning points on rent you're already paying
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:33:00.080]   by going to chrishutchins.com slash built. That's chrishutchins.com slash built, B-I-L-T. Make sure to use our URL so they know we
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.000]   sent you chrishutchins.com slash built or the link in the description to start earning points on your rent payments
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.540]   today. A few other things in the newsletter before I share some really creative ways that a lot of our listeners have earned
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:19.840]   millions of points. And there are actually ways that you can use as well. One, there are some really awesome
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:25.080]   card-linked offers right now. So I'm not going to go through all of them because they're often only good
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.380]   for a month at a time and they change depending on who you are. So some people are targeted for some,
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:37.500]   some aren't. Each week in the newsletter, at least each week that I find relevant ones, I'm sharing some of the
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.660]   best ones. I'm trying to go through as a filter because you might have four or five hundred card-linked
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:47.360]   offers on any given one of your credit cards, but they might be for products and services and brands
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.100]   you don't have any interest in. I'm trying to find the ones that I think have the most broad appeal that
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.500]   you should know about. One trick that I like to use, and it saved me probably at least a few hundred
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:05.340]   dollars if not more, is use an app that automatically adds all of your card-linked offers to your cards.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.640]   So the wild thing is there might be an offer on your Amex, U.S. Bank, Bank of America card
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.780]   that you just haven't activated. Even if you go spend money at the merchant that there is an offer
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.460]   and you haven't activated the offer, you won't get the cash back or the bonus points. And so I really
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.900]   like an app called Card Pointers. You can go to allthehacks.com slash cardpointers to get, I believe
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:31.420]   it's 30% off. Members actually get 50% off. Or there's a new one, I think SaveWise is also offering
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:37.340]   this service. And there's an app called Max Rewards that for kind of security reasons, I can't endorse
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.740]   that app right now, though I know lots of people that have had a good experience. But there are three
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.620]   offers that are really interesting that are probably a lot bigger than most of them. You'll see an offer
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:52.160]   that's 10% off or 5% off or $10 off. But there's three right now that are really big. One of them is
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:58.640]   for Calm. And if you have either the Chase Reserve or the Chase Preferred card, you can get 50 to 100%
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.920]   back on an annual membership. So the Reserve is going for a full 100% back on a Calm annual membership
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:10.320]   through the end of May. So that's really awesome. The Preferred only gets 50% back. And they're all
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.760]   kind of in the health and wellness area. The next one is for a company called Lifeforce. So I haven't
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.380]   actually used this product. But I'm prepping an episode about all the different kinds of health
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:25.980]   diagnostics you can do. So I've been trying a lot of things out. They have a diagnostic where you do
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.880]   50 plus biomarkers, blood tests, service, and then you get a consultation with a clinician. It's $599.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.040]   But there's an offer right now on both Chase Reserve and Preferred for $300 back.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.580]   And then the last one is with Pronuvo, which I've talked about in the past, I've done a full body MRI with
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:50.360]   Pronuvo two times in the past. Normally, that would cost $2,500. And if you do have a Chase Reserve card,
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:57.960]   you get a $600 back offer. So that brings the cost down to $1,900. However, one thing not everyone
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.880]   might know is that Pronuvo, like many other health services, is eligible for an HSA or an FSA.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:11.680]   So let's say you were to spend that $2,500, but reimburse yourself from your FSA or an HSA,
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.480]   depending on your tax bracket and where you're at, that could bring that cost down, maybe at the highest
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.180]   tax bracket in California, in half. Maybe in other places, it comes down a third. But just for the sake
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:27.820]   of argument, let's say you bring it down in half to $1,250. So you've saved $1,250 in taxes on that
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.740]   Pronuvo scan from using tax-advantaged accounts, but you're also going to get $600 off. So if you stack
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:39.400]   those two offers, it can really bring the price of that service down. I have had one friend whose
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:45.840]   full-body MRI resulted in learning about something that very likely would have been a tumor that killed
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.080]   them in the next six months. It was pretty serious and resulted in some kind of very,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:56.020]   very last-minute surgeries. And most people have found very few things. If you're someone that
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.980]   learning about a few things that might be off would really make you nervous, then it's probably not for
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.320]   you. But I imagine if you're more like me, where more information is better, it's been really helpful
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:12.540]   to know what areas of your body are things to focus on. It can obviously spot things much earlier.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.740]   There's so many amazing stories of people whose lives have actually changed getting a Pronuvo scan.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.400]   In fact, I just pulled up on the website. There's tons of stories you can go read, but they're saying
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:27.680]   one in 20 scans result in a potentially life-saving diagnosis. Super interesting service. I have done it
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:33.440]   before in the past. Full disclosure, one of them I paid for, one of them I did not. I had met someone
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.760]   connected to Pronuvo and told them I was doing this health diagnostics episode. And they said,
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.400]   Josh, if you haven't gotten a scan in the last year, why don't you come in and get one so you
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.620]   can talk a little bit more about the experience we have today. They also did set up allthehacks.com
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:52.440]   slash Pronuvo, which has a discount. And so I actually, I think you could potentially stack
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:59.020]   a discount plus the Chase rebate, plus your HSA, FSA, and get it even lower. But just make sure that
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:05.680]   the requirements of the card linked offer don't require you to spend an amount that a discount
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.820]   might bring you below. So just make sure you could do that. I don't want you to get a $100 discount
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:15.820]   that prevents you from getting a $600 savings. Also on the note of card linked offers, I finally
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:21.760]   opened my first Citi thank you points card, which was the Citi Premier card. It had a 75,000 point
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.360]   offer, which I took advantage of. And so now I have not been able to talk a lot about the Citi thank you
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.260]   point experience. And now that I have a card, I'm going really deep on it, I might actually do a
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:38.440]   series where I go down the rabbit hole of the entire rewards program for every single major issuer.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:44.300]   So do one for Citi and for everyone else. So stay tuned for that. A few other things that I've shared
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:49.840]   in the newsletter that I thought would be fun to share here. One of my favorite things about the
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.440]   Animal Spirits podcast, which is really about markets and investing, is that they always talk about
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.600]   their favorite shows. And so I started adding that to the newsletter. And I realized people wrote me
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.640]   back every single time saying, Oh my gosh, I love that show. That was such a good tip. Or I love that
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.880]   show to check out this other one. And those things never made it to the podcast. And I don't really
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:13.660]   know how to fit them into the format of the show we do regularly. But I will just say that a few of the
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.800]   shows that recently I've loved that I've been sharing on the newsletter were Paradise. I think
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.680]   see episode seven of Paradise was one of my favorite episodes of television. And so highly recommend
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:29.060]   don't even look up what it is because I loved being surprised. I had no context going into it really
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:36.320]   like Landman about the oil and gas industry silo day of the jackal. Those are all great. There's more
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.400]   recommendations that are regularly coming in the newsletter. If you have any show recommendations
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.800]   based on those, and other ones you've seen me mentioned, definitely send them my way. Another
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.900]   little tip I shared recently is that Uber, if you're traveling abroad is starting to add a one and a half
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:56.160]   percent fee for the convenience of displaying prices in your home currency. Everyone's automatically
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.800]   getting opted into that. So anyone who travels internationally and uses Uber, go into your app,
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.740]   go into the wallet and select no preferred currency and save yourself one and a half percent on those rides.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.640]   This episode is brought to you by Viore, which is amazing because they are one of only the few brands I
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:17.680]   wear almost every single day. I've got a shirt on. I've got the core shorts on. I love Viore and I love
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.480]   that they bring a new perspective on performance apparel. It's so versatile. It can be used for just
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:28.080]   about any activity, whether it's running, training, swimming, yoga, or even lounging or running errands
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.500]   or going out to dinner. Seriously, I wear my meta pants out for dinner all the time. But today I want to
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.820]   talk about their dream knit collection because it's amazing. It is super soft, lightweight, moisture
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:44.100]   wicking, but also has this amazing four-way performance stretch that makes it so comfortable.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.660]   While it's almost impossible to narrow my Viore recommendations down to just one thing, I want you
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:53.580]   to check out the Ponto performance jogger for men or the performance jogger for women. I know me and my
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:58.900]   wife, Amy, absolutely love them and wear them all the time. Seriously, I think Viore is an investment in
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:04.380]   your happiness. And for everyone watching, they're offering 20% off your first purchase plus free shipping

[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:34.000]   times on the podcast and multiple times in the newsletter that I think is really worth sharing
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.060]   again is to go check for unclaimed money. And the way this works is there are circumstances where
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.120]   someone might owe you money, they can't get it to you, or you haven't cashed a check. And so they pass
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.860]   it over to the state. This might happen with a cable bill or a medical bill that you overpaid or you
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:58.220]   canceled an insurance policy and they owe you a refund. And why I share this is because even though I've
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.400]   shared it multiple times in the newsletter, I thought I'm going to share it again. And I'm
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:08.080]   actually going to do a quick poll of how much unclaimed money people found. And while 47% of the
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.620]   people subscribed found no money, which kind of made sense. I've shared this in the past. Not everyone
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:21.220]   finds it. The results of the other 53% were super interesting. So 31% found less than $100. 15% found
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:31.800]   100 to $500. 3% found 500 to $1,000. And 5% found over $1,000 of unclaimed money in their name. And we had
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:40.440]   250 people respond to this. So 250.05. That's 12 people. 12 people found $1,000 just by going to their
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.480]   state's unclaimed money site and searching. If you haven't done that before, highly encourage you to do
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.540]   it for yourself, for your spouse, if you have old enough kids that they might be in this
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.640]   circumstance, for your parents, for really anyone. I've always said in the past that it's kind of a
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.400]   fun party trick. If you show up to someone's party, you can bring them a bottle of wine or you could
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.080]   check in advance and see if they are owed thousands of dollars. And obviously, I don't know about you,
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.380]   but $1,000 seems like a much better gift than a bottle of wine. So each week, we're sending out all
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:11.220]   kinds of stuff like this, whether it's new card offers, gift cards, deals, promos for bonus points,
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.900]   freebies. A couple of weeks ago, there was free Starbucks and Febreze plugins and Slurpees,
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.240]   transfer bonuses and all that. So allthehacks.com slash email if you want them more regularly.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:27.100]   I've even considered doing a little quick Saturday episode that just runs through the highlights of
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.040]   the offers for the week. It wouldn't be edited. It wouldn't be produced that well, but it would be
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.140]   turned around really fast. So something I'm considering. But for now, it seems easier to
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.520]   write them and email them out because it's more time sensitive.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:45.640]   Okay. Last thing I want to cover is a question that I get from so many people. And it's about
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.040]   getting started and whether all the crazy things I'm doing are really even possible for the average
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.580]   person. And so in the spirit of all this talk about earning the most, having the most amazing
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:01.520]   experiences, I want to share five short but incredible stories from listeners about how they
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:08.660]   were able to save a combined $100,000 doing various points and miles things as people that
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.020]   aren't me. They're not going down the rabbit hole as deep as I am. Some of them just got started in
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.840]   the last year and they've had really, really incredible experiences. So first, Winnetta took
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.320]   her honeymoon in Bora Bora and a baby moon to Greece and Croatia. So congrats, double congrats.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.240]   To get to Bora Bora, they transferred Ultimate Rewards points to United for the first flight.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:35.020]   They managed to find three nights at the St. Regis, getting 2.9 cents per point, saving over $9,000.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:42.540]   When they went to Greece and Croatia, they did 10 days back in 2024 and they credited episode 166,
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:47.400]   which is where we went through all the best tools for the way they were able to book this just three
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.980]   weeks in advance. So they used PointsYah and they found an amazing deal. They used the Venturex for
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.940]   lounge access. They used the travel credits for their rental car. And then the cash value of the
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:05.180]   whole trip was way over $6,000 they saved. But the real treat of all of this, and this is why I love
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:10.460]   the Points Game, is that they said they got to travel more and in style that they never would have for so
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:17.260]   much less. And I think there's something to be said for the fact that many times, maybe you would have
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:22.000]   had more money than you would have spent on a trip, but you might not have taken the trip or you might not
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.040]   have taken the trip in the style you want. And sometimes those little luxuries and that extra
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:33.720]   trip make the year, the month, the whatever period of time so much better. So one of the reasons I love
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.780]   Points and Miles, so glad you got to take both of those trips. Congrats. Next one is from Corey,
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:45.700]   who basically had an almost free honeymoon in Japan. They did ANA's The Room, which was an incredible
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:51.820]   business class or I guess first class product I've never taken. They booked an older business class
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:58.240]   product on ANA on the way back. And they did four nights at the brand new Hotel Indigo in Shibuya in
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:04.140]   Japan, two nights at the Intercon Beppu, then some nights at the Grand Hyatt Fukuoku, the Hyatt Place
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:11.020]   Kyoto, and the Andaz Sol. They said almost the entire thing was free. Over $20,000 of value from signup
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.960]   bonuses on a few cards, the only thing that wasn't covered was they did stay at a Four Seasons in
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:24.420]   Seoul, but they used their Amex Platinum FHR benefit to get $200 a night off. So that's awesome. Nothing
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:31.580]   like taking a $20,000 honeymoon for a significant fraction of that cost. Next, I want to share what
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:38.680]   Jake did, which was really awesome. He took three trips last year, burned 1.3 million points, went to
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:45.280]   Japan, inspired by episodes 101 and 102, which are, I assume, the ones I did with Brandon Presser. Two
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:52.920]   business class tickets for 400,000 points, 150,000 points to stay at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, which I
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.380]   think right now is under renovations. But when it's done, I think it's supposed to be really, really nice.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.640]   Did another trip to Prague to go do IVF. He actually was a little bit of the inspiration for this medical
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.060]   tourism episode because he said, hey, did you know it's way cheaper to go to Prague to do IVF than it
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.280]   is to even just do it in Houston? He's like, our system's really broken, but you should do an episode
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:17.480]   on that. And that kind of led down to this rabbit hole. But in specific numbers, he said the quote for
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:23.080]   IVF at home was $30,000 to $50,000. And they spent $5,000, had a great experience in Prague.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.640]   And when you include everything, treatment, travel, food, they still spent less than half the cost of
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:34.080]   IVF at home and got a trip out of it. Did three legs on KLM with points and got a really great value
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:40.300]   saving thousands of dollars there. And then finally, they went back for the IVF transfer and spent some
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.600]   time in Budapest. So that's awesome. Glad you were able to take advantage of medical travel.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.140]   I'm actually looking at the recap. They said they got an average of four cents a point from all 1.3
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:54.240]   million points. And a lot of these people said that this is not something that they've been doing for
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.740]   a while. And they said just listening and taking the leap has been what made this happen and really
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:02.920]   stoked. Kieran wrote in saying they weren't really into points. It was a thing, a hobby of the past.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:08.840]   And just last year, they got into it. And then by the end of this year, already set to accumulate a
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:16.160]   million miles. From a combo of signup bonuses and spend, they're really racking it up. So that is
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.600]   awesome. I know for some people hearing this, they think a million miles, it sounds so unachievable.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:28.460]   It sounds so crazy. And then I think of myself, a couple days ago, I did what is often called an
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:35.340]   Aparama. But I basically opened up a Bank of America, Alaska business card and a city American
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:42.320]   card. And the signup bonus on all three of those totaled about 225,000 points. And both my wife and
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:48.920]   I this year opened up an Amex business gold when it was a 200,000 point signup bonus. So last year,
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.680]   those five cards, which weren't all the cards we opened up last year and includes none of the
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:01.360]   spending was already over 600,000 points. And so and that's just one under my wife. So if she had
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.840]   just done the exact same thing as I did, probably easily be at a million. And that was just what we
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:13.060]   did in the tail end of the year. So definitely something that's possible, even if you don't have
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:19.780]   a ton of business spend to do. Last is one of my favorite stories. So Brandon sent in this epic
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:25.600]   photo, which with his permission, I will put in the show notes, they had a contractor who was building
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.800]   out some renovations or their house. And he asked if they could pay for the building materials. So their
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.020]   contractor wouldn't let them pay by credit card, but they were willing to let them go to Lowe's and pay
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:43.740]   for the materials themselves. And so they had about $170,000 to spend at Lowe's. First, they bought all
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.800]   the Lowe's gift cards they could at a deal. Unfortunately, they were only able to get up to
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:53.020]   5,000. This was before I had launched the gift card site. And then they put the rest on their credit
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:58.140]   cards. And between him and his brother, they stacked out a bunch of different credit cards, rang it up to
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:05.680]   $170,000. And if you just assume an average return of let's call it two points or two and a half
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:11.440]   percent, they earned back over $4,000 of value. I didn't ask him which cards. I'm going to hope
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.320]   there were a bunch of signup bonuses in there. If there were five or six signup bonuses, well,
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.500]   that could have been, you know, millions and millions and millions of points. But I didn't
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.060]   ask which cards there were. If there were a bunch of signup bonuses in there, who knows? It could have
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:29.120]   been a million, 2 million points. It really depends on the spending patterns. But $170,000 for just
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:35.080]   asking a question, I encourage everyone to try to do something similar themselves. Anytime they're playing
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:41.540]   any time they're trying to earn more, there's always something that comes from asking, can I pay you with
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:47.700]   a credit card? What would that cost? Is this possible? There are some banks that let you pay
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:53.940]   bills by credit card. Never hurts to ask. So really, really stoked to hear all those stories. If you have
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:59.520]   any similar stories of huge wins in the points and miles, in the health, in the any category we've ever
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.160]   discussed on the show, send them in. Podcast at allthehacks.com. I love hearing them. Thank you so much for
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.860]   joining this week. I will see you next week.
