[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   - Podcast listener named Lisa writes in
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.020]   to ask about chronic lateness.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.620]   She asks this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.820]   "is habitual tardiness a sin?
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.220]   "How would you go about talking to fellow church members
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.600]   "who are consistently late, like 10 or 15,
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.300]   "or even 20 minutes late for their commitments?"
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.600]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.040]   - Well, maybe if I approach this in a certain way,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.960]   it will prove useful,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.320]   not just for dealing with chronically late people,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.320]   but perhaps with other irritants or foibles or flaws
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.360]   that people have that we need to either address
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.920]   or just work around.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.920]   So I hope what I say here will be of broader use
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220]   than only that one particular issue.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.600]   And the first thing we need to say, of course,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960]   everybody would think of this, I think,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   is consider the culture you live in.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.560]   Whether a person is late is determined in part
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.280]   by cultural expectations of when one ought to arrive,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.400]   and there are some cultural differences
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.120]   among varying groups.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.720]   And of course, we think of cultures
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.040]   that are less oriented on precision,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.880]   the kind that's demanded by Western transportation
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   and industry.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.960]   Such cultures may have, for generations,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.520]   governed their gatherings by where the sun is in the sky,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.840]   not where the hands are on the clock.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.400]   And therefore, one would not be considered late
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.720]   if he comes half an hour on either side
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.640]   or maybe an hour on either side.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.880]   In that culture, that's just the way it is.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.760]   When I was in Germany back in the '70s,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.240]   I was invited to my doctor father's house
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.940]   for an evening gathering, first time ever.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.240]   I'm new in a German situation, didn't know what to expect.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.920]   So I took the train, and by the way,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120]   you can count on the trains being on time in Munich,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.280]   Germany, took the train to Tuzing from Munich
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.960]   and walked around till about five before the hour
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.920]   and rang the doorbell, and a sinking feeling came over me
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.640]   when his wife opened the door
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120]   with a kind of surprised look on her face.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600]   And I thought, "Oh no, I've got the wrong night.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   I came on the wrong day."
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.720]   And she recovered quickly and invited me in.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   And later, I was told, "Well, really,
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.920]   the really ideal time to arrive is five minutes
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.480]   after the appointed time, not five minutes before."
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, you just learn what late means and what early means.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.760]   So that's the first thing, is culture.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.680]   For most of the Western world,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.020]   the demands of industry and travel have created a culture
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.020]   where lateness can be not only annoying or disrespectful
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.520]   or inconvenient, but even dangerous.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.940]   Both to the person who is late and those who have to wait.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.600]   For example, if you're late for an airplane,
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.820]   you're gonna miss your flight.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.620]   That may be a big deal.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.680]   If you're in the military and the order that you have
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   is at 1900 hours, there will be Air Force firepower,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.460]   and you can take your platoon and run for 15 minutes
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.600]   across this open territory
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.360]   because they won't be able to shoot at you.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000]   You miss that by three minutes,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.040]   and maybe most of you are dead.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.280]   So lateness can be a major, major issue
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.080]   or a minor inconvenience.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.160]   Once you've discerned the level of expectation in the group
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.880]   that you belong to, and once you have figured out
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.040]   the measure of inconvenience or irritation or disturbance
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.640]   or even danger that a person might bring about,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.900]   then you have to discern how much effort do I put
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.720]   into helping somebody not be late?
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.360]   And it becomes a moral issue, the Bible says,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.400]   if you're doing wrong to your neighbor.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.760]   Love does no wrong to a neighbor.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.240]   And if lateness is wronging the group in some way,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.520]   making their work harder, then you're not acting in love,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.400]   and then it becomes a moral issue.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   And Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13 that love is not rude.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.080]   And that idea of rude means doesn't offend
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.880]   against cultural expectations,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.960]   and rudeness changes from culture to culture.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.400]   Love is not so wrapped up in itself
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.080]   that it doesn't pay attention to such things
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.800]   as what the expectations are in this group.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.880]   The Bible also says love counts others
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.320]   more significant than ourselves.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   And love takes thought for the interests of others,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.520]   not just for ourselves.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   So in cases of lateness, they can become a serious sin issue
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.860]   if enough people are being seriously hampered
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.200]   by your lateness.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.040]   So what do you do?
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.640]   What do you do if you know someone,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.480]   or you're in that group,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.400]   and they need somebody to help them,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.920]   and it's causing inconvenience,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.800]   it's disrupting, it's hindering?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.060]   Here's what I would do.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.920]   Number one, I would gently, perhaps jokingly,
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.440]   point out to a person in private
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.640]   and say that it would be helpful if they got there on time.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.760]   Leave it at that, no big deal.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.920]   One simple suggestion, see if it helps,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.800]   and my guess, it would help a lot of people.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.480]   If it doesn't produce any change at all,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.180]   I would get alone with that person a second time,
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.180]   and I would ask if there's a problem,
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.680]   if there's a reason why they're always late
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.960]   and why they can't get there on time.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.440]   And you may discover something
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.020]   that you could help them with.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.900]   Or you may discover, and this happens,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.280]   that there's simply a personality disconnect here
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   of some kind,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.600]   and it makes them habitually inattentive to time.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.800]   And in that case, the question is,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.700]   do you have enough relational capital
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.080]   to work on that with them?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.000]   If you don't, you're probably not gonna be able to do much.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.120]   But if you do, if they're willing to let you
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.600]   into their life, then you might say,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.260]   how about setting your alarm 15 minutes earlier
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.100]   in the morning?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.080]   Or you might say, I've got an app, it's really good,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.160]   it's called blank, my wife has one, I have one.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.460]   I've got an app on my phone, and you can set this app
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.960]   for any appointment you want, any way you want,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.780]   gives you warnings ahead of time,
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.340]   and how about setting that up?
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.780]   How about letting me set it up for you?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.180]   How about I download it for, in other words,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.360]   you got to determine, is this person's inattentiveness
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.200]   such that he's gonna walk away and say, good idea,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.480]   and never do it?
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.320]   Or can you do it for him?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.540]   Now, of course, all that requires an enormous amount
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.560]   of humility on the part of the other person
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.600]   who's being late, to admit that they have a problem.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.240]   That takes humility, to admit that they have a problem
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.720]   and they can't solve it on their own.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.680]   And will they submit to your counsel?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.880]   Will they assume a position of a needy person
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.600]   who's not able to run their life
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.480]   as effectively as they'd like, and that bothers other people?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.240]   And if you don't encounter that kind of humility
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.380]   that lets you work with them in some practical way,
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.720]   but resistant, then you're probably just gonna need
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.680]   to pray for them and work around them.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.040]   And that means that they probably won't ever assume
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.440]   a certain role in that group, where you need more precision,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.240]   more care, more intentionality and attentiveness,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.480]   and you're just gonna expect them to be late
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.960]   and take them for what they are.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.840]   In other words, some things we change,
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.360]   some things we forgive, some things we forbear,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.120]   and we need wisdom to know which is which for this person.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.000]   - Wise words.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.520]   And Lisa, thank you for the question.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.920]   Tomorrow, we're gonna close out the week
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.240]   with a very sobering topic
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.040]   related to recent events in Oregon.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.800]   Recently, a 26-year-old man walked onto the campus
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.160]   of a community college in Roseburg, Oregon
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   with three pistols and a semi-automatic rifle
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.320]   and targeted Christians.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.200]   He killed 10 and himself.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.840]   So gun to my head, would I deny Christ?
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.700]   That's what one listener wonders about,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.680]   and asked John Piper how we could ever possibly
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.800]   be prepared for such a moment like that.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.640]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.240]   I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
