[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Well, how do we avoid overthinking or under thinking the Christian life?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.240]   It's a relevant question for a podcast that spends a lot of its time
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.400]   talking about the Christian life.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.400]   And the question today comes from a listener named Ronnie.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.580]   Hello, Pastor Jon, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060]   I've been richly blessed by this podcast over the years.
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.780]   So thank you.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.620]   I know you are a great nuts guy.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.560]   I am too.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.280]   So I chuckled when I read this in GK Chesterton's book, heretics, where he
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.240]   says this, there is more simplicity in the man who eats caviar on impulse.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.660]   Then in the man who eats grape nuts on principle, the chief error of these
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.760]   people is to be found in the very phrase to which they are most attached.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.880]   Plain living and high thinking.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.000]   These people do not stand in need of, will not be improved by
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.640]   plain living and high thinking.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   They stand in need of the contrary.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.640]   They would be improved by high living and plain thinking.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.000]   So do you ever wonder or harbor a concern over, and in this podcast, I
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.280]   think maybe an expression of, an overthinking of all the details and
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000]   options in the Christian life at the expense of simply living our
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240]   lives with the joy of impulse?
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.760]   In other words, Pastor Jon, can we overthink the Christian life?
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   Well, a complex mental tortured eating of great nuts is probably inferior to a
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.800]   spontaneous, happy, simple eating of caviar.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.960]   But I wonder about a spontaneous, simple eating of grape nuts.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.360]   Here's my answer to whether you can overthink things.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.720]   The answer is yes.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.400]   We can overthink our lives.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.760]   And if Ronnie were to ask me if we can underthink our lives, I would say yes.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.200]   We can underthink our lives.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.280]   And the problem is not just quantity over and under thinking.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   The problem is quality as well, like thinking carefully and thinking sloppy
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.880]   or thinking truly and thinking falsely.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   Now, whether this podcast is guilty of overthink or underthink and sloppy
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.840]   think and false think, others will have to judge.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.520]   But yes, I'm aware of the danger.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.080]   Just this morning, just to give you some examples of how aware I tend to be, just
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.600]   this morning, I was listening to an audio version of C.S.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.880]   Lewis' essay on subjectivism.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.360]   Excellent essay.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.400]   Everybody, I wish, would read it.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.640]   He was talking about the dangers of turning away from the real world and
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.400]   thinking about the world outside to an excessive introspection where we try to
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.120]   discern the true and the beautiful and the criterion for the true and the
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.640]   beautiful and the absolute inside.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   And in a typical genius for comparisons, Lewis compared turning inside for the
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.560]   sight of the absolute and the true and the beautiful.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.280]   He compared it to taking your eyeballs out to look at them.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.440]   I was getting dressed and I just thought, that is just helpful.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.120]   We become blind in the very act of analysis as we try to see.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.480]   It's what Wordsworth, I suppose, is getting at.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.320]   We murder to dissect.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.400]   So that's what Ronnie is waving a big yellow flag in front of Piper and saying,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.520]   "You sure you want to do this podcast?"
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   Now, of course, Chesterton and Lewis are two happy peas in a pod when it comes to
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.040]   helping us not overthink or underthink or badly think.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.880]   But they also offer a warning because no Christian in the 20th century applied the
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.320]   razor of the law of non-contradiction to all the follies of the world the way C.S.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.960]   Lewis did.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.680]   I think I can say that without exception.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.040]   No Christian in the 20th century applied the razor of the law of non-contradiction
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.720]   to all the follies of the world the way C.S.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.280]   Lewis did.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   And Chesterton did the same thing in his own way.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.040]   Chesterton wasn't nearly as given, I think, to a direct analysis as Lewis was.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.000]   But, oh my, behind all those paradoxes, there was a razor sharp mind who did his
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.720]   fair analysis of the world.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.800]   Both would agree that logicians go crazy.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.480]   That would be my danger, right?
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.840]   Logicians, you know, excessively picking apart and analyzing and being logical.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.040]   Logicians go crazy because they try to get the heavens into their head.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.120]   But poets are mentally healthy because they try to get their heads into the
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.840]   heavens.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.600]   That's what Chesterton said, and they would both agree on that.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.480]   But both would also agree that one should use his head to avoid putting it in a
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.440]   meat grinder.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   Does the Bible give us help in not falling off cliffs of over and under
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.400]   thinking?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.040]   And I think the Bible does help us, and I'm going to give three kinds of help
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.680]   real quickly.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.200]   First, it celebrates thinking.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.400]   You cannot blow off thinking if you want to be a Bible person.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.080]   Second Timothy 2.7, "Think over what I say, and the Lord will give you
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.200]   understanding in everything."
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.120]   So thinking is valuable as a prelude to receiving divine illumination.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.640]   Second, I've got three texts.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.040]   Second, "Brothers, do not be children in your thinking.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.760]   Be infants in evil, but in your thinking, be mature."
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.920]   So thinking is a mark of being a grown-up.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   A third text, Romans 12.2, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.320]   transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.080]   So thinking is part of Christian newness in Christ.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.240]   So that's the first thing that the Bible does to help us not fall off the cliff
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   of over or under thinking.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.600]   It celebrates the importance, like, be a grown-up.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.680]   Think clearly.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.240]   The second thing it does, or the second thing the Bible does, is show us that
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.600]   thinking is not an end in itself.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.120]   Thinking exists to serve love, 1 Timothy 1.5.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   Thinking exists to serve joy, 1 Peter 1.8.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.240]   Joy inexpressible and glorified.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.560]   Thinking exists to serve peace of heart and mind.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.040]   That passes thinking, Philippians 4.8.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.120]   So you think your way up, and then God, the Holy Spirit, zooms you on
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.800]   beyond what you can compute.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.120]   Thinking in the Bible is never the final goal of life.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.880]   I wrote a whole book called "Think."
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.520]   That was my main point, I think, that the Bible never makes thinking
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.920]   the final goal of life.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:23.840]   The head, where the thinking is, the head must do its supporting work so that the
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.320]   heart can do its main work and not be deceived.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   So that's the second way the Bible helps us not fall off the cliff of over or
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.920]   under thinking.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.360]   And here's the last, the third and last thing the Bible does.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.840]   The Bible encourages us, and I think at this point Chesterton and Lewis would be
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.400]   jumping up and down with happiness.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:56.440]   The Bible directs our thoughts outward, outward, away from subjectivism, away from
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.600]   introspection, to the right comprehension of great, glorious things.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.000]   I mean, Philippians 4.8 and 9 are simply amazing for their simplicity.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.440]   "Finally, brothers, whatever's true, whatever's honorable, whatever's just,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.640]   whatever's pure, whatever's lovely, whatever's commendable, if there's any
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:23.760]   excellence, if there's anything worthy of praise, think, think about these things."
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.800]   In other words, stop standing in front of the mirror and worrying about your hair
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.520]   and your whatever, you're all worked up about, but get over to the window, go to
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.440]   the window and look out.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.320]   "What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.040]   things and the God of peace will be with you."
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.120]   So think about the right things and practice the right things, and the God of
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.680]   peace gets very close and precious.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.760]   "Set your thinking not only on what is true, etc., but what is above."
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.800]   Colossians 3.2, "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.600]   the earth, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.840]   When Christ, who is your life, appears, you will appear with him in glory.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.320]   So be about the business of taking your minds and all your thinking and make
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:26.080]   heaven and all the realities of God in Christ the focus of your thinking.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:33.800]   And then one more, Hebrews 12.3, "Look to Jesus, look to Jesus, the founder and
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.200]   perfecter of your faith.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.640]   Consider him," that word "consider," think about him, "who endured from sinners
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.520]   such hostility."
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.880]   So you want to do something right with your mind and your thinking, put it on
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.840]   things that are true, put it on things that are above, put it on things that are
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.960]   Christ-ward, put it on Christ himself.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.440]   So my three suggestions for how the Bible helps us to be summed up like this, helps
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.040]   us not be overthinking, underthinking, badly thinking, falsely thinking.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.560]   Number one, the Bible commends thinking as part of being mature.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.280]   Number two, it keeps thinking in its place and makes joy, peace, and love the
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.320]   touchstone of whether it's doing its work.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.000]   If it's not producing joy, peace, and love, it's not doing its work.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.400]   We're thinking badly.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:30.680]   And thirdly, it points us away from excessive introspection and subjectivism
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.080]   and says, "Send your thinking again and again to truth and to Christ."
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.360]   So good.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.640]   Yeah, not overthinking, not underthinking, and not badly thinking, and not falsely
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.080]   thinking.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.240]   Well, how has God at work in our most unproductive days when it feels as
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.360]   though we've accomplished nothing and we fall far short of our own planning,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.280]   when everything we set out to do has collapsed into nothing but inefficiency
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.840]   and unproductivity?
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.280]   Those frustrating days are not outside of God's sovereign power.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.080]   And when we return on Monday, we're going to talk about what God is doing in our
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.840]   lives in the days when everything seems to fall apart.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.800]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.880]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   God bless.
