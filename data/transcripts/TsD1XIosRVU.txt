[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.780]   The goal for us at this point as we come to the Word of God is to consider the glory of
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:18.080]   our Savior, and so I want you to turn to the second chapter of Hebrews, the second chapter
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:32.120]   of Hebrews, and while this section of Scripture is worthy of careful, detailed explanation,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.840]   we'll try to hit the highlights.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.760]   Now the book of Hebrews was written to Jews, obviously.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.960]   Some of them had believed in Christ, and they understood the gospel.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.800]   They understood the gospel fairly well.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.380]   Others of them were sort of in the process of considering Christ, and they needed further
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.220]   clarification to understand more about Him before they made the break with Judaism that
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.200]   would cost them so much.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.140]   There were other Jews who were just on the outside looking in, but to all of them, this
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.840]   letter is written to demonstrate.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:32.200]   It's written to demonstrate that Jesus is the Savior of the world, the one true Savior.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.940]   And that means that He's going to have to be presented very carefully, particularly
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.760]   to Jewish people, because they have a highly developed theology.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.720]   And so the writer begins to write.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.160]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."

[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   He says, "I am the Savior of the world."
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.520]   Who's it talking about?
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.280]   It was fitting for Him - that's God - for whom are all things, and through whom are
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.180]   all things.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.240]   That sounds like the doxology in Romans, chapter 11.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.540]   It was fitting for God.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:30.740]   It was fitting for God in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.740]   through sufferings.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.540]   Amen?
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:39.340]   Author could be pioneer, could be leader.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:45.480]   The word archegos is in the book of Acts, actually translated "prince of life" when
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.080]   referring to Christ.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:59.920]   So He, though placed in a lowly position for His time here, was always elevated as the
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.520]   sovereign Lord and Savior.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.340]   God knew that if He was going to bring many sons to glory, there had to be someone to
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.700]   perfect the author of salvation.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:23.060]   Later in the book of Hebrews it says, "Christ perfected our salvation through His death."
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.960]   The verse begins, "It was fitting for Him."
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.280]   It fit God's wisdom.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.060]   You could say the cross was the masterpiece of wisdom.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.500]   It fit His holiness.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.000]   It demonstrated God's hatred for sin.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.060]   It agreed with His grace because it was an act of love to bring forgiveness.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.980]   It was fitting with His powers, the greatest power display ever.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:57.680]   Christ endured a few hours of darkness, took the full fury of the wrath of God for all
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.000]   the people who would ever be saved through all of human history.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.900]   He is the archegos, the leader, the prince, the pioneer, the source.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.240]   That word is an interesting word.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:19.720]   It has to do with a person who begins something and takes other people with him, like a father
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:27.440]   of a family, or someone who founded a city, or someone who blazed a trail for others to
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440]   follow.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.000]   And in that sense, He is our sovereign and our king.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   He is the archegos, the leader, the prince, the pioneer, the source.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That word is an interesting word. It has to do with a person who begins something and takes other people with Him, like a father of a family, or someone who founded a city, or someone who blazed a trail for others to follow. And in that sense, He is our sovereign and our king.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.980]   He is our sovereign and our king.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:39.380]   And He brought us into His kingdom.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.180]   He's our leader.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:50.120]   His ability to lead, His ability to rule, His ability to lead us to God, to show us
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:57.900]   the way to God, necessitated His suffering.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.480]   That's how the verse ends: "The author of their salvation was perfected through His
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.160]   own sufferings."
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:14.380]   So rather than death disqualifying Christ, it qualifies Him.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:22.120]   Hebrews 5:9 says, "He is the source of eternal salvation."
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:29.520]   He became to all who obey Him the source of eternal salvation.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.380]   So the writer of Hebrews is saying, first of all, as you look at the book of Hebrews, you'll see that the word "sacrifice" is a very important word.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.380]   It's a very important word.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.380]   It's a very important word.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.380]   It's a very important word.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:43.920]   But if you look at Christ, you understand that He is our substitute, and He is our sovereign.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:50.080]   He is the author of our salvation, the pioneer of the trailblazer, the one who leads us to
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   God.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.420]   Thirdly, the writer wants us to understand that He is our sanctifier.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:02.280]   Look at verse 11: "For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are sanctified."
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   "For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father."
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.220]   "For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father."
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.540]   He is the one who makes us holy.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.520]   He is the one who makes us righteous.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.380]   Christ is the sanctifier.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.380]   We are the sanctified.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.680]   "Hagiazor" - "to make holy, to hallow."
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:31.980]   And again, over in the tenth chapter of Hebrews, verse 10 and verse 14.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:40.160]   Let's come up with this: "By this will we have been sanctified through the offering
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.640]   of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:55.080]   Then verse 14: "By one offering He perfected for all time those who are sanctified."
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:01.880]   The only way we could be sanctified, made holy, set apart.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:12.440]   Because if our sins were paid for and we were granted a righteousness not our own.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.140]   Do we really share in this holiness?
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:23.580]   Look at verse 11 again: "To this degree that He's not ashamed to call them brothers."
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:31.780]   If you wonder what the level of your holiness is in the eyes of people, you're going to
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   be ashamed.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   You're going to be ashamed of your own holiness.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.780]   You're going to be ashamed of your own holiness.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.780]   You're going to be ashamed of your own holiness.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.780]   You're going to be ashamed of your own holiness.
