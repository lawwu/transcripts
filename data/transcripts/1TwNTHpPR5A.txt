[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   In a recent tweet you wrote, "Christian relationships have this as their goal, to
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.840]   help each other stay satisfied in God." Pastor John, give us some practical ways
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.120]   for how we can do this in our ordinary lives. What does this look like for just
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.040]   an average Christian trying to help another average Christian stay satisfied
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:32.840]   in God? Right. Let me say first why I think that. 1 Corinthians 14, 26 I think
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.200]   says, "Let everything be done for building up." And two chapters later,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.400]   chapter 16, it says, "Let everything be done in love." Now I think building up
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.440]   faith and doing everything for love is virtually the same as encouraging people
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.480]   to be satisfied in God, because I think faith is, in its essence, being satisfied
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.920]   with all that God is for us in Jesus. And loving somebody is helping them be in a
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.200]   situation where they will have the greatest benefit. And Romans 8, 28 says
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520]   that all things work together for those who love God. And so I want to help them
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.040]   love God, because then everything's going to work together for their good. That's
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.880]   what love is, and loving God is being satisfied in God. So that's where that
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.760]   little statement comes from. So here's my how-to. People are satisfied with what
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.760]   they see and taste as satisfying. If they see something as satisfying, they're
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.040]   going to be satisfied in it, and therefore our job is to show God as
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.000]   satisfying. So we need to help people see and taste that God is more
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.560]   satisfying than their television, or their money, or their job, or their
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.120]   relationships. He's more satisfying. And we do that, I think, number one, by speaking
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.040]   the Word of God, or especially the promises of God into their lives. Here's
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.800]   an example. This morning at a prayer meeting, a friend named Dave, there's
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.960]   about a dozen of us there, a friend named Dave is getting on an airplane flying to
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.920]   India tonight to minister to pastors. He's an older guy, and it's a challenge
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.880]   to make that trip. And so we got around Dave, people prayed, and I closed it by
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.040]   saying, "Dave, fear not, for I am with you. Be not dismayed. I am your God. I will
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.400]   help you. I'll strengthen you. I'll hold you up with my righteous right hand. Amen."
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.720]   So I spoke God's--Isaiah 41 10--I spoke it to him, and I hope ringing in his mind
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   right now is, "God's going to help me. God is strong for me. God doesn't want me to
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.320]   be dismayed." So I used the Word of God to try to satisfy him on God's promised
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   help. And then the only other thing I think I would say is, we be satisfied
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.560]   around people. You don't just speak words of satisfaction into people, because if
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.480]   you're living a life of dissatisfaction in God, your whole life is going to
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.360]   contradict those words, and that has less effect. And so a life of joy shows
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.960]   that you're satisfied in God, and a life of service, sacrificial service, shows
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.800]   that you're satisfied in God. So we speak promises of God to reveal his all-
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   satisfying goodness, and we enjoy his promises, thus manifesting in our own
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   freedom from murmuring that he is satisfying, and then we give ourselves to
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.000]   people in a way that shows we don't need them to serve us, because God has
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.120]   served us so well, and we can now give ourselves to serving them. So it seems if
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.840]   we want to serve others to help them stay satisfied in God, the key to that is
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.400]   our own personal disciplines. Yeah, it does. It comes down to whether we taste
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.840]   and see that the Lord is good. I've said to the Church, I've said to
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.320]   pastors, I've said to my wife, "What I want from you, Noel, what I want from my staff
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.080]   is for you to be happy in Jesus. The greatest ministry you can have to me is
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.400]   for you to enjoy Christ." And so I think when we turn that around and say,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.360]   "Now how can I be the greatest blessing to the people around me?" The
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.600]   answer is, get up in the morning, go to the Word of God, and like George Mueller
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.200]   said, "Get your heart happy in God before you meet other people." Thank you, Pastor
