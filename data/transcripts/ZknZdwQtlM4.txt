[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [music playing]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.700]   Hey, Cal, my name is Matthew,
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.340]   and I currently work in information security.
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.280]   This is an industry right now that's rife with burnout,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.600]   and certainly doesn't help that my current employer
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.940]   employs the hyperactive hive mind workflow,
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.340]   which of course has only gotten worse since the pandemic began.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.480]   So as you can imagine, there's a sabbatical on the horizon for me.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.780]   But my question is, once I'm ready to get back to it,
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.720]   what are some tips to find companies
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   that aren't utilizing the hyperactive hive mind?
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.120]   Or maybe the better question would be,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.220]   how do I make sure my next boss is a Cal Newport fan?
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.760]   Thanks.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.620]   Well, yeah, I mean, you certainly should demand that
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.360]   of any boss that you talk to.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.560]   You're like, are you a Cal Newport fan?
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.320]   And if not, may God have mercy on your soul.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.620]   I think that's the way you should talk about it.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660]   Or it's a good question.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.660]   It's a good question because it's the issue here,
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.800]   the boss or the job.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.120]   There's not a lot of people right now
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.860]   that are aggressively trying to bypass the hyperactive
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.760]   hive mind as a specific goal.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.860]   There's more. There's more.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.860]   I have been talking about my latest book,
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.960]   A World Without Email, a lot of C-suite events.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200]   There's definitely a shift going on out there,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.260]   but it's still pretty rare.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.460]   So if you're looking for a boss,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.660]   who's going to talk in terms of how do we avoid unpaid work,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.200]   how do we avoid unnecessary context shifts,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.060]   how do we build out better systems
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.160]   to avoid hyperactive hive mind style ad hoc coordination?
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.720]   There's not that many people talking about it.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.860]   So what you might be looking for is a job description
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.920]   that allows you to bypass the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.260]   And really what you're probably looking for there is autonomy.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.420]   But maybe what you're looking for is a position
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.460]   that is more results oriented,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.960]   that is going to give you the leeway,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.500]   therefore, to essentially structure
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.020]   your own communication protocols.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.720]   All right, I work on this, then this.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.220]   Let's touch base on Mondays.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.360]   I'll deliver by Fridays or whatever it is.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.120]   So having more autonomy in the job gives you the option
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.620]   of engineering a work life
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.580]   that is free from the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.320]   Probably going to be your better bet right now.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.360]   If you're worried about the hive mind, you should be.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.420]   More autonomous type jobs is going to give you the opportunity
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.260]   to have more of that freedom.
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.380]   Your second bet is to look for a boss that is flexible.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.040]   And reasonable. And so what I'm looking for here
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.680]   is someone who maybe they're not thinking about these issues,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.740]   but if you deployed some of the tricks I've talked about,
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.480]   deep to shallow work ratios,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.520]   talking about attention residue and trying to get by it,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.180]   they might change their mind or adjust.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.880]   And you can usually tell that pretty quickly
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.280]   when you talk to a boss if there's a lot of ego involved.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.080]   If there's a lot of I'm really looking around to make sure
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.120]   that no one is threatening my sense of self
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.580]   or threatening my position, if you're seeing that going on,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.020]   that's trouble, but there seems they're reasonable.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.880]   They're confident, but humble.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.140]   They really just want to enable their workers
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.380]   to get the best work done.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.380]   So like a really reasonable, flexible person.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.320]   And then you can probably start to have these careful conversations.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.720]   Here's deep work, here's shallow work, both is important.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.680]   How much deep work should I be doing?
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.120]   Oh, geez, I can't really do that.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.840]   So what changes can we make so we can hit that number we agreed on?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080]   Those type of conversations become pretty reasonable.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.720]   You might literally give them a world without email,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.200]   just so you have a shared vocabulary.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.460]   Hey, this is interesting. I don't agree with all of it.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.760]   But this is interesting. That, by the way, is the trick.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.000]   That is the trick if you want to give anyone advice from a book
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.660]   or an article that you want them to follow and you agree with it.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.700]   Just say, I don't agree with all of it.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.160]   And then boom, they're right on your side.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.120]   And then you have the shared vocabulary, the shared ideas.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.860]   That's not a bad idea. So those are your two options.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.920]   Either lean into autonomy and then build up
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   a really non-hyperactive approach to your work.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.400]   How you communicate with the world and track your efforts.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.860]   Or look for a reasonable boss.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.200]   They might not know anything about the Hive Mind.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.860]   They might be sending emails left and right,
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.620]   but they seem like the type of person that could pretty quickly be open
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.360]   to the idea that maybe there's a better way.
