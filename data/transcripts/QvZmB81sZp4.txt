[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and Pastor
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   John Piper.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   Thanks for making us a part of your day.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.040]   Today is episode number 999.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.840]   And our question today comes from a listener named Dallabore.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.280]   I think that name is Czechoslovakian, Dallabore.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.000]   Pastor John, can you give an example or two on how to pray the scriptures?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.360]   This seems right, but also foreign to me.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.680]   How do I read in such a way that the words become alive and speak to me here and now?
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.600]   How do my feelings reflect or align with the text I'm reading now?
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.360]   Even better, perhaps, would you be willing to pray through a section of scripture with
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.880]   us and for us?
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.120]   I love this question because praying the scriptures is so important in the Christian life.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.580]   If we don't form the habit of praying the scriptures, our prayers will almost certainly
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.040]   degenerate into vain repetitions that eventually revolve entirely around our immediate private
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.460]   concerns rather than God's larger purposes.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.880]   So let me try to help Dallabore see this as less foreign.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.680]   He said it felt foreign to him.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.400]   Let me see if I can help make it feel less foreign.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:31.540]   First, we should notice that the early church prayed the scriptures in Acts 4, 24 following.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.160]   In fact, they explicitly quote scriptures.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.320]   So the threats have been made against them, and it says they lifted their voices together
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.880]   to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.740]   in them," and they're exalting in what they know from God in scripture.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.260]   Then verse 25, "Who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.660]   Spirit, 'Why did the Gentiles rage in the people's plot of vain thing?
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.880]   The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers were gathered together against
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.960]   the Lord and against his anointed,'" etc.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.140]   So that's a quotation from Psalm 2.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.580]   So we know that the early church prayed back to God the very words that God had given them,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.460]   for example, in the Psalms.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.720]   Here's the second thing.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.540]   Don't forget the obvious, namely that many parts of the scripture are prayers.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.820]   So simply to read them is to pray if we're awake, if you're thinking about what you're
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.820]   doing.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.820]   Paul's got numerous prayers that he prays for the people that he's writing his letters
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.820]   to.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.380]   Every time we read those, we should be praying with Paul.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.380]   And a great portion of the Psalms are prayers, and Jesus gave us some prayers.
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.860]   I've used the acronym IOUS from the Psalms to guide how I pray the scriptures.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.220]   It says, "I incline my heart to your testimony," Psalm 119.36.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.940]   "Oh, open my eyes to see wonderful things," Psalm 119.18.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.780]   "You unite my heart to fear your name," Psalm 86.11.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.560]   "S, satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love," Psalm 90.14.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.860]   So the scripture models for us how to pray about reading the scriptures and turning them
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.040]   into prayers.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.160]   And then think about this, which is so obvious.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.300]   The scriptures either tell us something about God and Christ when we're reading so that
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.760]   we can praise him, or they tell us something about what God and Christ and the Holy Spirit
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.180]   have done so that we can thank him and express faith in it, or they tell us what God expects
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.740]   from us so that we can cry out for his help, or they tell us about something we failed
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.260]   to do so that we can confess our sins.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.140]   So it seems to me that virtually all of the Bible is doing one or more of those four things,
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.860]   something about God, something about what he's done, something about what he expects,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.540]   something about how we've failed, so that they naturally lead into praise to God, thanks
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.820]   to God, crying for help to God, and confession of sin to God.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.340]   So one caution here, let's be realistic.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.260]   What we are praying is the meaning of text, not just words.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.140]   This is important.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.380]   So for example, when reading part of the Old Testament history book that takes a whole
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.180]   chapter to tell a story, say about Ahab's wickedness, I just read this morning about
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.740]   Ahab's wickedness, and I also read this morning a whole chapter about Shadrach, Meshach, and
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.900]   Abednego's faith and courage in front of that fiery furnace.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.820]   Now, how do you pray Scripture like that?
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.340]   You don't probably turn every verse into a prayer, because it takes more than one verse
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.380]   to make a point.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.860]   So that's my point.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.860]   We're praying meaning.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.980]   We're not just praying words.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.220]   And so you have to read enough of the Bible to catch the meaning.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.700]   What's the author trying to say here about boldness and courage and faith in Daniel chapter
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.700]   3?
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.660]   And so you might wait three or four minutes of reading and then pause and say, "Oh God,
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:42.740]   make me like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and forgive me for my pansy-like relation
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.580]   to feeling embarrassed or whatever."
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.580]   And same thing with Ahab.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.820]   "Ugh, I just got so mad at him this morning when he took Naboth's vineyard and killed
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.820]   him.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.380]   Oh, and the prophet came and really laid into him and told him we're going to be in big
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.380]   trouble."
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.260]   I mean, that's just, there's so much there to pray about, but you have to read the whole
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.780]   chapter before you can get it right in your head.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.820]   Okay, so Daliber asked me to do this.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.420]   I'm going to close by doing it, and I wanted to do a big section, but I realized it doesn't
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.300]   work that way for me.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.940]   So I'm just going to start with Colossians 2, 6, because I've been in Colossians in my
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:35.220]   devotions, and I'm going to show you how I turn Colossians 2, 6 following into prayer.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.580]   And I'll break it up in two pieces.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.660]   It just turned out that way.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.780]   So here we go.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.540]   This is reading Colossians 2, 6.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:47.460]   "As you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.420]   established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.940]   Yes, Lord Jesus, I have received you, and I do receive you afresh right now this morning.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.060]   I welcome you to take full control of my life.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:13.460]   If I am estranging you in any way, pushing you away at all, show me and help me to kill
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.460]   that sin.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.860]   I want to walk in you, in your power, in your way, in your fellowship.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:27.260]   I dedicate myself to this right now, again, just like I have so many times in the past,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.100]   and I turn from all others.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.800]   Anything else that would compete with you is my closest friend and helper.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.420]   You have given rootedness and foundation to my life.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.420]   Thank you.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:46.060]   I didn't create these roots in you or these great foundation stones of faith.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.220]   You did that.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.220]   Thank you.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.140]   Thank you for sending teachers into my life.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.060]   Thank you for my father and Daniel Fuller and Jonathan Edwards and John Owen and J.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.620]   I. Packer and R.C.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:03.120]   Sproul and dozens of partners in ministry over the years that have exhorted me and kept me
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.660]   on the narrow way.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.980]   Oh, how I thank you, Lord.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.500]   It has all been owing to you.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:17.340]   My reaching you and my walking in you and my rootedness and foundation in you, it's
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.380]   all owing to you.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.140]   All my teachers were from you.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.740]   You are kind and merciful, a mighty God.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.540]   I love you this morning.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:35.200]   And then I keep reading, "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy or
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.840]   empty deceit according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.720]   world and not according to Christ.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.760]   For in him, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily."
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:54.080]   Lord Jesus, I'm not even sure I know what the elemental spirits of the world are.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.040]   But until I find out, I pray that you would protect me from them.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.040]   Your work in me is way more important than my perfect understanding.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.440]   Guard me.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   But I know something of the dangers of human tradition and philosophy.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.480]   I have felt the pull of forces away from you.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:23.120]   Oh, thank you that I am still here right now praying and not over the cliff of unbelief.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.680]   Oh, give me discernment so I can see what is according to Christ.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   Like you said, in the books that I read, in the TV shows that I watch, in the movies,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.240]   in the news, oh Lord, these forces are so strong and I'm so prone to be entertained
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.440]   by ideas and actions that are not according to Christ.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.780]   Have mercy upon me and give me the courage to say no to anything that tends to undermine
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.400]   my fellowship with you and my boldness in witness.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.080]   How could I ever be lured away, Lord?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.780]   For in you is the whole fullness of deity, Paul says.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.880]   The whole fullness of deity dwelling bodily.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.520]   Amazing, amazing, absolutely amazing.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:19.080]   Oh, Christ, help me all day, every day, this very day, to be more amazed at you and your
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:26.720]   fullness of deity that I will never turn away, more amazed than I am at anything else.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.120]   Let my amazement at your fullness of deity spill over at work today.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.960]   Make me a means of others being amazed, I pray in Jesus' name.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   Amen.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   Amen.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.520]   That's a great question, Dallabore.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.320]   Thank you for sending it in to us, and thank you again for making this podcast part of
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.280]   your life and listening in.

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.480]   It's too epic to mention by name, and it's too grand to miss.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
