[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.440]   I think one that I'm excited about, you know, myself is teaching humans.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.840]   I mean, I feel like I consume a lot of educational YouTube content and I wonder, it does seem
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.160]   like you could get a lot of feedback on the quality of teaching.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680]   And even now, I think like for certain topics, I think Chachibitty is incredibly good at
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440]   explaining them to me.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.600]   But then there's a lot of kind of deeper topics that I'd love to learn more about and can't
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.680]   really find a great teacher.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.920]   So I wonder if there's a way to make them teach humans better.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.080]   That's just something I would enjoy as a consumer.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   It seems like it would be a great business if you could make it work.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.800]   The most exciting thing that I feel like the least progress has been made on is what some
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.640]   people sometimes called action transformers or just like transformers or language models
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000]   that can do things in the world.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.160]   It doesn't mean that the language model needs to be trained to use these tools, although
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.520]   that would be useful.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.040]   But sometimes just basic prompt engineering allow you to hook a browser, an interpreter,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.760]   a calculator, a whatever into a language model.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.680]   And yeah, at this point, I would have expected even Chachibitty to have done some of that.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.600]   Like you can easily make it do better math by adding like a Python interpreter into the
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   prompt.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.560]   So I'd be curious, maybe there are some failure modes that I'm not thinking about.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.440]   But I think tool usage, if you think about humans, what made humans special certainly
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.840]   is language and communication.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.400]   But even more than that is our ability to use tools and ability to use tools like what
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.560]   we're doing right now in order to communicate as well.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.200]   And so augmenting language models or tools seems like an important step, but I haven't
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.680]   really seen a lot of progress on it.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.420]   (upbeat music)
