[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.840]   This week we've been looking at what it means to follow God's will.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.680]   On Monday we looked at the key to following God's will.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.600]   Without this in place, following His will will prove, well, it'll prove impossible.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.200]   That was APJ 1807, we covered that.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.360]   And then on Wednesday we put that principle into practice, looking at one example of how
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.880]   to proceed with confidence in a real life decision, knowing that you are in fact following
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640]   God's will.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.920]   That was in APJ 1808 on Wednesday.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.400]   And today we end the week with an email from a listener, and a super busy Christian man.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.440]   How should this man prioritize his life when there isn't time to do everything?
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.200]   That busy man is Steve, and Steve lives in Sacramento, California.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.640]   Dear Pastor John, I work as a physician, and I feel that my work demands too much of my
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.120]   time, much more than most other full-time jobs.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.840]   Because of this, I never seem to have enough time to pray or study God's word.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.400]   I also feel that because of my work, I do not have much time to devote to my family
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   or to church.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.240]   I know that the Bible has numerous passages about the importance of working hard for the
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.160]   Lord, such as Colossians 3.23.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.360]   Whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.000]   And Proverbs 22.29, do you see a man skillful in his work?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.240]   He will stand before kings, he will not stand before obscure men.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.560]   However, I also know that there are numerous passages about the importance of spending
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.900]   time in prayer and studying the word.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.600]   How do I balance the importance for working hard for the Lord while still having enough
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.920]   time for God, spiritual growth, and my family when my job won't allow it?
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.600]   Should I accept that I will have to sacrifice much for my work, consider a career change,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.760]   or do something in between?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   Besides the three possibilities that Steve holds out, there might be another way to think
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.500]   about the challenge he faces, and I'm going to get there in just a minute to suggest that
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.100]   he consider a fourth way.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.360]   I do start with the assumption that except for rare seasons, he really should prioritize
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.040]   daily communion with God in the word and prayer, as well as leading his family in daily focused
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.920]   attention to God's word and in family prayer, and in seeing to it that they are serious
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.760]   participants in their local church.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.240]   And now Steve may listen to me say that and say, "Did you even hear my question?"
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240]   Well, yes.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.320]   Yes, I did.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.160]   So let me clarify one thing, because I was listening carefully, one thing that Steve
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.080]   said twice, and I just want to make sure that before I make my proposal to him that we get
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   this clear, because it really does affect everything we do.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.840]   Twice, he referred to working hard for the Lord.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   That's his exact phrase, working hard for the Lord.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.320]   And when he says that, he is referring to his medical work, not any particularly focused
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.200]   Christian activity like personal evangelism or something like that.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   He's talking about doing a good job in his medical work, which in fact he should do.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.840]   He's basing it on Colossians 3.23, "Whatever you do," like being a doctor, "Whatever you
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.640]   do, work hard or heartily as for the Lord."
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   That's where he gets the phrase.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.200]   So I'm not criticizing the phrase.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.240]   I'm just waving a flag that it could easily be misunderstood.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:01.160]   And I just want to make sure that when Steve or any of us speaks of "working for the Lord,"
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:11.280]   we realize that any true biblical conception of human beings working for the living God
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:22.840]   or the Lord, Jesus, means something fundamentally different than working for a human being.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   Three ways, at least, it's different, radically different.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:36.280]   One, when we work for man, we really do add value to man's business or project or ministry.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.000]   He is the lesser if we do shoddy work or no work.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.480]   He is dependent on us or somebody doing what we do to have something he would not otherwise
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.880]   have.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.760]   Working for God is never like that.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.280]   We don't add anything to God.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.120]   He is not dependent on us.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.720]   He can raise up from stones anything or anybody he wants.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.640]   Second, when we work for man, we really do earn.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.080]   We really do earn just payment.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.360]   Our employer owes us wages.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.760]   Our work for him puts him in our debt.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.240]   He commits a crime if he doesn't pay us.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.080]   That's never, never the case with God.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.160]   We never put God in our debt.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.840]   He never owes us anything.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:50.280]   Third, when we work for man, we rely upon ourselves, not on our boss, for the capacity
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.320]   to do what he hired us to do.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   That's never the case with God.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.680]   We always are dependent on God for life and breath and mind and heart and emotions and
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   intellect and energy and willpower to do what we're called to do.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.920]   The basis for those three distinctions between working for man and working for God is Romans
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.160]   11, 35 to 36.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.080]   Who has given a gift to God that he might be repaid?
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.720]   The answer is nobody.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   Impossible.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.120]   Inconceivable.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.600]   Who has given a gift to God that he might be repaid?
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   Why?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.860]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.160]   To him be glory forever.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   Amen.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   You can't give God anything in order to be repaid because he owns everything, including
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.840]   you.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   You are made by him, sustained by him.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.760]   You exist for his glory.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   The other basis for this distinction between working for man and working for God is 1 Corinthians
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.240]   15, 10, where Paul says, "By the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.880]   And his grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.360]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them."
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.800]   And I don't doubt that Steve could say something like that probably.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.340]   I worked harder than any of them.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.600]   And then Paul adds, and Steve should add, and we should all add, "Though it was not
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.880]   I, but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.520]   We do work hard.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.240]   It's right to work hard as Christians.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:40.560]   And when we work for God, the way we ought to realize that is that we are the receivers
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.500]   when we work for God.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.680]   We are the ones being blessed.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.800]   God is not being enriched by our work for him.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.040]   We are.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.220]   We are not earning anything.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.960]   If we gain an inheritance through our work, which we do, it's all of grace.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.840]   And in the process, we rely on the supply of God's sustaining grace at every moment.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.020]   Working for God and working for man are fundamentally different.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:21.180]   And Paul does call us to work for God in all our working for man, which really is a miraculous,
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:28.100]   amazing, profound transformation of all human life.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.380]   Now against that backdrop, here's my suggestion for Steve to consider.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.700]   It comes mainly from the Bible and partly from my own experience.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:50.160]   In my 70 years of being a Christian, so this year I will mark being a believer for 70 years.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.320]   In my 70 years of being a Christian, one thing I have learned is that from time to time,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:06.220]   no matter how carefully we plan, we come to a point where we are expected to do something.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:12.240]   And we look at the amount of energy that we have and the amount of time we have and the
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.800]   resources we have to do it, and we say, "That's impossible.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.980]   I can't do it."
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.560]   Now sometimes that's true.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.960]   And you simply have to call your supervisor or a friend and tell them, "Find somebody
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   else."
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.040]   But it's not true as often as we think.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   And here's why.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   And I've discovered this over and over.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:50.640]   God can do more in us and through us in five seconds than we can do in five hours without
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.320]   his help.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   Five seconds.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.100]   Yes, he can.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:05.260]   Or same principle, God can do more in us in five hours than we can do in five days.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.280]   Here's one way I've experienced this.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:13.160]   For example, there have been a series of crises in the church and I have spent so much time
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:19.560]   at the hospital and in the home of the bereaved that it is now Saturday evening.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.640]   I have no sermon prepared at all, not even an outline for tomorrow morning.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   I look at my energy, which is spent.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.600]   I look at the time left to me, even if I stay up all night, which is physically not going
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.960]   to work.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.240]   And I say to myself, "This is impossible.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.680]   I don't know what I'm going to do."
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:53.560]   And I get down on my knees and I preach to myself some crazy, wonderful, biblical reality.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:04.020]   God can feed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fish of my time and energy.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.440]   God can make a hundred-year-old man and a barren woman have a baby because the angel
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.320]   says, "Is anything too hard for God?"
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.560]   Jesus said to his disciples, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   possible."
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:29.640]   Paul assures himself, "God calls into existence things that do not exist, like hours in the
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:38.840]   day, to create a sermon that can't be done unless something impossible happens."
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.040]   I preach that to myself.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.320]   I've done this numerous times, and I ask God for a miracle.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:55.400]   And time and again, God has done what looked to me to be impossible.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:03.580]   A sermon outline with true insight into biblical texts, ample application, comes before my
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:12.200]   mind not in five hours as it might ordinarily take, but in five seconds.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:23.120]   It is as if the entire thing was built and then given to me complete in my mind.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:33.040]   I go to my desk at 7 p.m., I ask for the miracle of wakefulness and energy, and at 11 p.m.,
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.440]   a full manuscript is written.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:42.960]   Exhausted, I set the alarm for 4.30 a.m.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.280]   And at 2 p.m. Sunday afternoon, sitting in my chair, I look back on two services complete
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.720]   and wonder, "How did that happen?"
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   In other words, Steve, I'm suggesting that you might experiment with giving yourself
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.640]   to prayer and to your family in a way that you feel is biblically appropriate, and then
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:17.800]   asking for God to create out of nothing what you thought had to be given up at work.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.640]   Now, that's a faith-building testimony.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.480]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.320]   You can do all of that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.760]   Well, we are going to begin next week asking whether or not we should encourage non-Christians
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.240]   to pray for faith.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.680]   Or is a faithless prayer pointless anyways?
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.280]   It's a rather interesting question, and I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.460]   We'll see you back here on Monday for it.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.240]   Have a great weekend.
