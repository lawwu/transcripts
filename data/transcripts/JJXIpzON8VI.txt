[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   A few years back, Pastor John Piper was asked this important question.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.200]   Should married couples consider using birth control pills?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.840]   Why or why not?
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.040]   Some claim it is still, in essence, abortive.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.440]   Here's what Pastor John had to say.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:29.960]   Yeah, well, we did use contraceptives in the early part of our marriage, and my wife's
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.680]   father was a doctor, and we consulted with him about this because the answer is fairly
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.520]   simple to me at one level.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.800]   If it's an abortifacient, if the egg is being fertilized and then being destroyed, it's
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.760]   not right.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.040]   Because I think, I mean, there's just so much we could say here about the beginnings of
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.160]   life and how you understand the soul, but try to keep it short and simple.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   I think a child should be given the benefit of the doubt as to whether he exists or not.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.520]   And when a child, an egg, has been fertilized and all the components there are now physically
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.760]   for a human being, we have every reason to treat it as a human being.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.560]   And so we shouldn't destroy it.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.080]   And if the pill destroys it, we shouldn't use that pill.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.400]   Now, here's where the differences come, I think, because I have had people say to me,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.360]   "You can't be sure," or "The pills all work that way," or "No, they don't."
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   And so I would just say to the families, "Operate on this principle, namely that I'm not going
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.520]   to destroy a fertilized egg."
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.720]   And then do your best, by whatever research and consultation you can, to decide what means
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.880]   of conception control, I'm going to avoid birth control, it doesn't quite say it right,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.040]   conception control you should use.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.280]   Now that's at one level, okay, that's the abortion level.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.080]   There's another whole level to this issue of people saying, "Well, if children are a
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.560]   blessing from the Lord, why would you get in the way, right?
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.800]   Have as many as you can, 15, 20."
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.520]   It'd be like, you know, Susanna Wesley and her parents.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.480]   And there, it's another question, but I'll try to give you my short answer.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.640]   I do think children are an amazing blessing from the Lord.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.720]   I have five, and I'm glad I have five kids.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.160]   And if I had to do over again, I'd have five plus, and I'd start adopting earlier, probably.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   So we had four of the biological kind and then Talitha, and we waited perhaps too long
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   to have Talitha.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.520]   No, we'll say we did.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.800]   So they're a blessing, absolutely a blessing.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:11.240]   To decide when and how many children to have, however, seems to me to be a legitimate kingdom
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   decision because Paul himself said that he wished everybody were single like himself
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.200]   so that they could be utterly devoted to the kingdom.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.120]   And then he paused and said, "But it is not sin to marry."
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.160]   And he said that, that he wished everybody were single even though the Bible says it
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.120]   is not good for man to be alone.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.760]   In other words, marriage is a proper creation ordinance.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.000]   Marry, it's normal, it's right, it's good.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.480]   God ordains it, God plans it.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.120]   And here comes Paul saying, "We should all be single because you'd be really totally
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.480]   devoted to the Lord that way."
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.880]   And that's Paul, I think, enunciating a qualification of creation ordinance with redemption ordinance.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.160]   When the fall happened, death spread and lostness spread.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.520]   And this world isn't the idyllic world where everybody can be married, have lots of kids,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.680]   die, go to heaven, or have no death at all.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.600]   It's now a fallen world.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.840]   It's a world that desperately needs redemption and it needs suffering single people to lay
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.280]   their lives down with no distraction whatsoever to reach certain kinds of people.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.520]   And so Paul waves that flag.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.000]   And if he waves that flag and says, "We cannot marry for the sake of the kingdom," even though
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.440]   the Bible says it's not good for man to be alone, I think the same thing has to do with
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   children.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.360]   Do you see the logic I'm using here?
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.160]   That God says, "He who has his quiver full of them is blessed.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.280]   Children are a blessing from the Lord."
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.400]   And yet, same logic, it may be wise to have two or three or four, not ten, if you're going
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.880]   to go to Guinea.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.520]   In other words, I think kingdom issues, redemption issues, not just natural issues.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.120]   You shouldn't just think in natural issues, like children are naturally good to have.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.560]   Yes, they are.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.720]   But there are other issues going on that should be redemptive.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.080]   Now, one last comment.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.920]   That's a redemptive issue, not a lifestyle, what, dink, double income, no kids, thank
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.520]   you very much, they get in the way kind of attitude.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.000]   So I'll have my 2.1 children to keep the population afloat so the Muslims don't take over.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.360]   But after that, I'm doing my own thing.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.560]   Well, that's not where I am at all.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.440]   I'm saying the criterion are not me and my own little world so that I can have a comfortable
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.840]   life, but rather, what are the kingdom issues at stake here in adoption and the kingdom
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.800]   issues at stake?
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.280]   One other thing comes to my mind.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.000]   I was in Germany when we started having a family.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.360]   It was 1972.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.440]   In 1972, people my age were saying it's a sin to have more than two kids or some were
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.080]   saying it's a sin to have kids because population, blah, blah, blah.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.480]   And I just thought to myself, okay, if you have more than 2.1 kids, you're putting a
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   strain on the planet.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.160]   I said to myself, I don't think so, because the kids I'm going to raise are going to lift
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.520]   a million burdens.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.040]   You, Christian, you got to believe that bringing kids into the world and being brought up in
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.560]   the Lord makes them burden lifters, not burden adders.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.780]   They are in the world to lift the world, to save the world, to love the world.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.860]   You're not just adding dead weight to the world when you bring a child up in the kingdom.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.380]   You're bringing up lovers of people and servants of the world.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.680]   So I'm going on and on here.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.680]   I'll probably just stop.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.160]   I can't even remember what the question was now, but enough on that one.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.320]   That was Pastor John Piper.
