[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Hi, my name is Ashley.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.860]   I'm a wife, mom to five kids, and I'm their teacher.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.760]   We all live in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.660]   I have been a ministry partner with Desiring God for five years.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.800]   You are listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast with Jon Piper.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.960]   Ashley, thank you.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.680]   We're going to talk with Ashley here in just a minute, but first, today's episode.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.120]   If I want to see Jesus, what must change inside of me?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.600]   That's the question Pastor John took up in his sermon in 2011.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.200]   He was preaching on John chapter 7, specifically verses 17 and 18, where Jesus says this, "If
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.720]   anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.260]   I am speaking on my own authority.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.120]   The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but the one who seeks the glory
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.640]   of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood."
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.720]   This text has some incredible implications for our lives, and we will hear that in a
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.320]   sermon clip sent to us by Harley, who lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.800]   It's a really good clip about seeing the glory of Christ and the challenge of self-glory
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.960]   seeking at the same time.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.760]   Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.840]   If we stopped at verse 17, which is where we are right now, didn't go on into verse
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.720]   18, we'd have a general truth.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.040]   It'd be a true truth, but it would be without specifics.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.380]   The general truth would be something like this.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.680]   You will discern that Jesus is a reliable spokesman from God when your will deeply and
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.760]   profoundly comes into sync with God's will.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.220]   That's the true general truth of verse 17.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.520]   You will know Jesus, you will recognize him for who he is as a true spokesman for God
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.260]   when your will is brought into sync with God's will.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.160]   When your willing is in sync with God's, your knowing will be in sync with truth.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.800]   That's the general truth.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.000]   But we're not going to stop at verse 17 because Jesus has much more help to give us here.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.320]   I didn't see this as clearly until I was a pastor at this church in the mid-80s.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.760]   So verse 18, so life-affecting for me in relation to verse 17.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.940]   So let's work with this for a minute.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.560]   The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but the one who seeks the glory
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.160]   of him who sent him is true.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   And in him there is no falsehood or no unrighteousness would be more literal.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.400]   Now remember when the crowds were impressed with Jesus' learning, he said to them in verse
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.980]   16, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me."
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.900]   So he deflected their amazement at his learning to God from self-exaltation.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.780]   He deflects it from self-exaltation to God-exaltation.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.780]   That's what's going on.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.140]   They're coming at him, "You're amazing."
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:41.540]   And he says, "Well, whatever that is, my words are not mine.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.060]   They're God's."
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.900]   So if you want to be amazed, be amazed at God.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.500]   Now he explains in verse 18 that this, what he did in verse 16, this is how you can know
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.340]   he's true.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.780]   The one who seeks his own glory, the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him, that's
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.340]   what he was doing, is true.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.860]   And in him, there is no falsehood.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.780]   So let's put 17 and 18 together now and try to figure out their relationship.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:29.140]   So verse 17 says, "If your will is to do God's will, you can know whether Jesus is a true
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.740]   spokesman for God."
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:40.580]   Verse 18 says, "The way you can know if he's true is whether he's seeking the glory of
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.900]   God above all things."
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900]   Okay.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.460]   Now that sets the stage for a lot of thinking about the relationship between those two verses.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.820]   My will's got to get changed so I can know him.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:03.580]   And the way I know him is that he loves the glory of God more than anything.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.340]   I mean, he's not into self-exaltation, he's into God exaltation.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.340]   That's true.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.260]   That's the mark of truth.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.020]   So what's the relationship now between these two verses?
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.980]   Verse 17, "Willing God's will enables us to know him for who he really is."
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:30.020]   And verse 18, "You can know that he's really true because he's totally committed to exalting
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.020]   his father."
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.700]   And the way I put the two together is this.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:44.520]   Verse 18 describes specifically the deepest change that has to happen in my will in order
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.420]   to see Jesus as who he is.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.780]   The mark of his truth is a passion for God exaltation, not self-exaltation.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.780]   Got that?
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.700]   That's verse 18.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.580]   The mark of his truthfulness is a passion for God exaltation, not self-exaltation.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:10.380]   Now for me to see that and be drawn to it and recognize it as the mark of truth, I've
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.540]   got to be changed.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.700]   That's not the way I am by nature, nor you.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.860]   By nature, we love our own glory.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.780]   We love the praise of man.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.620]   That's the way we're wired.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.020]   To be made much of feels better to us than anything in the world when we come into this
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.500]   world.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:40.900]   And something really profound in the alteration of our wills has to happen for us to begin
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.620]   to enjoy making much of God more than we enjoy being made much of by people.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.940]   Something really profound has to happen, and that's the change being called for in verse
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.620]   17.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.020]   Our wills have to come into sync with God's will, and God's will for his son and for us
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:08.580]   is that we live for his glory, that we deflect to him, that we love to see him made much
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:16.260]   of and we're not addicted any longer to this craving for human praise that governed us.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.540]   That's a super powerful clip.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.740]   The desire for self-praise shrouds Christ to us.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.260]   Therefore, knowing Christ is not just about learning with the mind, but it depends on
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:34.300]   a holistic realignment of our entire being to the priorities of God.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   Man, that was good.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.780]   That was from John Piper's sermon on February 14th, 2011, titled "Willing God's Will as
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.780]   a Way of Knowing Christ's Word."
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.300]   It's a good title.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.660]   "Willing God's Will as a Way of Knowing Christ's Word."
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.100]   You can find it at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.940]   Thank you, Harley, for sharing it with us.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.340]   Speaking of all the sermons and all the resources at Desiring God, before we go, I want you
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.460]   to meet Ashley.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.620]   You heard her voice at the beginning of this episode, and Ashley joins me now over the
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.620]   phone.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.020]   Thank you for spending a little bit of time with us today, Ashley.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.320]   You are a ministry partner with Desiring God.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.920]   You helped make this podcast possible.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.300]   You helped make John Piper's sermons possible and make all of them available to the world
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.380]   free of charge.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.380]   First of all, thank you.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.900]   Thank you for being a part of the team.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.380]   In light of that, take a moment and tell us a little bit about why are you a donor with
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.220]   Desiring God?
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:32.060]   Desiring God is a team of people that are passionate about what they do, and they bring
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:41.060]   a level of excellence combined with the gospel, and they bring it to everybody—moms, businessmen,
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:48.940]   teens, pastors, anybody and everybody that needs encouragement, needs direction, needs
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.500]   to hear from God.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.580]   And they bring it in a way that is easy to chew in multiple formats.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.920]   There's something for everybody there.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.580]   That's our aspiration for sure.
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.580]   Very encouraging.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.500]   Well, we just listened to a John Piper sermon clip.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.980]   I know his preaching has meant a lot to you.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:11.500]   Tell us a little more about your own story and how did you get into DG Resources yourself?
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.540]   I started listening to Desiring God—well, I started listening to Piper's sermon when
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:22.700]   I was a young mom and seemed like I rarely was able to sit into a church service.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.060]   So I started turning on his sermons and would listen while I nursed.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:34.780]   And then years later, I realized that as God gave me more blessings, more children, I started
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:41.100]   to buy into the world's idea of the burden that they were, and I couldn't see past the
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.380]   cultural influence of—I saw the other moms when I was going into Trader Joe's, they
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.240]   were going to business lunches all dressed up, and I was discontent and discouraged and
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.580]   overwhelmed with the daily mundane tasks.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.700]   So it didn't matter what the day held, no matter how well anything went, it was never
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.700]   good enough.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.220]   I didn't have any joy.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:06.060]   And then I started—my husband actually brought home some books that were from Desiring God
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.820]   and some little books.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.200]   I think one of the Christmases, John Piper put out an Advent book, and I just would get
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.900]   up every morning and gobble it up.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.540]   And I realized I was looking—I was desperate for joy.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.780]   And I didn't have—I had every reason to be happy.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.820]   I had plenty of things—a happy family, a happy marriage, but I just wasn't content.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.460]   And I realized that I was looking for it in all the wrong places.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.220]   John Piper's books really pointed me towards happiness in God.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.140]   And it was John Piper's Reformation Sunday sermon.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.220]   And I'm like, "Oh, that's what Jesus did for me."
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:47.060]   I grew up a believer, but I didn't understand the impact, why everybody was so crazy about
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.060]   Jesus.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.220]   Like, I didn't—I understood obeying the law.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.620]   I rested on my own righteousness.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.420]   And I finally saw that it's not me because I can't.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.540]   And I think I was under that weight as a young mom, and I was trying to raise children.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.020]   It's like, "How do I get these little people to do what they're supposed to do?
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.380]   Oh, I can't."
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.060]   And so that has freed me completely.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.100]   That and the sovereignty of God, which I didn't have that theology growing up.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.020]   And so with all of those kids, you can't control them or the outcome of their life
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.020]   or anything.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.900]   It's a false reality.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:26.220]   So that has made me a grace-filled mom, is giving me a different lease on life, and has
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.020]   been completely life-changing.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.580]   So I have desire in God to thank for that.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.500]   And because of that, yeah, I'm like, if somebody else has that opportunity, have that
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.140]   realization to experience, to truly understand the gospel, I absolutely want to give it to
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.900]   every young mom that I can.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.660]   And the best way to do that, the fastest way is to help Zyren God do that, because they
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.500]   have such a further reach than I do.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.860]   I would around my neighborhood and in my little spheres of influence, but I absolutely want
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.380]   every mom to experience that.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.380]   Incredible.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.380]   So speak to somebody who's listening and just now thinking of this, the cost of ministry,
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.060]   making podcasts and sermons and articles and books, and then spreading those resources
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.780]   to moms around the globe.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.780]   It's not cheap.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.780]   It costs a lot of money.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.180]   So what would you say to a listener who's now maybe just thinking for the first time,
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.180]   "Yeah, you know what?
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.540]   I want to join Ashley and become a ministry partner with Zyren God."
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.700]   How would you encourage them?
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.500]   I would encourage them wholeheartedly to give for the work God is doing through Zyren God,
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:34.520]   as they have freely been given, freely they can give, and I believe that they will be
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.540]   truly blessed by blessing somebody else.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:44.420]   The team of Zyren God is some of the happiest, most authentic, humble.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:50.500]   I feel like when I am with the Zyren God team, I see Jesus in the flesh, and that is inspiring.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.900]   It's inspiring to me.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.060]   So I am super grateful for what you guys do.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.740]   I'm privileged to be a part of it.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   Thank you for the opportunity.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.340]   We're honored to have you along, Ashley.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.860]   Thank you so much for your partnership.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.860]   You bet.
