[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   Man, I'm sitting here with Lecrae, bro, appreciate you.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.480]   Absolutely.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.000]   I've been a big fan ever since, I can remember it ever since I was a little kid, you know,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I was listening to your music, I remember my dad put me on ever since I was like 5 to 7.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So to be sitting here with you now, talking about-
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   That's crazy.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Everything's gonna be cool, man.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   That's crazy.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Man, so first off, I just want to ask you, like, so you, you know, you in the celebrity
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   spotlight, you in the rap culture, I'm in the NBA, how do you stay grounded and how
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   do you not let, you know, whether that's social media followers, you know, people treating
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   you like you're a guy at your concert, whatever it is, how do you stay grounded and just be
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   like a regular guy with everything going on?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I think part of it is like making sure I keep some of the people I came up with in my circle,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   you know what I mean?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   People who are not impressed with any, it's like they're not impressed with me.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   They're like, "Man, I know you.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   What are you talking about?"
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Like, you know what I mean?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And it takes some time, take your friends a little time to breathe the air that you're
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   breathing, you know what I mean?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It's kind of like, you know, "What?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   What is going on?"
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   But they still see you as yourself.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So I try to keep those people around me.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Two, I just always remember that nobody wakes up humble, man.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   You don't wake up humble.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   You wake up every day and you got to chase humility.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You know, you got to go after it.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   You don't wake up like, "Man, I feel humble today, boy."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   You know, you wake up like, "I'm the man out here."
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So you got to go pursue humility and be reminded that it's not about you.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And plus, it's a balance, for real.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Especially with me, and I know it's the same over there.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   When you trying to be the best and you still trying to stay humble, it's like you got
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   to have almost like a healthy ego.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   That's a balance you got to...
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   You got to stay humble on the court.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And it's sometimes hard to think like humility when my ego want to tell me like, "No, I'm
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   better than every single person on the floor."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So in your industry, it's so counter Jesus.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And you obviously are...
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You don't consider yourself a Christian rapper per se, but you follow Jesus.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And how in your industry do you do that and not like lose yourself or not kind of adapt
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   to the people you're around?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   How do you stay following Jesus?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And do you have to like put parameters around you?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   What do you do?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Everybody...
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's funny we was talking about this, but it's like, I think everybody is a werewolf.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Like everybody got a full moon.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And when that moon comes out, you're going to turn into an animal.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You got to know what your full moon is.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So let's say, you know, you have an addictive personality and you know if you get to drinking,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   you're going to end up wilding out and going too far.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So obviously your full moon is alcohol.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So it's kind of like if you around it, you know, you might spaz.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So it's like either A, don't put yourself in positions where you're going to be around it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Or B, have somebody with you who knows how you get down and knows when you're around it,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   that it could take you down the wrong path.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And so it's just always trying to be like that.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I mean, obviously as a Christian, I believe that I have a power within me to like, you know,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   a supernatural power to keep me and hold me down and keep me from making bad decisions.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   But I'm still a human.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So, you know, part of it is knowing your own struggles, your own vices.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And then two, count the cost.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   That's what I feel like a lot of people don't do.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   They don't count the cost.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Like you could ruin a movement over a moment.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And that just happens all the time.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You got a whole movement going on and then one moment and it's over.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And it's like, man, it's not worth it.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Nah, that's facts.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   But for me it's like you just said, is it an investment or is it taken away from what I'm trying to do?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   But like you said, every human get in certain moods where it's like if you don't have certain parameters in place,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   you're going to do something messed up.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So for me it's like I know like over time making the same mistakes, going through the same cycles,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I know my vices now at this point.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So it's like I know what I got to stay away from.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Like part of the reason I'm on social media is because I know like for me when I'm feeling down about whatever,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   a game or whatever, I'll run to social media, run to that attention.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Whether that's women's attention or just the approval of others.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   To give me that boost.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And that wasn't really something I was trying to do.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So like for me it's just something I had to take out of my life.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And I'll go back.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Like after a while I'll get off of it, get back on it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And it's cool for a little bit, but then like it creeps back in.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It creeps back up.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And to me social media has like a lot to do with the problems in this world.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And it's tough because like it can be a positive thing.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   For sure.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   But like you said it's an investment for me.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Like I know myself.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It's just one of my downfalls.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   A lot of people's man.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Like social media is rough because you know what I mean?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's kind of like this false sense of identity for a lot of folks.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Myself included, you know what I mean?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So you got to fight against that all the time.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I definitely know what you mean.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And going off of identity, I was telling her before we talked,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   your song "Identity" and your "Rebel" album,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   one of my favorite songs you talk about.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You go back?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   My ears go back.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   No, your "Rebel" album, that's my favorite album you ever dropped.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And that song you just talk about how you try not to find your identity
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   in the things or your career, your house, your success, whatever it is.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   You try to find your identity in God.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But that's so much easier said than done,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   especially like when you're in the career or you're in these moments.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It's hard not to find your identity.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   For me, I know it is.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   When I have a bad game and I see how down I get,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I know I'm not really finding my identity in God.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   A lot of times finding it through basketball.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And it's hard because that's all I do all day.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But how do you think practically you can find your identity in God?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Practically, a lot of it comes down to spending time with God.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Because the more time you spend with somebody,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   the more their perspective informs you.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You feel closer to them, more connected to them.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The less time I spend with God--and when I say spending time with God,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   it's just being still, being quiet, prayer, reading my Bible,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   whatever that looks like.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   The less time I spend with them, the easier it is for me to believe lies.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   The more time you spend with truth, the harder it is to believe lies.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It's like when I'm spending more time with God,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   then it's harder to believe the lies.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's easier to believe, "Oh, yeah, this is where my purpose is.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   This is where my worth is."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   For me, some little things that I do, I take a dry erase marker sometimes,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and I'll write verses on my mirror so when I wake up in the morning,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I see it and I'm reminded.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Just like, "All right, I'm God's workmanship creator for things he planned."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   So it's like, "All right, this is where my identity lies."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Because like you said, everybody's on your head.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Boy, people have been on my head for years about every little thing,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and it weighs on you.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   People treat you like a product instead of a person,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and you have to remember, "You know what, man?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I'm not who they say I am. I'm who God says I am,"
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and just remind myself of that.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yeah, that's a big time because like you just were saying,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   it's about the input you put in.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I know me, and I know a lot of people.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's really hard to will yourself to be a good person,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   to will yourself to grow every day.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But the more you can fill yourself up with good stuff,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   the more you can spend time in the Word,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   spend time around good people, have good conversations,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   that's the only way it will overflow out of you.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   For so long for me, I was just trying to will myself
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   to make the right decisions and will myself not to do certain things.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   But as a Christian, your life is kind of like you're always guilty
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   because you're not going to be perfect,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and when you're trying to will yourself to be better, better, better,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   then you trip, then you just back down in the dumps.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   That was a big problem for me for a long time.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   That's kind of how I shaped my faith.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It was a wrong perception of God because it was me trying to just not do stuff.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Instead of spend time with Him, learn to love Him,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   and then do stuff out of that.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   You talk a lot about how you lost your religion and you found your faith,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and I feel like that's something that I'm in the process of doing.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   What do you really mean when you say you lost your religion and found your faith?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Religion, like you said, is when you are following rules
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   in order to be accepted by God and accepted by people.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Right.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Faith is what it takes--sorry, I'm popping up on my phone.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   No, faith is when you have to believe that there's nothing you could do
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   to make God love you more or make God love you less.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   The work has already been done.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And so I think about it like this.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It's like I went on a cruise one time, my first cruise I ever went on,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   and before I got on the cruise, I was excited.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I was like, "Man, we're going to be on this cruise for five days."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And then I started thinking to myself, "All right, I got to pack for this--
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   five days on this boat in the middle of the water."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And I didn't know any better, so I'm packing snacks, all kind of stuff,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   because I'm like, "You know how the food might be?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I don't know what the food situation is going to be like."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I'm just bringing all this stuff.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And they was like, "You know you don't got to bring all this food."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And I was like, "What you mean?"
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   They said, "All the food is covered on the cost of the cruise.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It's already been paid for."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And I think that's how we treat our faith is we try to add
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   all this extra stuff to it instead of realizing,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   "No, the price has been paid. Go enjoy the food.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Be free to enjoy what's going on. Stop trying to earn it.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Stop trying to build up."
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And because you're an athlete, that's all you know.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   You know if I work hard, I get results.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But it's different with God.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   It's more like you get to work hard.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   You get to practice. You get to enjoy Him
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   instead of like you have to.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   For sure. I feel like, too, like Christians,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   that makes a lot of Christians...
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   From the outside looking in, I feel like people really think
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Christians could be the most miserable people
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   because they're not living in freedom.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's like they're in chains, but they're trying to do good,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   but they're not necessarily doing good.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So it makes this perception like Christians
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   is just like always feeling guilty, always down.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And honestly, that could be the truth.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And I think that's why the Bible is saying
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   it's better to be hot or cold,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   either be all the way in the world doing everything the world do
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and be guilt-free, or be all the way for Jesus.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   But I don't think by "all the way for Jesus,"
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   that means don't do anything wrong.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It just means like...
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   My dad brought up a quote the other day.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It was a quote of someone that said,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   "Love God and then do what you want."
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   But, like, really love God,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and that's going to change what you want to do.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Big facts. Big facts.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   When you start with that,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   everything else after that, it makes sense.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Love God, love your neighbour, and do whatever else you want.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Because if you're loving God,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   you're not going to do stupid stuff
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   that's stupid and harmful to you.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   You're going to do things that are helpful.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   So how do you think the message in your music has changed
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   as you've kind of come to this reality?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Like, early on in your faith, you know, you talk about, like,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   you was probably more like me in the beginning.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And now it's more you've come to this realisation.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   You just dropped this Restoration album.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   You talk about that.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   How do you think that that has changed through your music?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Like, what was you really talking about early on,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   and now what are you more trying to focus on?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I think early on, man, you know, I was real self-righteous.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Just real, like, look at how I move.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Look at how I do this. I don't do that. I don't do this.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I don't do that. I don't do this.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do...
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You know, it was all about what I didn't do.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Look at me. You know what I mean?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Look at how I'm trying to follow God.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And even though I was trying to encourage people
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   to push and to fight, you know,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   to be what God created them to be,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I think what I didn't understand
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   is that I was more devoted to my devotion
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   than how devoted God was to me, you know what I mean?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So now I'm not so much, like, telling people to get like me.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I'm telling people, "Look, I understand it's hard.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   "I understand that it's tough,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   "but you got to keep going, keep taking steps.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   "God is going to be with you in that whole process."
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Instead of, like, trying to will yourself to do it,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   like you were saying, it's leaning on God
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   to be able to get you through.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Because that's another thing I don't want.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   When you have that culture of, like, get like me,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   when I'm making them type of songs, people love it,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   but then when they mess up, they don't want to come around you
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   'cause they feel like, "Oh, y'all going to look down on me.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   "I don't want to... I can't be around them."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   But when you write from the standpoint of, like,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   "Hey, you know, there's mercy, there's goodness,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   "and there's another way to live,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   "and if you fail, it's OK, get back up,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   "'cause there's another opportunity for you to keep...
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   "You know, restoration is available to you."
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And that's what I always want people to understand is, like,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   you know, God is always available for your restoration.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   If you really want to change, He's here,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   no matter how bad it has been in the past.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   So I think that's how the music has changed.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   'Cause I've made a lot of mistakes, too.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   When you make some mistakes, then it's like, "All right, yeah."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Right.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   You know what I mean? Like, "All right."
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   - That's a fact. - Yeah.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Yeah, that's a fact. So how do you relate to people?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   When you're in this world of, like, living in the rap world,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   you got a lot of friends who are living probably, like,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   way different than you,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   how do you relate to them to a point
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   so that you can be an influence to them, but also stand out?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   So, like, I know, you know, some pastors
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   or some people that want to reach certain people
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   that are living way different,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   but you want to, like, blend in a little bit,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   but still differ from them.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   - Yeah. - How do you do that?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   You know what's funny, man?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   People make it rocket science sometimes.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   I think what folks don't understand is
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   people will respect you for being yourself.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   People think, like, you know,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   everybody got, like, a vegan friend,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and it's like, you know they vegan.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   It doesn't mean you're not going to hang with them no more.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   You just know when y'all go out, it's like,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   "Oh, yeah, they ain't going to eat no burger."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   They might got Impossible Burgers, though, bro,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   if you want to get an Impossible Burger or something like that.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But they're not hiding the fact that they vegan.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   This is what they about,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and this is how they move and they function.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And I think that's where my freedom was found,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   is I'm going to be myself, you know?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I'll be around you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   "Oh, man, my bad, I'm smoking."
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Smoke? I'm not going to, you know what I mean?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And I'm not going to judge you.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   I'm not going to condemn you for what you're doing,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   because at the end of the day,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   I'm not here to point out all the little things
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   that you're doing wrong.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I'm here to be a picture of how good and loving God is,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   you know what I'm saying,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and how my relationship with him
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   has made some things better in my life, you know,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   a different look at peace and joy.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So that's really...
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I'm just there to be a light in those dark places.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   So when I'm around folks, man, I just try to be real.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I don't try to be holier-than-thou.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I don't try to do any of that stuff.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   You know, I was in a studio with, you know,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   lots of rappers that people would be like,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "What you doing hanging out with these folks?"
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   But that's why they love me,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   is because I don't mind being around them.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   You think early on, like, with that,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   you had to be careful about how much time
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   you spent early on in your walk with God,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   because you got to really be like,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I'm not hung with the sinners,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   but it's because his faith was so strong.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   But early on, like, in someone's faith walk,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   they might have got to be careful
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   being around those dark places,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   because it might bring them down.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   You think, like, you evolved to that spot
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   where nothing can shake you no more?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Or you think it was always like...
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Nah, nah, nah, nah. I had to...
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   You know, you grow there. You grow into that space.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Like, early on, I made a lot of mistakes
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   because I thought, like you said, I was invincible.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Like, I can do this.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   But now everybody's saying, man,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   they see you on the court, and they're like,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   "I can do that." You know, they're watching you.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   They don't know how many hours of practice you put in.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   They don't know how many shots you get up
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   when nobody's looking.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   They don't know how many plays you're memorizing.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   They don't know all of that.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   So a lot of times, people are like,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   "Oh, yeah, I could go to the BET Awards.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   I'd be straighter. I could go hang with these people."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And it's like, you don't know how much,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   you know, meditation and prayer I done put in,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   how much studying of my word I done put in,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   how much meditation I done put in,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   how much prayer I done put in,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   God put it on the earth, so like,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   as long as I'm not addicted to it
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and I'm moderate in it,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   what do you think of it?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Or like, even drinking.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I know people that use drinking
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   way too far, and they take it way too far.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But like, you know,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   for me, it's not that.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   But like, all in all, what do you think
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   about the drinking and the smoking?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You know, I gotta, I mean,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   here's the thing.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   It first comes down to,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   are you,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   are you a Christian, right?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   'Cause if you're not, then there's different,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   then you following a whole different set
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   of beliefs and views and values.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So if you say, yeah, I'm a follower
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   of Jesus. Okay, cool.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So then I can use the Bible
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   as our kind of
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   north star, in a sense, to talk
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   about stuff. Cool, alright, bet.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   So let's look at that then
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and see what that says for us.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And what I
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   understand is, you know, obviously,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   the Lord tells us to be sober-minded.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And the idea of being sober-minded
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   is just, man, are you always
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   ready to
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   withstand the darts the enemy's
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   going to throw at you? 'Cause if you're drunk, you're not
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   ready. You know what I'm saying?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You're not ready. Them darts is coming and you
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   out of there, champ.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So it's, are you sober-minded?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And, you know,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   all throughout the Bible it uses,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   you know, Jesus turned water into wine.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It doesn't condemn alcohol. It condemns
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   drunkenness, you know what I mean?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So it comes down to you
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   being able to
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   follow your convictions 'cause you got your own
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   internal convictions about. And if you
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   are doing something you feel is wrong,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   then you sinning against your own conscience
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   in that moment. 'Cause you know you feel convicted
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   about it, so you wrong.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   You know, and Romans 14 talks about,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   you know, some people are weaker in this area,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   some people are not in this area.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   So when it comes to
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   smoking,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I feel like
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   anything that enhances your
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   ability to be
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   a light and to represent the
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   kingdom is,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I don't have a problem with it, right? If it's enhancing
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   your ability to be a light and it's not
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   a detriment, you know what I mean?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's not tearing you down, hurting you, hurting
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   other people. It's not illegal.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Cool.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But at the same time, you gotta have your own
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   barrier. You gotta know where that line is
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   drawn for you. I personally,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I'm not a smoker.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   You know what I'm saying? But I have
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   friends who are. I have friends who are Christians
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and they smoke.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   That's not a line I dabble with because
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I don't know. Like,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   alcohol, I know one shot, alright, two
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   shots, and then it's a wrap. Like, now
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I may be going past my limit.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Smoking, it's like,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I don't know how much took me past the limit.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   You know what I'm saying? So, but
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   that's me. That's where I'm at with it. But at the end of the day,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I think you just gotta abide by your conscience.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And then, I don't try to look for
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   how far I can go
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   before I'm too far. I try to look for how close
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   to God I can be. And that's what I always try
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   to strive for. Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   That's the ideal way. See how close you can be.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   But I like what you said about
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   the conscience because I've had this conversation with a lot of people
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and I think, like,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   there's a lot of things in the Bible that's black
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and white. Like, you can do this, you shouldn't
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   do this. And there's, like, there is some
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   gray areas. And, like,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   as Christians, you might have a conviction
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   that someone else don't have.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And I don't really,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   I don't like when, like, Christians
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   try to judge other people because,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   just because their convictions are different than another Christian's.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Because, like, people
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   struggle with different things. We talked about this before we
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   started the interview. But just, like,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   knowing yourself and knowing your own vices,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   what you would run to when you're feeling,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   like, down or something.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Like, if that's something you would run to,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I would probably stay away from it because,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   but, like, if it's just something that you're using
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   in moderation, like, I feel like
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   it's good. Moderation is key, baby.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Food, alcohol,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   sugar,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   moderation, baby.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Shrooms, LSD. I don't know.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   That's eight hours, you're gone.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   You're out of there for eight hours. I don't know. Can you replicate
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   your kingdom? I just
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   want to try it one time. I'm cool.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I'm actually really good on that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I don't want nothing controlling me
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   for eight hours. I'm good.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Let me off the bus. Let me off the bus.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I feel you on that.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Man, last thing I really
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   want to talk about was just your,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   like, how
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   big you are into, like, the social justice
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and, like, that seems like that's something
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   you're really into right now and pushing for right now.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   How, what do you see
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   in our world is the
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   biggest way that you can help and the biggest
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   issues in our world right now
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   in that area? Yeah. Well,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   one is,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   man, we don't listen to each other, you know
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   what I'm saying? At all. We don't listen to each other. We don't hear
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   each other's stories. We don't try to
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   see where other people are coming from. We don't try
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   to learn. We just want to talk
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   over everybody. That's why I don't like Clubhouse,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   you know, the app. I heard about that.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   What is that app? It's basically like, it's social media
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   but everybody's talking, you know what I mean?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So instead of, like, typing or posting
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   pictures, you just talk. And it was dope
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   at first, but then everybody just started talking over each other.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Nobody's listening to each other. Everybody an expert
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   in their own little spaces. And so
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   if you're a learner, you
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   know you can learn from people and learn from
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   their perspectives. But if you think you've got
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   it all figured out, of course
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   we're going to end up like this.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Because now what you're saying is
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I have nothing to learn from you, you know
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   what I mean? So even
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   people I really disagree with, I
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   just like to know why they believe
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   what they believe. You're just trying to learn.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Yeah, exactly. So I can say, "Okay,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I see where you're coming from. Have
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   you considered this?" You know what I mean?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And I think that creates a lot of
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   problems. And so
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   you know,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   when we don't listen to each other,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   we're not learning from each other
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   and we're not learning what different issues are
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and different problems. And when you're on the top, you know
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   what I mean? Like, when you don't need
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   people, and when I say need, like
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I'm making money.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I live in a nice
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   neighborhood, whatever.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I don't need
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   the people in the hood or
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   in the projects. I don't need y'all. So I'm not
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   listening to y'all. Y'all don't have nothing to offer me.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Y'all need to listen to me. I'm the one with the
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   money and the nice house. And that's where the problem comes.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Because they're trying to tell
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   me what's going on in their world
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   and I'm saying,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   "I know better than y'all. Y'all don't know what's going on."
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And I think that just creates a lot of tension.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   You know what I'm saying? With race
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   and ethnicities too. Nobody's listening.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   We're trying to tell y'all this.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   It's like you can't have an opinion no more.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Nope. Or they'll cancel you.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   You canceled yourself. You took yourself off social media.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Go right on, bro.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Man, speaking of that,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I remember
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   that situation with George
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Floyd and
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   how that went down and how
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   heartbreaking that was. And I remember seeing that video
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   and being in tears, being
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   devastated. And I remember tweeting,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   there was three tweets.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   The first one
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   was just like, "Man, that's murder.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   You witnessed murder." The second one
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   was like, "That's
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   heartbreaking. It brings tears to my eyes watching that
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   video." Something else. And then the third
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   one was like, you know, because
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   when you see stuff like that, you know, you go
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   to the barber shop or wherever where there's a lot of black
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   people and then they're all talking about that.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   It can cause black people, when you
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   see stuff like that, to have a hatred towards
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   white people in a way.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   When I see stuff like that,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   that's kind of what starts to
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   creep into your head no matter how hard you try
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   not for it to. And so then I
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   remember thinking like, "Man, but what would
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   God say?" And I remember the third tweet I tweeted
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   was, it was
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   you know, as much as you pray for like
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   George's family and how heartbreaking it is,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   also pray that God would change the
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   hearts of these police officers
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   that would even have the
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   intent to do that. And you know, that tweet,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   the first for a little while,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   you know, it was just my followers that seen it. And it was like
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   like, "Man, that's big time, bro. Good
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   perspective." Then some people
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   saw it and were like, "Hold on, he's talking about pray for
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   the officers that just murdered this dude?"
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Man, like, when I
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   went there, then some famous people started
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   having backlash on it. And then after
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   that, everybody talking crazy.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And you know, everybody saw it and people was really
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   hurt by it and not understanding
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   what I said.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And not understanding the tweets that I had tweeted
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   prior to that.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And you know, that was
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   hurtful for me just because
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   of how much that stuff
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   affects me and what I see when I
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   see that video. But I just remember you hitting
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   me. Do you kind of remember
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   like what your thoughts was in that situation?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   What you were thinking? Some of it.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I remember saying
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   there's a few things that come to mind.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   One is just like, man, you know,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   it was the timing.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   You know what I'm saying? It was just the timing.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And you know, everyone's grieving George
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Floyd's death.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And sometimes truth
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   isn't received when it's received
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   in a time
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   where people aren't prepared to receive that.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   You know what I'm saying? And so it's kind of like
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   you know, if your mom
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   or dad or
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   cousin
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   got locked up and you're sad
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   about it, but they really committed the crime.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And someone's like, yeah.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   You're not trying to hear nothing.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   It's like, you know,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   they're locked up.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   It was more of the timing.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   You know, obviously
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   social media
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   is the place where people are going to misunderstand you.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And especially you coming from
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   a Christian perspective
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   where love is our
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   North Star, it's really difficult.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Because when you try to promote
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   love, some people hear acceptance.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It's like, so you're saying,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   hey man, love your enemy. So I need to accept what they did
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   to me? No, we're not saying accept it.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   We're saying love.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Love doesn't tolerate
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   injustice or
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   accept it. Love
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   still hates
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   what's done, but it still
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   tries to
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   flesh out
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   what it looks like to be consistent.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   No, I definitely
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   like the timing thing, I definitely was
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   feeling that. If I could take it back, it probably would
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   have been based on the timing. But at the time it was
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   like, it was
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   to my followers. You know what I'm saying?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It wasn't like, I didn't know the whole
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   world was going to see that, Joanne.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Oh, they did.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   That's why I called you, because I was like, man,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   everybody's just going to say something
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   and no one's going to... I hate that.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Just talk to me. Talk to me.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Don't come at me on social media.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Yeah, so
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   sometimes in Jesus'
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   way, this happened back then, and I feel like
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   it's even more prevalent now.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   What Jesus would preach was so
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   counter-cultural to what people thought was
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   right. It was like, he
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   was killed for it. He was killed for the message
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   he was speaking. Even though it was
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   about love, people don't know how to receive
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   that. I feel like that's another thing wrong
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   with the world today.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   People don't even understand.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   It's almost like God
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   said in the end days, good
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   is going to become evil, and evil is going to
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   become good. I feel like we're getting close to that almost.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   So,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   do you see that in this culture
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   today? Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Without a shadow of a doubt. You know, it's just
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   a society now where
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I think
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   we tolerate
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   everything.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   When you tolerate everything, some things are
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   not good. You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   They're wrong.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   When it's wrong,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   when it becomes wrong
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   to put your foot down
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   and say, "I don't agree with this,"
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   then, like you
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   were saying, evil becomes good, and good
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   becomes evil. So, tolerating nonsense
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   or foolishness becomes good.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And then
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   putting your
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   foot down and saying, "Hey, we don't do
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   this," becomes bad.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And so, that's
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   a unique place, man, where
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   I think
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   for me,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   there's a lot of things that
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   obviously we all got a lot of learning to do, and
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   unlearning to do. So, I'm always trying to
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   learn and unlearn. But
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I can follow a person
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   even-- Like, when people disagree with me,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I can follow
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   a person who stands by what they believe
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   in. At least I know what you stand on.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   You know what I mean? And so,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   I'm like, "All right, cool. Now, can we have
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   a discussion about it?" Because somebody
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   may be looking at things from the wrong
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   perspective.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And when we can do that,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   then I'm like, "Good, but we not able to do that no more,"
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   which makes me feel like, "All right, well, here we go."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   We get into that time period,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   wars, rumors of wars.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I mean, Christ said--
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   He said when He was alive
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   that
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   they were in the
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   last days, and the last days are coming.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   So, I think it's just a long time period
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   of us being in
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   the last days. I don't know when
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   He's coming back, but I do know
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   it's been consistent.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It's been consistent, but
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   it ain't no way we're going to be here for more than, what,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   a hundred years. I think
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   it's going to happen in our generation, to be honest.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Well, we got some work to do then.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   You know what I'm saying? We got some
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   promotion to do.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   We need to start promoting this kingdom.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   How much of, you know,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   that, you know,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   good looked at as bad
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   and bad looked at as good do you think comes from, like,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   the music industry and the rap culture?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   You know, like, multiple women now.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   If you were a dude who only talked to one girl
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and you only got one girl and you ain't cheating on her now,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   you kind of looked at it like a square these days.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Or like, you know, if you ain't doing this,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   now you looked at it as soft.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   If you ain't, you know, promoting violence or whatever,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   how much of that do you think?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Because you in the music culture, how much
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   do you think stems from that?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Art imitates life
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   that imitates art.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So I think there are some parts
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   of it that are real,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   but then when people learn,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "Oh, if I rap about this,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I make money, so I'm going to
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   talk about it a lot."
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And then the world says,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   "Oh, well,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I need to imitate what I just saw
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   more." You know what I mean?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   So I think some of it is real
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   and then music
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   talks about what's real, but then
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   when music does it, it glorifies it and then people
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   really start imitating.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Exactly. You know what I mean?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   So I think that's really what happens and I see it
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   all the time where,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I mean, even like myself,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   people just
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   see something and they want that. Like for me,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   being a Christian and then
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   breaking all these barriers and, "Oh, you doing
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   BET and you winning the Grammy."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   First rapper to do all this
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   stuff. A lot of young Christians
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   who rap saw
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   that and that's what they went after.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Just the awards and the limelight
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and the fame and stuff and not
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   the heart that went behind it.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So yeah,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   you saw it all happen and you was like,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   "I need to be a part of it. I need to do this."
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And I think that's what happens a lot of times too.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It's like some kid who never thought about being a
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   gang member, never thought about none of that stuff,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   is listening to some Chicago Drills dudes
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and they like, "Yeah,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   that's what I'm on."
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And plus, it's way harder to make it
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   the way you made it than it is
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   to rap about what everybody else is rapping about.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Way harder, bro.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I'll be jealous. I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I've been telling people like,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   "You're so lyrically genius.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   If you was a secular artist, you would be
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   all the way up there."
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Bro, it's so easy to get in the studio
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and freestyle
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   about anything.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Oh my gosh, I could go for hours.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I could make 50 million songs
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   but to have to like, "Alright,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I'm going to say this and I'm going to think through this."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   It's work, man.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Is there any pressure that come with when people
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   think of
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Christian
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   rap, which you don't really like being put
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   in a particular category.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Is there pressure being like,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   "Dude, you..."
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   When they think of Lecrae,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   is there pressure to come with that?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   It's pressure at first
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and then you own it.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   At first it's pressure, then you own it
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   and it becomes, "This is what I do."
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   It just becomes, "This is what I do."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   So let me make sure
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   y'all get a good representation of this.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   You know what I mean? Because it's what I do.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   It's like being on a court.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Is it pressure being at the
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   highest level of basketball?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And it's like, "Sure."
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   But then it's like, "Man, I've been
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   doing it so long.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I've been playing so many games.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   This is what I do now."
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You ain't nervous no more.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   You said that in your music. You said, "I've been doing it so long."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   I don't get nervous.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   That's facts.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I got one last question for you.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Why you
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   choose Jesus? Was there ever a period
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   in time where you wanted to
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   explore your faith?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I went through this probably a year
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   and a half, two years ago, where I didn't know what I
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   believed. I didn't know what I wanted to believe.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Why you chose Jesus instead
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   of anyone else?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I'm definitely a thinker
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and I remember
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   studying world religions
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   before I was
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   landing my plane on the Christian
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   faith. And I've had rocky roads and doubts and
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   all that type of stuff in the journey, but really
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   what solidified it for me was
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   as I looked at the
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   world's religions, and you can go through them all,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   which I did.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I went through all the ones that I knew about anyway.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   When you talk to people
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and I have good friends
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   who believe, who are
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Buddhists, who are Muslim, who are
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   agnostic. I got some Rastafarian
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   friends. When you talk
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   to them all and you say, "Man, how
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   do I
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   get to
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   God? How do I get to
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Him?"
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   All of them will tell you
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   there's something you've got to do.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   There's something you've got to do.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   There's
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   you've got to do this, and then do this, and then do
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   this, or you've got to do this. It's a performance. Exactly.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   You've got to perform.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And I said, "Man, that's just hard."
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Who knows? No one knows.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Everyone's dying like this.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   You know what I mean? I hope I get there.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Jesus is the only one that said,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   "All you've got to do is trust me."
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I performed already.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   So every other faith,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   you've got to reach up
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   to try to get to God, but
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Christ reaches down
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and pulls you up to God.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I was like, "I'm done," because I know I'll never be perfect.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Man, you know how messed up you are, right?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   That's what it was for me, too. I know how
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   jacked up I am, so if every
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   other religion you've got to perform and do enough
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   to make it, Christianity is the only one where it's
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   like, "Nah, someone came and saved you."
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   That's the one I'm
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   rocking with. I'm rocking with it.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And Christianity has almost become now, like we
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   talked about this earlier, but it's almost become
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   in this day and age, a little performance
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   based. You know what I'm saying? But
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   real Christianity, I mean,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   it's
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   just about faith and believing.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Not that weirdo stuff you
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   see on TV, okay? Not that weirdo
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   stuff. We're talking authentic.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Sometimes I'll just be saying, "I'm
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   a believer." I don't even want to say, "I'm a Christian," because
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   people are like, "Oh, you're like them."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   I'm a believer.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   In this day and age, some people just talk about God, too.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   They don't even mention what God. They say
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   they believe in God. That's true.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Or, I feel like a big movement
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   these days, too, is
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   the New Age type of religion, where you're
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   kind of like almost your own God, like you're
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   trying to become your own. Giving the universe all
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   the credit. Yeah.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I ain't gonna lie.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I had dabbled in it a little bit. I was
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   going to the crystal store to get my little crystals.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   I heard they was going like
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   whatever.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   That, too,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   it's like, why
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   make yourself your own God?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Trying to will yourself
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   to be better.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I think God puts all
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   those things here for us to
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   enjoy,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and they're useful in their own ways.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You know what I mean? I agree with you.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   As far as meditation
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   or yoga, all those things can be
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   beneficial, but when it becomes
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   God, then
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   we're in trouble. I think even
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   like you said, even astrology
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   or something, there might really be some truth
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   to them zodiac signs or
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   a story told in the stars or whatever,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   but then when that becomes your basis for
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   living in faith, that's when it
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   becomes dangerous. Right. I agree with you
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   100%. Yes, indeed.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Well, I appreciate you. This has been dope.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   We talked about a lot of stuff, and I appreciate
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   you, my guy. My guy. Respect.
