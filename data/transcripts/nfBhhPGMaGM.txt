[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   Man, I'm sitting here with Lecrae bro, appreciate you.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.840]   I've been a big fan ever since, I can remember ever since I was a little kid.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.400]   You know, I was listening to your music, I remember my dad put me on.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.000]   Ever since I was like five to seven.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So to be sitting here with you now, talking about.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.600]   That's crazy.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200]   Everything's going to be cool, man.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   That's crazy.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.600]   >> Yeah, so first off, I just want to ask you, so you in the celebrity spotlight.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.240]   You in the rap culture, I'm in the NBA.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.480]   How do you stay grounded and how do you not let,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.920]   whether that's social media followers, people treating you like you're a guy at
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   your concert, whatever it is.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.280]   How do you stay grounded and just be like a regular guy with everything going on?
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.120]   >> Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.360]   I think part of it is making sure I keep some of the people I came up with
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.720]   in my circle, you know what I mean?
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.920]   Like people who are not impressed with any, it's like they're not impressed with me.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.720]   They're like, man, I know you, what are you talking about, you know what I mean?
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.400]   It takes some time,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.600]   take your friends a little time to breathe the air that you're breathing.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.200]   It's kind of like, what is going on?
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.400]   But they still see you as yourself.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.000]   So I try to keep those people around me.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.200]   Two, I just always remember that nobody wakes up humble, man.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.160]   You don't wake up humble.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   You wake up every day and you gotta chase humility.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.760]   You gotta go after it.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.920]   You don't wake up like, man, I feel humble today, boy, I'm just, you know?
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.960]   You wake up like, I'm the man out here, you know what I mean?
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.320]   So you have to go pursue humility and be reminded that.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.800]   >> And plus, it's a balance for real, especially with me.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.040]   And I know it's the same over there.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.520]   When you're trying to be the best and you're still trying to stay humble,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.960]   it's like you gotta have almost a healthy ego.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.680]   That's a balance you gotta, I get on the court.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.840]   And it's sometimes hard to think humility when my ego wanna tell me no,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   I'm better than every single person on the floor, you know what I'm saying?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.200]   So, in your industry, it's so counter Jesus.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.760]   And you obviously are, you don't consider yourself a Christian rapper per se,
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.400]   but you follow Jesus.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.720]   And how in your industry do you do that and
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.960]   not lose yourself or not kind of adapt to the people you're around?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.360]   How do you stay following Jesus?
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.800]   And do you have to put parameters around you?
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.840]   What do you do?
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.440]   >> Yeah, everybody, it's funny, we was talking about this, but
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.000]   it's like, I think everybody is a werewolf, you know what I mean?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.560]   Everybody got a full moon.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.200]   And when that moon comes out, you're gonna turn into an animal.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.560]   You gotta know what your full moon is.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.160]   So let's say, you have an addictive personality and
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.880]   you know if you get to drinking, you're gonna end up wilding out and going too far.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.080]   So obviously, your full moon is alcohol.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.440]   So it's kind of like if you're around it, you might spaz.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.960]   So it's like either A, don't put yourself in positions where you're gonna be around
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.600]   it, or B, have somebody with you who knows how you get down and
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.040]   knows when you're around it that it could take you down the wrong path.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.760]   And so it's just always trying to be like that.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.360]   I mean, obviously, as a Christian, I believe that I have a power within me to,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.840]   like, a supernatural power to keep me and hold me down and
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.640]   keep me from making bad decisions, but I'm still a human.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.960]   So part of it is knowing your own struggles, your own vices.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.240]   And then two, count the cost.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.840]   That's what I feel like a lot of people don't do.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.800]   They don't count the cost.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.840]   Like, you could ruin a movement over a moment, you know what I'm saying?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.040]   And that just happens all the time.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.840]   You got a whole movement going on, and then one moment, and it's over.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.600]   And it's like, man, it's not worth it, you know what I mean?
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.560]   >> Nah, that's facts.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.960]   I think, for me, it's like you just said, is it an investment, or
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.840]   is it taken away from what I'm trying to do?
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   But, like you said, every human get in certain moods where it's like,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.280]   if you don't have certain parameters in place, you're gonna do something messed up.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.440]   So for me, it's like, I know over time,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.320]   making the same mistakes, going through the same cycles.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.960]   I know my vices now at this point.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.600]   So it's like, I know what I gotta stay away from.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.640]   Part of the reason I'm on social media is because I know, for me,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.840]   when I'm feeling down about whatever, a game or whatever, I'll run to social media,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.520]   and I'll run to that attention, whether that's women's attention, or
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   just the approval of others, you know what I'm saying, to give me that boost.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.560]   And that wasn't really something I was trying to do.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   So for me, it's just something I had to take out of my life, and I'll go back.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   After a while, I'll get off of it, get back on it.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   And it's cool for a little bit, but then it creeps back in.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.360]   >> Creeps it back up.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.600]   >> And to me, social media has a lot to do with the problems in this world.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.800]   And it's tough, because it can be a positive thing.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.160]   >> For sure. >> But like you said,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.680]   it's an investment for me.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.600]   I know myself, it's just one of my downfalls, you know what I'm saying?
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.280]   >> A lot of people, man.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.800]   This social media is rough, because it's kind of like this
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.880]   false sense of identity for a lot of folks, myself included, you know what I mean?
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.000]   So you gotta fight against that all the time, I definitely know what you mean.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   >> Yeah, for sure, and going off of identity.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.560]   I was telling her before we talked, your song Identity in your Rebel album.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.880]   One of my favorite songs you talk about.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.440]   >> You go back, my ears go back.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.040]   >> No, your Rebel album, that's my favorite album you ever dropped.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.680]   And that song, you just talk about how you try not to find your identity
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.480]   in the things, or your career, your house, your success, whatever it is.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.560]   You try to find your identity in God.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.120]   But that's so much easier said than done, especially when you end in the career,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.320]   or you end these moments.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.480]   It's hard not to find your identity, for me, I know it is.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.680]   When I have a bad game, and I see how just down I get,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.080]   I know I'm not really finding my identity in God.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.160]   A lot of times finding it through basketball, and
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   it's hard because that's all I do all day.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.560]   But how do you think practically you can find your identity in God?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:18.200]   >> Practically, a lot of it comes down to spending time with God.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.900]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.520]   Because the more time you spend with somebody,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.920]   the more their perspective informs you, you know what I mean?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.760]   You feel closer to them, more connected to them.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.360]   So the less time I spend with God, and when I say spending time with God,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.240]   it's just being still, being quiet, prayer, reading my Bible,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.920]   whatever that looks like, the less time I spend with them,
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.600]   the easier it is for me to believe lies.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   The more time you spend with truth, the harder it is to believe lies.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.680]   So it's like when I'm spending more time with God,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   then it's harder to believe the lies.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.160]   It's easier to believe, yeah, this is where my purpose is.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.000]   This is where my worth is.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.920]   This is, and for me, some little things that I do,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.520]   like I take a dry erase marker sometimes, and I'll write verses on my mirror.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.760]   So when I wake up in the morning, I see it, and I'm reminded.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.240]   Just like, all right, I'm God's workmanship creator for things he planned.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.280]   So it's like, all right, this is where my identity lies.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.640]   Because like you said, everybody's on your head.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.880]   Boy, people have been on my head for years about every little thing.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   And it weighs on you.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.680]   People treat you like a product instead of a person.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.160]   And you have to remember, you know what, man?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.720]   I'm not who they say I am.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.200]   I'm who God says I am, and just reminding myself of that.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.600]   Yeah, no, that's big time.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   Because like you just was saying, it's about the input you put in.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.760]   Like, I know me, and I know a lot of people.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.720]   It's really hard to will yourself to be a good person,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.360]   like to will yourself to grow every day.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.800]   But the more you can fill yourself up with good stuff,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.000]   the more you can spend time in the Word, spend time around good people,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.480]   have good conversations, that's the only way it'll overflow out of you.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.360]   And for so long for me, I was just trying to will myself
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.000]   to make the right decisions, and will myself not to do certain things.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   But as a Christian, that make it--
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.640]   your life is kind of like you're always guilty because you're not
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.440]   going to be perfect.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.320]   And when you're trying to will yourself to be better, better, better,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.200]   then you trip.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.920]   Then it's like-- then you just back down in the dumps.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.120]   And that was a big problem for me for a long time.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.080]   And that's kind of how I shaped my faith,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.680]   was like it was a wrong perception of God
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.920]   because it was me trying to just not do stuff.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.600]   And instead of spend time with Him, learn to love Him,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.560]   and then do stuff out of that.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.040]   So you know what I'm saying?
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.080]   So I know you talk a lot about how you lost your religion,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.960]   and you found your faith.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.320]   And I feel like that's something that I'm in the process of doing.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.440]   So what do you really mean when you say you lost your religion
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.920]   and you found your faith?
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.200]   Yeah, religion, like you said, is when you
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.920]   are following rules in order to be accepted by God
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   and accepted by people.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:17.600]   Faith is what it takes-- sorry, I'm popping up on my phone.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.880]   No, faith is when you have to believe that there's
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.720]   nothing you could do to make God love you more or make God love you less.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.560]   The work has already been done.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   And so I think about it like this.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.120]   It's like I went on a cruise one time, my first cruise I ever went on.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   And before I got on a cruise, I was excited.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.800]   I was like, man, we're going to be on this cruise for five days.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.920]   And then I started thinking to myself, oh, I got to pack for this.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.000]   Five days on this boat in the middle of the water.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.200]   And I didn't know any better.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.800]   So I'm like, I'm packing snacks, all kind of stuff.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.120]   Because I don't-- I'm like, you know how the food might be?
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.160]   I don't know what the food situation is going to be like.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.760]   And I'm just bringing all this stuff.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.440]   And he's like, you know, you don't got to bring all this food.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.960]   And I was like, what you mean?
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.440]   He said, all the food is covered on the cost of the cruise.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.960]   It's already been paid for.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.880]   And I think that's how we treat our faith,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.200]   is we try to add all this extra stuff to it
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.880]   instead of realizing all the price has been paid.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.520]   Go enjoy the food.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.400]   Be free to enjoy what's going on.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.520]   Stop trying to earn it.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.840]   Stop trying to build up.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.480]   And because you're an athlete, that's all you know.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.160]   You know if I work hard, I get results.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   But that's-- it's different with God.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.720]   It's more like you get to work hard.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.440]   You get to practice.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.920]   You get to, you know, enjoy Him instead of like, you have to.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.640]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.880]   I feel like, too, like Christians,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.800]   that makes a lot of Christians--
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.720]   like, from the outside looking in,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.360]   I feel like people really think Christians
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.000]   could be the most miserable people because they're not
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.960]   living in freedom.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.800]   It's like they're in chains, but they're trying to do good.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.440]   But they're not necessarily doing good.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.480]   So it makes this perception like Christians
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.720]   is just like always feeling guilty, always down.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.760]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.400]   And honestly, that could be the truth.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.360]   And I think that's why the Bible is say, like, like,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.000]   it's better to be hot or cold, either
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.400]   be all the way in the world doing everything the world do
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.920]   and be guilt free, or like, be all the way for Jesus.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.120]   But I don't think by all the way for Jesus,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   that means that don't do anything wrong.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   It just mean like my dad brought up a quote the other day.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.960]   He just said, like, it was a quote of someone that say,
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.200]   love God, and then do what you want.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.160]   But like, really love God, and that's
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   going to change what you want to do, you know what I'm saying?
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.400]   Big facts.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:37.960]   Big facts.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.040]   Everything else-- when you start with that,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.360]   everything else after that, it makes sense.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.480]   Love God, love your neighbor, and do whatever else you want.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.160]   Because if you're loving God, you're
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.880]   not going to do stupid--
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.800]   stuff that's stupid and harmful to you,
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.920]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.680]   You're going to do things that are helpful.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.880]   Right.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.720]   So how do you think the message in your music
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.680]   has changed as you've come to this reality?
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.520]   Like, early on in your faith, you
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.360]   talk about you was probably more like me in the beginning.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   And now, it's more you've come to this realization.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.400]   You just dropped this Restoration album.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.280]   You talk about that.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.600]   How do you think that that has changed through your music?
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.440]   What was you really talking about early on?
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.000]   And now, what are you more trying to focus on?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.080]   I think early on, man, you know, I was real self-righteous.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.640]   Just real like, look at how I move.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.560]   Look at how I do this.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.360]   I don't do that.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.880]   I don't do this.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.720]   I don't do that.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.480]   I don't do this.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.240]   I don't drink.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.960]   I don't smoke.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.200]   I don't do-- you know, it was all about what I didn't do.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.160]   Look at me, you know what I mean?
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.560]   Look at how I'm trying to follow God.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.240]   And even though I was trying to encourage people to push
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.040]   and to fight, you know, to be what God created them to be,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.120]   I think what I didn't understand is
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.000]   that I was more devoted to my devotion
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.600]   than how devoted God was to me, you know what I mean?
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.480]   So now, I'm not so much like telling people to get like me.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.960]   I'm telling people, look, I understand it's hard.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.800]   I understand that it's tough.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.200]   But you got to keep going, keep taking steps.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.520]   God is going to be with you in that whole process.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.880]   Instead of like trying to will yourself to do it,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.920]   like you were saying, it's leaning on God
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.280]   to be able to get you through.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.680]   Because that's another thing I don't want.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.080]   When you have that culture of like, get like me,
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.520]   when I'm making them type of songs, people love it.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.600]   But then when they mess up, they don't want to come around you.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.640]   Because they feel like, oh, y'all going to look down on me.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.800]   I don't want to--
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.560]   I can't be around them.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.880]   But when you write from the standpoint of like, hey,
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.240]   you know, there's mercy, there's goodness,
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.640]   and there's another way to live.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.120]   And if you fail, it's OK.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.840]   Get back up.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.200]   Because there's another opportunity for you to keep--
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.960]   you know, restoration is available to you.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.080]   And that's what I always want people to understand is like,
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.240]   you know, God is always available
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.240]   for your restoration.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.760]   If you really want to change, he's here, no matter how bad
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.440]   it has been in the past.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.320]   So I think that's how the music has changed.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.680]   Because I've made a lot of mistakes, too.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.560]   When you make some mistakes, then it's like, all right.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.200]   Like, all right.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.920]   That's a fact.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.840]   Yeah, that's a fact.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.160]   How do you-- how do you-- so how do you relate to people?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.200]   When you-- when you in this world of like,
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.440]   living in the rap world, you got a lot of friends
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.040]   who's living probably like, way different than you.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.000]   How do you relate to them to a point
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.080]   so that you can be an influence to them, but also stand out?
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.160]   So like, I know, you know, some pastors
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   or some people that want to reach certain people that
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.240]   are living way different.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.360]   So they kind of got to like, blend in a little bit,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.080]   but still differ from them.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.760]   How do you do that?
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.440]   You know what's funny, man?
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.680]   People make it rocket science sometimes.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.200]   I think what folks don't understand is,
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.040]   people will respect you for being yourself.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.800]   People don't-- people think like, you know,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.440]   everybody got like, a vegan friend.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.920]   And it's like, you know they vegan.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.000]   It doesn't mean you're not going to hang with them no more.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.360]   It's like, you just know when y'all go out.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.000]   It's like, oh yeah, they ain't going to eat no burger.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.640]   They might got Impossible Burgers though, bro,
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.400]   if you want to get an Impossible Burger or something
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.200]   like that.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.920]   It's just-- but they're not--
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.000]   they're not hiding the fact that they vegan.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.520]   They just-- this is what they about.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.640]   And this is how they move and they function.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.040]   And I think that's where my freedom was found,
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.320]   is I'm going to be myself, you know?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.840]   I don't-- I'll be around you.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.560]   Oh man, my bad, I'm smoking.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.360]   Smoke?
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.360]   I'm not going to.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.200]   And I'm not going to judge you.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.240]   I'm not going to condemn you for what you doing.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.680]   Because at the end of the day, I'm
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.080]   not here to point out all the little things
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.880]   that you doing wrong.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.360]   I'm here to be a picture of how good and loving God is,
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.600]   And how my relationship with him has made
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.240]   some things better in my life, you know?
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.200]   A different look at peace and joy.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.640]   So that's really-- I'm just there to be
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.040]   a light in those dark places.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.240]   So when I'm around folks, man, I just try to be real.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.840]   I don't try to be holier than thou.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.320]   I don't try to do any of that stuff.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.640]   I was in a studio with lots of rappers
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.600]   that people would be like, what you doing hanging
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.440]   out with these folks?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   But that's why they love me, is because I
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.000]   don't mind being around them.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.760]   You think early on, early on, like with that,
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.480]   you had to be careful about how much time
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.160]   you spent early on in your walk with God.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.720]   Because you got to really be like Jesus hung with the sinners.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.560]   But it's because his faith was so strong.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.200]   But early on, like in someone's faith walk,
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.360]   they might got to be careful being around those dark places
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.760]   because it might bring them down.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.560]   You think you evolved to that spot
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.240]   where nothing can shake you no more?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.800]   Or you think it was always like--
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.600]   I had to-- you know, you grow there.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.000]   You grow into that space.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.200]   Like early on, I made a lot of mistakes
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.400]   because I thought, like you said, I was invincible.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.840]   Like, I can do this.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   The thing is, it's like somebody saying, man,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.920]   they see you on the court.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.360]   And they're like, I could do that.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.640]   You know, they're watching you.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.520]   They don't know how many hours of practice you put in.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.160]   They don't know how many shots you get up
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.040]   when nobody's looking.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.720]   They don't know how many plays you memorize.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.960]   And they don't know all of that.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.720]   So a lot of times, people are like, oh, yeah,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.000]   I could go to the BET Awards.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.560]   I'd be straight.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.760]   Or I could go hang with these people.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.160]   And it's like, you don't know how much, you know,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.600]   meditation and prayer I done put in, how much studying
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.400]   of my word I done put in, how much barriers and boundaries
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.040]   I put around myself in order to be able to walk
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.840]   in these spaces and places.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.400]   Because if you don't, you know, then, yeah,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.160]   of course you're going to fall.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.800]   So, man, this is called Curious Mike.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.160]   We talk about anything on here.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.880]   Like, that's why I called it Curious Mike.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.240]   Because I'm going to just talk about stuff
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   that I'm curious about and just stuff
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.560]   that I feel like a lot of people want to ask,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   but they might be hesitant to ask.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.440]   So, like, with the drinking and the smoking,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.400]   like, I remember I hit you up a while ago.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.760]   And I was just wondering, like, is this a sin?
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.120]   Because God put it on the Earth.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.640]   So, like, as long as I'm not addicted to it
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.040]   and I'm moderate in it, what--
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.240]   and then I'm going to ask you, like, what do you think of it?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.400]   Or, like, even drinking.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.120]   I know people that, like, use drinking, like, way too far.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.760]   And they take it way too far.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   But, like, you know, for me, it's not that.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.440]   But, like, all in all, what do you think about the drinking
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.880]   and the smoking?
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.360]   You know, I got to--
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.880]   I mean, here's the thing.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.440]   It first comes down to, are you--
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.720]   are you a Christian, right?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.360]   Because if you're not, then there's different--
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.800]   then you following a whole different set of beliefs
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.200]   and views and values.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.320]   So if you say, yeah, I'm a follower of Jesus, OK, cool.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.080]   So then I can use the Bible as our kind of North Star,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.600]   in a sense, to talk about stuff.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.400]   Right.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.200]   Cool.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.000]   All right, bet.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.200]   So let's look at that, then, and see what that says for us.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.080]   And what I-- what I understand is, you know,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.680]   obviously, the Lord tells us to be sober-minded.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.600]   And the idea of being sober-minded is just, man,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.280]   are you-- are you always ready to--
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.760]   to withstand the darts the enemy's going to throw at you?
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.360]   Because if you drunk, you not ready.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.560]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.600]   You not ready.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.560]   Them darts is coming, and you out of there, champ.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.440]   So it's, are you sober-minded?
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.520]   And, you know, all throughout the Bible, it uses, you know,
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.720]   Jesus turned water into wine.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.160]   It doesn't condemn alcohol.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.200]   It condemns drunkenness.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.000]   Right.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.200]   So it comes down to you being able to follow
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.480]   your convictions, because you got
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.240]   your own internal convictions about.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.720]   And if you are doing something you feel is wrong,
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.440]   then you sinning against your own conscience in that moment,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.760]   because you know you feel convicted about it.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.280]   So you wrong, you know.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.960]   And Romans 14 talks about, you know,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.800]   some people are weaker in this area.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.960]   Some people are not in this area.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.240]   So when it comes to smoking, I feel
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.760]   like anything that enhances your ability to be a light
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.880]   and to represent the kingdom is--
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.160]   I don't have a problem with it, right?
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.480]   If it's enhancing your ability to be a light,
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.880]   and it's not a detriment, you know what I mean?
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.560]   It's not tearing you down, hurting you,
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.520]   hurting other people.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.280]   It's not illegal.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.040]   Cool.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.520]   But at the same time, you got to have your own barrier.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.240]   You got to know where that line is drawn for you.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.000]   I, personally, I'm not a smoker, you know what I'm saying?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.600]   But I have friends who are.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.880]   I have friends who are Christians, and they smoke.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.480]   That's not a line I dabble with, because I don't know--
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.600]   like, alcohol, I know.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.400]   One shot, all right, two shots, and then it's a wrap.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.640]   Like, now I may be going past my limit.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.600]   Smoking, it's like, I don't know how much
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   took me past the limit, you know what I'm saying?
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.200]   So-- but that's me.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.240]   That's where I'm at with it.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.360]   But at the end of the day, I think you just
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.880]   got to abide by your conscience.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.920]   And then, I don't try to look for how far I can
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.840]   go before I'm too far.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.920]   I try to look for how close to God I can be.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.600]   And that's what I always try to strive for.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.640]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.960]   That's the ideal way, see how close you could be.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.440]   But I like what you said about the conscience,
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.400]   because I've had this conversation
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.120]   with a lot of people.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.840]   And I think, like, there's a lot of things
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.440]   in the Bible that is black and white.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.520]   Like, you can do this, you shouldn't do this.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.760]   And there's, like-- there is some gray areas.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.400]   And, like, as Christians, like, you might have
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.960]   a conviction that someone else don't have.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.400]   And I don't really-- I don't like when, like,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.800]   Christians try to judge other people because--
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.240]   just because their convictions are different
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.120]   than another Christian's.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.760]   Because, like, people struggle with different things.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.440]   We talked about this before we start the interview.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.840]   But just, like, knowing yourself and knowing
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.080]   your own vices, what you would run to when you're--
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.880]   when you're feeling, like, down or something.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.640]   Like, if that's something you would run to,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.080]   then probably stay away from it.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.160]   Because-- but, like, if it's just something
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.440]   that you're using in moderation,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.040]   like, I feel like it's--
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.320]   Moderation is key, baby.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:58.720]   Food, alcohol, sugar, moderation, baby.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.520]   Shrooms.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.240]   I don't know.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.120]   LSD.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.480]   That's eight hours, you gone.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.680]   You're out of there for eight hours.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:04.880]   Can you rep it?
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.800]   Can you be a kingdom by comparison?
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.240]   I just want to try it one time.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.280]   I'm cool.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   I'm actually really good on that.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.000]   I don't want nothing controlling me for eight hours.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.960]   I'm good.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.920]   Get me off the bus.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.280]   Let me off the bus.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.960]   I feel you on that.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.920]   Man, last thing I really want to talk about was the--
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.880]   just your-- your, like, how--
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.120]   how big you are into, like, the social justice.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.720]   And, like, you-- that seems like that's something
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.280]   you're really into right now and pushing for right now.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.520]   How-- what do you see in our world is the biggest way
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.440]   that you can help and the biggest issues
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.760]   in our world right now in that area?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   Well, one is-- is, man, we don't listen to each other.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.360]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.400]   We don't listen to each other.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.240]   We don't hear each other's stories.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.320]   We don't try to see where other people are coming from.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.440]   We don't try to learn.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.520]   We-- no, we-- we just want to talk over everybody.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.000]   That's why I don't like Clubhouse, you know, the app.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.800]   I heard about that.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.360]   What is that app?
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.960]   It's basically, like, we're-- it's social media,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.240]   but everybody's talking.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.360]   So instead of, like, typing or posting pictures,
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.320]   you just talk.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.200]   And it was dope at first.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.800]   But then everybody just started talking over each other.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.840]   Nobody's listening to each other.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   Everybody an expert in their own little spaces.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.040]   And so if you are a learner, you know,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.320]   you can learn from people.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.920]   And learn from their perspectives.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.680]   But if you think you've got it all figured out,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.120]   of course we're going to end up like this.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.880]   Because now you-- what you're saying is,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.560]   I have nothing to learn from you.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.640]   So even people I really disagree with,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.920]   I just like to know why they believe what they believe.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.880]   You're just trying to learn.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.840]   So I could say, OK, I see where you're coming from.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.760]   Have you considered this?
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.440]   And I think that creates a lot of problems.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.320]   And so, you know, when we don't listen to each other,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.800]   we're not learning from each other.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.720]   And we're not learning what different issues are
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.440]   and different problems.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.200]   And when you on the top, you know what I mean?
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.360]   Like, you don't need people.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   And when I say need, like, I'm making money.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.240]   I live in a nice neighborhood, whatever.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.680]   I don't need the people in the hood or in the projects.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.480]   I don't need y'all.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.760]   So I'm not listening to y'all.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.280]   Y'all don't have nothing to offer me.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.240]   Y'all need to listen to me.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.920]   I'm the one with the money and the nice house.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.200]   And that's where the problem comes.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.960]   Because they're trying to tell me what's going on in their world.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.840]   And I'm saying, I know better than y'all.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.040]   Y'all don't know what's going on.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.440]   And I think that just creates a lot of tension.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.240]   I'm saying with race and ethnicities, too.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.280]   Nobody's listening.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.640]   We're trying to tell y'all this.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.200]   It's like you can't have an opinion no more.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:33.840]   Nope.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.120]   Or they'll cancel you.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.920]   You canceled yourself.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.120]   You took yourself off social media.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.000]   Go right on, bro.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:45.680]   Man, speaking of that, I remember that situation with George Floyd.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.600]   And how that went down and how heartbreaking that was.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   And I remember seeing that video and being in tears, being devastated.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.040]   And I remember tweeting-- there was three tweets.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.720]   The first one was just like, man, that's murder.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.160]   I just witnessed murder.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.440]   The second one was like, that's heartbreaking.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.280]   It brings tears to my eyes watching that video.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.400]   Something else.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.040]   And then the third one was like-- because when you see stuff like that, you go to the
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.080]   barbershop or wherever, where there's a lot of black people, and then they're all talking
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.640]   about that.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.360]   It can cause black people, when you see stuff like that, to have a hatred towards white
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.320]   people, in a way.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.000]   And when I see stuff like that, that's kind of what starts to creep into your head, no
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.240]   matter how hard you try not for it to.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.360]   And so then I remember thinking, man, but what would God say?
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.840]   And I remember the third tweet I tweeted was, as much as you pray for George's family and
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.360]   how heartbreaking it is, also pray that God would change the hearts of these police officers
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.760]   that would even have the intent to do that.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.320]   And that tweet, the first, for a little while, it was just my followers that seen it.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.560]   And it was like, man, that's big time, bro.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.680]   Good perspective.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   Then some people saw it and was like, hold on.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.880]   He's talking about pray for the officers that just murdered this dude?
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   Man, when I went there, then some famous people started having backlash on it.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.960]   And then after that, everybody talking crazy.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.680]   And everybody saw it, and people was really hurt by it and not understanding what I said,
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.600]   and not understanding the tweets that I had tweeted prior to that.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:26.160]   And that was hurtful for me, just because of how much that stuff affects me and what
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.520]   I see when I see that video.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.120]   But I just remember you hit me.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.920]   Do you kind of remember what your thoughts was in that situation, what you were thinking?
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.040]   Some of it.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   I remember saying-- there's a few things that come to mind.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.480]   One is just like, man, you know, it was the timing.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:44.960]   Right.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.160]   It was just the timing, and everyone's grieving George Floyd's death.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:58.320]   And sometimes truth isn't received when it's received in a time where people aren't prepared
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.120]   to receive that.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.840]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:08.640]   And so it's kind of like, you know, if your mom or dad or cousin got locked up, and you're
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.360]   sad about it, but they really committed the crime, and someone's like, yeah, well that's--
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.320]   You're not trying to hear nothing.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   It's like, you know, oh, they're locked up.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:18.640]   You know?
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.560]   So that's-- it was more of the timing.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.800]   And then, you know, obviously, social media is the place where people are going to misunderstand
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.040]   you.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:33.760]   And especially you coming from a Christian perspective where love is our North Star,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.120]   it's really difficult.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.560]   Because when you try to promote love, some people hear acceptance.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.280]   Right.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.760]   It's like-- so you're saying, hey, man, love your enemy.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.440]   So I need to accept what they did to me?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   No, we're not saying accept it.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.400]   We're saying love.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.280]   Love doesn't tolerate injustice or accept it.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:28:02.320]   Love still hates what's done, but it still tries to flesh out what it looks like to be
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:02.960]   consistent.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.200]   So--
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.520]   No, I definitely-- the timing thing, I definitely was feeling that.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.000]   If I could take it back, it probably would have been based on the timing.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.320]   But at the time, it was to my followers.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.480]   I didn't know the whole world was going to see that, Joanne.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:18.800]   Like--
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.360]   Oh, they did.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.280]   Oh, they did.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.000]   That's why I called you.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.640]   Because I was like, man, everybody's just going to say something.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.800]   And no one's going-- like, I hate that.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.520]   Just talk to me.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.800]   Talk to me.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.720]   Don't come at me on social media.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.240]   So yeah, now, like sometimes the-- like in Jesus's way, this happened back then.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.000]   And I feel like it's even more prevalent now.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.120]   Like what Jesus would preach was so counter-cultural to what people thought was right.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.600]   It was like he was killed for it.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.280]   Like he was killed for the message he was speaking.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.040]   Even though it was like about love, people don't know how to receive that.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.520]   And I feel like that's another thing wrong with the world today.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.760]   It's like people don't even understand-- like it's almost like God said like in the end days,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.280]   good is going to become evil, and evil is going to become good.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   And I feel like we're getting close to that almost.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.520]   Like so do you see that in this culture today?
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.560]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.160]   Without a shadow of a doubt.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:24.800]   You know, it's just a society now where we-- I think we tolerate-- we tolerate everything.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.760]   And when you tolerate everything, some things are not good.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.720]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.680]   They're wrong.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:38.800]   And when it's wrong-- when it becomes wrong to put your foot down and say, I don't agree with this,
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.280]   then like you're saying, evil becomes good, and good becomes evil.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.720]   So tolerating nonsense or foolishness becomes good.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:54.320]   And then putting your foot down and saying, hey, we don't do this becomes bad.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.440]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:04.800]   And so that's a unique place, man, where I think for me, there's a lot of things that--
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.760]   obviously, we all got a lot of learning to do and unlearning to do.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.520]   So I'm always trying to learn and unlearn.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:14.640]   But I can follow a person-- like when people disagree with me,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.040]   I can follow a person who stands by what they believe in.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.720]   At least I know what you stand on.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.160]   And so I'm like, all right, cool.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.760]   Now, can we have a discussion about it?
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.160]   Because somebody may be looking at things from the wrong perspective.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.440]   And when we can do that, then I'm like, good.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.360]   But we're not able to do that no more, which makes me feel like, all right, well, here we go.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.040]   We get into that time period, wars, rumors of wars.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:49.600]   I mean, Christ said-- he said when he was alive that they were in the last days
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.720]   and the last days are coming.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.240]   So I think it's just a long time period of us being in the last days.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.520]   I don't know when he's coming back.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.720]   But I do know it's been consistent.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.640]   It's been consistent.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.000]   But it ain't no way we're going to be here for more than, what, 100 years.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.200]   I think it's going to happen in our generation, to be honest.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.920]   Well, we got some work to do then, you know what I'm saying?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.760]   We got some promotion to do.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.960]   We need to start promoting this kingdom.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:24.240]   How much of that good looked at as bad and bad looked at as good do you think
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   comes from the music industry and the rap culture, like multiple women now?
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.920]   If you were a dude who only talked to one girl, and you only got one girl,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.480]   and you ain't cheating on her now, you kind of looked at a square these days.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.640]   Or if you ain't doing this, now you looked at it as soft.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.080]   If you ain't promoting violence or whatever, how much of that do you think?
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.160]   Because you in the music culture, how much do you think stems from that?
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.760]   Art imitates life that imitates art.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.600]   So I think there are some parts of it that are real.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.280]   But then when people learn, oh, if I rap about this, I make money.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.520]   So I'm going to rap about it a lot.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:09.520]   And then the world says, oh, well, I need to imitate what I just saw more.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.560]   And so I think some of it is real.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.520]   And then music talks about what's real.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.080]   But then when music does it, it glorifies it.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.440]   And then people really start--
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.040]   Messing with it.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.520]   Exactly.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.080]   So I think that's really what happens.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.160]   And I see it all the time, where--
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:32.240]   I mean, even like myself, people just see something, and they want that.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.320]   Like, for me, being a Christian, and then breaking all these barriers.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.560]   Oh, you doing BET, and you winning the Grammy.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.200]   Like, first rapper to do all this stuff.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.600]   A lot of young Christians who rap saw that.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.120]   And that's what they went after.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.920]   Just the awards, and the limelight, and the fame and stuff.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.040]   And not the heart that went behind it.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.080]   So yeah, you saw it all happen.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.000]   And you was like, oh, I need to be a part of it.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.200]   I need to do this.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.800]   And I think that's what happens a lot of times, too.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.000]   It's like, some kid who never thought about being a gang member, who never thought about
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.960]   none of that stuff, is listening to some Chicago Drills dudes.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.760]   And they like, yeah, that's what I'm on.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.260]   And it's like--
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.160]   And plus, it's way harder to make it the way you made it than it is to rap about what everybody
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.200]   else is rapping about, I feel like.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.000]   Way harder, bro.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.680]   I'll be jealous.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.560]   I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.040]   I'm jealous.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.880]   I've been telling people, like, you're so lyrically genius.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.560]   If you was a secular artist, you would be all the way up there.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.640]   Bro, it's so easy to get in the studio and freestyle--
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.360]   About anything.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.160]   About anything.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.520]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.720]   I could go for hours.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   I could make 50 million songs.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.840]   But to have to like, all right, I'm going to say this.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.960]   And I'm going to think through this.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.640]   It's work, man.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.240]   Is there any pressure that come with, like, when people think of, like, you know, Christian
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.880]   rap, which you don't really like being put into that category.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.200]   But is there pressure being like, the dude?
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.400]   Like, when they think of that, they think of Lecrae.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.160]   Like, is it pressure to come with that?
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.440]   It's pressure at first.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.360]   And then you own it.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   At first, it's pressure.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.240]   Then you own it.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.200]   And it becomes, this is what I do.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.840]   So it just becomes, this is what I do.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.360]   So let me make sure y'all get a good representation of this.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:19.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.560]   Because it's what I do.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.200]   Same with you.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.480]   It's like being on a court.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.280]   It's like, you know, is it pressure being at the highest level of basketball?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.400]   And it's like, sure.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.040]   But then it's like, man, I've been doing it, you know, so long.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.280]   I've been playing so many games.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.520]   This is what I do now.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.640]   Yeah, you ain't nervous no more.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.600]   You said that in your music.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.880]   You said, I've been doing it so long.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.400]   I don't get nervous.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.720]   Yeah, that's facts.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.640]   Now, I got one last question for you.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.160]   So why you choose Jesus?
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.080]   Was there ever a period in time where you wanted to explore your faith?
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.000]   I went through this probably a year and a half, two years ago,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.280]   where I didn't know what I believed.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.800]   I didn't know what I wanted to believe.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.480]   Why you chose Jesus instead of anyone else?
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.680]   I'm definitely like a thinker.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:13.200]   And I remember studying world religions, you know, before I was like,
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.280]   I'm landing my plane on the Christian faith.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.240]   And I've had rocky roads and doubts and all that type of stuff in the journey.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.760]   But really what solidified it for me was, as I looked at the world's religions,
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.080]   and I mean, you can go through them all, right?
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:26.800]   Which I did.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.120]   I went through all the ones that I knew about anyway.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   When you talk to people, and I have good friends who believe,
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.160]   who are Buddhists, who are Muslim, who are agnostic.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.600]   I got some Rastafarian friends.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:49.280]   When you talk to them all, and you say, man, how do I get to God?
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.040]   How do I get to him?
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.880]   All of them will tell you, there's something you got to do.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.880]   There's something you got to do.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.040]   You got to do this, and then do this, and then do this.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.760]   Or you got to do this.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.880]   Exactly.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.840]   You got to perform.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.880]   And I said, man, that's just hard.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.400]   Who knows?
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:10.880]   No one knows.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.080]   Everyone's dying like this.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.320]   I hope I get there.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:20.960]   And Jesus is the only one that said, all you got to do is trust me.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.200]   I performed already.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.920]   So every other faith, you got to reach up to try to get to God.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.480]   But Christ reaches down and pulls you up to God.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.760]   And I was like, I'm done.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.040]   Because I know I'll never be perfect.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.560]   Man, you know how messed up you are, right?
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.000]   That's what it was for me too.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.680]   I know how jacked up I am.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.600]   So if every other religion, you got to perform and do enough to make it.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.640]   Christianity is the only one where it's like, nah, someone came and saved you.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.040]   That's the one I'm rocking with.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.080]   I'm rocking with it.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.360]   And Christianity has almost become now, like we talked about this earlier.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.280]   But it's almost become, in this day and age, a little performance based.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.280]   But real Christianity, I mean, it's just about faith and believing.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.000]   Not that weird old stuff you see on TV, OK?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.120]   Not that weird old stuff.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.360]   We're talking authentic.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.520]   I don't even-- sometimes I just be saying, I'm a believer.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.320]   I don't even want to say I'm a Christian, because I know people are like, oh, you're like--
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.840]   Yeah, I'm a believer.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.560]   I'm a believer.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.480]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.800]   This day and age, some people just talk about God too.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.480]   They don't even mention what God.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.760]   They say they believe in God.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.640]   That's true.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.560]   Or I feel like a big movement these days too is, you know, the new age type of religion,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.760]   where you're kind of like almost your own God, like you're trying to become your own.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.360]   Giving the universe all the credit.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.560]   Yeah, it's like-- and that's-- I ain't gonna lie.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   That's what I-- I had dabbled in a little bit.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.880]   I was going to the crystal store to get my little crystals.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.360]   I heard they was going like, whatever.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:54.400]   Like, that's-- and that too, it's like, why make yourself your own God?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.760]   Like, that's trying to will yourself to be better.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.960]   Amen.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.720]   I'm with-- I think God puts all those things here for us to enjoy.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.880]   And they're useful in their own ways.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.560]   I agree.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.360]   As far as, you know, like meditation or yoga, all those things can be beneficial.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.000]   But when it becomes-- when it becomes God, then we in trouble.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.520]   I think even like, yeah, like you said, even astrology or something.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.560]   There might really be some truth to them zodiac signs or like a story told in the stars or
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:26.880]   whatever.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.120]   But then when that becomes like your basis for like living in faith, that's when it becomes
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.600]   dangerous.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.160]   Right.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.600]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.560]   Yes, indeed.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.000]   Man, well, I appreciate you.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.880]   It's been dope.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.440]   We talked about a lot of stuff and I appreciate you, my guy.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.240]   My guy.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:40.740]   Respect.
