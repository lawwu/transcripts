[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, each of us have our own unique struggles in life, and each of us know what it's like
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.320]   to meet times in life when we find ourselves out of gas.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.560]   So how do we keep pressing on when we feel completely depleted?
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.840]   This reality is certainly true inside Angola, the largest maximum security prison in the
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.280]   US and home to 6,300 prisoners, a place reserved for only murderers, rapists, armed robbers,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.600]   and habitual felons, where the average sentence in Angola is 88 years with 3,200 people in
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   one place serving life sentences.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.960]   90% of the inmates will die here.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.520]   Warden Burl Kane led this place for years.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.760]   He was an outspoken Christian and a man with a near-mythical reputation for turning Angola,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   once known as the bloodiest prison in the South, into a model facility.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.880]   Pastor John preached in Angola's chapel on November 20, 2009 to about 800 prisoners.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.680]   He preached on John 6 on Jesus' feeding of the 5,000 and His walk on water.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.240]   Here's one of my favorite clips from what is one of my favorite sermons all time on
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.320]   the goodness of Jesus when it feels like we have run out of gas for life.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.480]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.800]   So far, He's done this miracle, the miracle of multiplying the loaves, the point of the
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.680]   loaves being let your eyes run up the beam of glory to see the one who with a simple
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.320]   word and a prayer can feed 5,000 people with a little basket full of food.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.640]   See Him, love Him, know Him, make Him your treasure.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.680]   That's what I hope is happening in your heart now.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.520]   So let's go to verses 16 to 21.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.820]   When the evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, got into a boat, and started
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.180]   across the sea to Capernaum.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.240]   So they're leaving Jesus behind.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   Now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Verse 18, "The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.440]   When they had rode three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea."
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.800]   Let me stop there a minute, make a comment that Warden Cain mentioned to me earlier.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   He said, "You had a preacher here a couple of months ago that said what happened in the
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.720]   feeding of the 5,000 was that when Jesus took the little boy's lunch and gave it out, everybody
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   was inspired to share their lunch, and that's how everybody got fed."
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.160]   Boy, is that ever classic liberal unbelief.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.680]   The reason we know that's not what it means is not only because of the words I paused
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.480]   over that He distributed the loaves.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.400]   They all ate from the loaves that He distributed, but what's He going to do with the walking
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   on water?
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   Who cooperated and gave their lunch to make that happen?
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.840]   Like the molecules cooperated.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.880]   Let's turn into ice.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.720]   Don't like that kind of unbelief, and I'm sorry it was preached in this pulpit.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.480]   You guys are smart enough to see through it, I am sure.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.000]   Okay, we stopped where we shouldn't have stopped.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.760]   Verse 19, "When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.840]   sea, and coming near the boat, they were frightened.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.400]   But He said to them, 'It is I.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.280]   Do not be afraid.'
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.900]   Then they were glad to take Him in the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.080]   which they were going."
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.800]   Now there are several amazing, remarkable, surprising, almost inexplicable things about
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.560]   this, and I don't mean the walking on the water merely.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.360]   I'll affirm it, I believe Jesus walks on water.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.040]   He made water.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.160]   He speaks water into being every moment of the day.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.120]   He upholds the universe by the word of His power.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.800]   This is no problem for Jesus to walk on water.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.760]   So that's there and that's true.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.960]   That's our God, Jesus Christ.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.040]   But here's a couple of puzzling things.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:29.640]   I said that the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 is unpacked in 71 verses in chapter
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.940]   6.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.800]   This miracle has no unpacking.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.600]   It's never mentioned again in this gospel or in this chapter.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.960]   It happens.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.520]   The crowds never hear about it.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.600]   Only the disciples see it, and it's over, and it's never mentioned again.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.200]   What's the function of it?
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.320]   What's the purpose of this miracle here in this bread story?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   That's my question.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.000]   Here's the second thing.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.220]   When they see Him, wind is blowing, the boat's about to be sunk, they're three miles out
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.700]   from land, nobody's swimming to shore probably in this kind of water.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.700]   It's dangerous.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   They're going to live their lives.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.220]   Jesus comes walking on that tortured sea, and they see Him, and He says, "It's I," and
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.740]   they gladly, gladly welcome Him, Him, Him into the boat.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.580]   And you know the next thing it says?
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.300]   They're at the shore.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.180]   That story's over.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.980]   There is not a word said about the storm stopping like in the other gospels.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.380]   There's not a word said about the waves going flat and a great calm and the wind ceasing.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.080]   Not a word about this storm being conquered by Jesus.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.400]   That's not the point.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.760]   The point is, He got in the boat.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.300]   He got in the boat in the storm.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.180]   No comment about the storm.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.700]   And as soon as He's in the boat, the story's over.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.240]   So here's what I think the point of this miracle is.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.980]   I left out an important part of the bread story.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.620]   Let me go back and pick it up and then relate it to this.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.620]   What did I leave out?
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.140]   I left out the 12 baskets.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.140]   Okay?
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.540]   Let's go back and get the 12 baskets.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.940]   How many, tell me this now, how many apostles were collecting leftover pieces?
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.240]   12.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.100]   How many baskets did they take up?
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.460]   Do you think there's a reason for that?
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.420]   I do.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.300]   What would be the point of Jesus seeing to it?
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.300]   This is amazing.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:49.520]   Jesus seeing to it that 5,000 people are fed from 5 loaves and exactly 12 baskets are left
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.420]   over for 12 apostles.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.380]   What's the point of that?
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.820]   And here's what I think the point is.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.100]   Picture yourself now as one of the distributors of the bread.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.900]   You see this little boy's got 5 loaves and 2 fish.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.140]   Jesus prays, gives you a basket and you say, "Whoa, where did that come from?"
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.780]   And you start giving out and you feel like, "I can't feed 5,000 people.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.900]   He's assigned me to feed 5,000 people.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.820]   I'm going to run out of food."
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.140]   Or you might say, "I can't do this prison thing.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.600]   I'm going to run out of gas here.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.220]   I'm going to run out of emotional gas.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.660]   I can't do this.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.820]   This boat is going to sink and me in it."
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:43.940]   I think the reason for following the basket lesson with the boat lesson is to underline
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.460]   the basket lesson.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.940]   The basket lesson is you join Jesus in His ministry here, there will always be just enough
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.020]   for you.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.500]   Just enough for you.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.140]   You're not going to get rich here.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.860]   I ask about that.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.060]   Of course, you may try and prove that you're an idolater.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.100]   You're going to get rich.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.740]   Finally, you're going to get rich.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.420]   Forget that.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.500]   We don't get rich here.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.020]   We don't get rich on the planet.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.220]   We get one basket, just enough.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.060]   One for me, a personal attention to you from Jesus Christ.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.980]   You join Him in His cause.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.780]   He looks on you as an individual.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.700]   I got a basket for you.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.340]   I know what your need is.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.460]   Tonight in the cell, I know what your need is in the dormitory.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.940]   I know what your need is tonight.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.180]   There'll be a basket for you tonight and tomorrow and the next day and the next day.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:50.260]   My God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.860]   But not everything you may think is a need.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.620]   He knows what you need.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.260]   You know what you need.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.620]   He knows what you need, and it'll be there.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.900]   God never runs my life the way I think He ought to, ever.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:11.340]   I try to do stuff, and He's always got a different plan for my day, a different plan for my marriage,
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.580]   a different plan for my kids.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.140]   And if I didn't trust Him as a good shepherd and a good father and a good guide and a good
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.100]   provider, I'd get very, very discouraged.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.700]   So the point of the baskets is He individually provides for His own when they join Him in
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.180]   His cause and trust Him, and then you get on the boat.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.380]   Three miles out, where's Jesus?
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.740]   He's three miles away up in the mountains, and they're about to drown in the middle of
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.900]   the Sea of Galilee.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.140]   They think, "Well, I guess the basket lesson doesn't come true.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.840]   Doesn't work on the water."
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:59.300]   And just when they think, "We're history," He comes walking on the water.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.580]   Now what's the point of that?
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.100]   I will walk on water to do what I said I would do.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.380]   I will walk on Angola water to get to you.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.100]   I will go through bars to get to you.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.260]   I will climb fences and cut my hands to get to you.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.320]   Till I bleed to death, I will get to you.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:30.940]   So I think the function of these stories for the followers of Jesus is you get a basket
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:37.780]   when you need it, just one for you, tailor-made, and in the moment when you think, "There can't
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.960]   be any basket for me here because the waves are slopping over the side of my boat and
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.420]   Jesus is three miles away," He comes walking on the water.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.340]   And He gets in the boat and the story's over.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.780]   This is not a story about getting people out of storms.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.060]   This is a story about getting Jesus in the boat.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.100]   This is the boat.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.660]   I got my boat.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.460]   I got my issues.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.460]   They're not yours.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.820]   And I got to trust Him for my family issues and my church issues and my health issues.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.460]   You got your issues.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.500]   You got your boat.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.180]   You got your storms.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.940]   You got your hungers.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.300]   You can trust Him.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.300]   Amen.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.620]   Till I bleed to death, I will get to you.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.100]   That is a powerful line.
