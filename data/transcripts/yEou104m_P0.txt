[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   there's two people in the back,
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.280]   two of her homegirls wearing like shiesty masks.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   And I'm like, what are we doing?
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   Where are we going?
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.680]   And she goes, we're gonna go film the riot.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.280]   We're going to Lake Street.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.200]   And so we drive down there.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.720]   Kmart is burning.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.560]   Target is burning.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.880]   Everything is on fire.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.720]   She has the Sony A7.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.440]   She gives me a microphone and she's like,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.880]   go talk to that guy.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.000]   And that was a guy with a Molotov cocktail in his hand
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.480]   who had just burned Kmart down.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.840]   And so I go, what should I ask him?
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.360]   She goes, what's on your mind?
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760]   So I walk up to him and I'm like, what's on your mind?
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.440]   The following is a conversation with Andrew Callaghan,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.840]   host of Channel 5 on YouTube,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.080]   where he does Gazelle style interviews
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080]   with fascinating humans at the edges of society.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.680]   The so-called vagrants, vagabonds, runaways, outlaws,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.520]   from QAnon adherents to fish heads,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000]   to O'Block residents, and much more.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480]   He created the documentary that I highly recommend
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.880]   called "This Place Rules" on the undercurrents
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.040]   that led to the January 6th Capitol riots.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.960]   This is the "Live Streaming" podcast.

[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.240]   in the description.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Callaghan.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.760]   - I tried to color match you though.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.240]   Got the black and white going.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.200]   I went to Walmart before this and got the Wrangler shirt
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.360]   with the Texas Longhorns tee.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.840]   - Is that where you shop, Walmart?
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   - Generally, yeah.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240]   - I'm a Target man myself.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.760]   - There's no way you get those suits from Target.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.000]   - So you're saying it's a nice way to compliment a suit.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640]   - I think you go men's warehouse, if not further.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.480]   - I think you would be wrong.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.440]   - You go further.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.720]   - No, the other direction.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.760]   - You got that from Target?
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.600]   - Not Target.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   I was joking about Target.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   I like Walmart better.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960]   It just felt like a funny thing to say.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.240]   - No, it was funny.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.120]   - The most expensive thing I own is this watch,
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.760]   and it was given to me as a gift.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.600]   - Yeah.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.400]   When I was on tour, I had these $2,700 Cartier glasses
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.720]   that I got for a lot of money.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.560]   $2,700.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   - Like sunglasses?
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.520]   - Yeah, but they were really embarrassing.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   But I was on tour, so I just felt like I could do anything
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.120]   as far as fashion choices.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.520]   But looking back at pictures from myself in that era,
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.480]   I'm like, God.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.640]   - So that was the symbol of the fame got to your head.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.480]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.840]   I think fame getting to your head.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.280]   If you spend more than 100 bucks on sunglasses,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.440]   you've officially gone off the deep end.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.360]   - You've crossed the line.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   - Totally.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   - And that's where you go back to Walmart to humble yourself.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.520]   I really love Walmart.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   In fact, I moved to Austin because I was at Walmart
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.160]   and a lady said that I look handsome in a suit.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.320]   And I was like, that's it.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.240]   I love this place.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.000]   She just said it for no reason whatsoever.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.920]   This older lady just kind of looked at me
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.800]   and with this genuine sweetness,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.680]   just said, "Oh, you look handsome."
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440]   - She's not wrong, man.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.280]   - Thank you.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.760]   - That's part of your whole swag though.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.720]   - Yeah, the suit thing.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.560]   Yep.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.640]   Anyway, what was the first, if you remember,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   first recorded interview you did?
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.760]   - Well, like my first grade teacher, Mrs. Claudia,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.600]   this is back in the day, like I was telling you,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360]   we just asked her about her life in Columbia
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.400]   and stuff like that.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.000]   But I didn't really get into actual journalism
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.880]   until my ninth grade year.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.160]   I had no idea I had an interest in it.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280]   Before then, I wanted to be a rapper.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   It's all about hip hop and meditation
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   and picking psilocybin mushrooms in public parks
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.120]   and stuff like that.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.960]   That's what I was into.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.800]   - That's a lot.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.880]   Psilocybin, meditation, rap, public parks.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.080]   - Yeah, I was making like conscious rap music.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.240]   I was to the point where I had like four dream catchers
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.920]   hanging above my bed, Alex Gray painting on the wall,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.000]   tapestry on the ceiling,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360]   just scribbling rhymes down all the time.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.520]   - So you said somewhere that you sucked at school.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.400]   - Okay, well, let's step back a little bit.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.360]   So I had this amazing journalism course in ninth grade.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.840]   I went to an alternative high school
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   and the teacher was named Calvin Shaw.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.680]   And he was just like,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.720]   I ended up taking his class all four years.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.240]   And he used to let me actually leave school.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.760]   I didn't like going to school.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.880]   So he'd let me basically go around Seattle
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.720]   and do different interviews with people
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.960]   as long as I could come back by the end of the day
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.000]   and write a story for his class.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.880]   And he'd mark me as present.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.280]   So the first article that I wrote
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.520]   was about the Silk Road and the deep web.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.360]   'Cause you know, as a ninth grader,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   when I discovered the hidden wiki,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.160]   I thought that I was like really tapping
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.240]   into like the most secret society,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   elite level black market in the world.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.120]   And so if you remember, they had that hidden wiki link
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.200]   it was like hire a hit man.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.160]   And so I messaged them and I was like,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.240]   all right, I wanna get someone killed in my school.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.040]   Like how much is it gonna cost me?
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.960]   And I published my interview with the hidden wiki hit man
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.200]   who was probably a fed or something, but who knows.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.960]   And that my first article was called like,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   inside the deep web, a conversation with a hit man.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.480]   - That's nice.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.080]   I mean, you're fearless even then.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.320]   - I mean, I was hiding behind a Tor browser.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.720]   So there's not much fear to be had.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.880]   - Oh, so it was anonymous.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.280]   - It was anonymous, but I did publish it under my name.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.180]   So you're right, I could have been in danger.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.440]   - I also saw that you said you took too many shrooms
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.320]   when you were young and that led you to have
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.880]   hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, HPPD.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.320]   Can you explain what this is?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.740]   - Well, that condition is classified
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.020]   by persistent visual snow, floaters, morphing objects.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.640]   Like I see them right now, I see them all the time.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.820]   - The snow's in the room.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.240]   - The snow is definitely in the room, it's all over you.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.160]   And basically, it wasn't that I took too many shrooms.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.000]   I think that it was, I took,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   I took about an eighth of seni-essence mushrooms,
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.280]   which are the ones that come from the earth
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.720]   instead of cow shit.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.960]   And I took an eighth of those at my friend Toby's house.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.940]   And, which is a normal amount, but I was in eighth grade.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.880]   So I woke up the next morning with these extreme,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.600]   you know, visual distortions.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.560]   And I thought that it would go away.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.780]   I tried to make it go away, but there was,
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.200]   there's really no cure for HPPD.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.160]   It's a lifelong condition.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.280]   So it's just a matter of dealing with it
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   and realizing that it is only visual.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.520]   So when people ask me, "Hey, I have HPPD.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.840]   "How do I cope with it?"
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.420]   I say, "Remember that every other sense that you have,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.500]   "what you can hear, what you can taste,
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.920]   "you know, your feet on the ground,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.040]   "you're still on earth, you're still here."
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.080]   - Well, you said it's only visual.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.720]   And yes, gratitude for being alive at all is great.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.200]   But you said that this led you
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.140]   into some dark psychological places
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.400]   like depersonalization disorder.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.220]   - Yeah.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.640]   Depersonalization is the feeling that you are not real,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.440]   but that reality still exists.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.260]   Derealization is the idea that reality itself
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.100]   is an illusion created by your mind
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.920]   and that you're the only person alive.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.040]   And that everything that your brain is projecting
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.200]   to your visual cortex is a lie
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.400]   and that you're the only living human being.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.600]   - Both are pretty intense.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.880]   - HPPD creates both of those things.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.900]   And so when I've talked to people who have the condition,
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.120]   it's really either or.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.120]   But more than 70% of people with HPPD
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.760]   fall into either category.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.520]   They're both coping mechanisms for the,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.820]   I don't know what really happens.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.580]   I talked to a researcher once named Dr. Abraham.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.040]   He lives in upstate New York.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.880]   He's the leading scientist when it comes to HPPD research.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.480]   He's the only one who actually seems to care
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.000]   about finding a cure.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.920]   And the only known treatment right now
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.160]   is alcohol and benzodiaphines.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.000]   - That's not good.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.360]   - Right, so alcoholism,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.400]   something that came into my life pretty early.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.640]   Alcohol abuse as a result of that experience
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.720]   because that helps with the visual symptoms,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.120]   makes some of the static go away.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.480]   Never tried benzos though.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.820]   - So can you explain to me where in that spectrum you are?
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.060]   So do you sometimes have a sense that you're not real?
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.900]   - Sometimes.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.880]   - And something else is not real?
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.320]   Like the reality's not real?
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   - Yeah, I experience it all the time.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.640]   But like I said, my job helps with that
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.200]   because I get to feel like,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.560]   when you seek out extremes to a certain extent
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.200]   and you put yourself on the front lines of intense events,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.240]   whether it be politically or socially,
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.160]   or just dive into deep fringe subcultures,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.120]   you get this feeling that you're real.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.320]   And being filmed is also confirmation,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.020]   if you can look at the MP4 file,
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.400]   that you're in fact living here on Earth.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.860]   - Confirming that you were in it with reality
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.400]   by watching yourself on video.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   - Exactly.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.280]   - So is that basically the engine
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.880]   behind all the extreme interviews you've done?
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.160]   - Well, I got HPPD around the same time
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.920]   that I began this journalism course in ninth grade.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.520]   So I sort of always used journalism
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.680]   as a therapeutic mechanism to deal with
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.640]   some of these symptoms, especially depersonalization.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.000]   There's some pretty good illustrations
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.680]   of what it feels like.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.360]   Kind of feels like you're trapped behind your eyes,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.480]   or that you're just this nebulous soul
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.800]   that's trapped in a flesh suit
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.280]   that you're not really a part of.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.120]   You're sort of puppeteering a flesh and bone skin suit.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.960]   - Trapped, or just the ability to step outside of yourself?
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.760]   - You feel like your soul is not something
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.960]   that is connected to your body.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.760]   It's something living in your head.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.080]   It's really hard to explain to people
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.200]   who haven't gone through derealization or depersonalization,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.320]   but if you go on support groups,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.600]   they always say, "How do I break free from behind my eyes?"
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   Like, just dark stuff like that.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.680]   - Oh, so you're trapped.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.320]   I mean, there's a higher state of being through meditation
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.720]   that you can kind of step outside of yourself,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.160]   but this is not that.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.760]   - Unfortunately, it was kind of the meditative path,
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.000]   or the Eastern path that I took,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.440]   and kind of fused that with psychedelic culture in Seattle
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.360]   that took me down the psychedelic use rabbit hole
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.400]   in the first place.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.440]   So I'd say it all started with Siddhartha.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.320]   - Siddhartha, that's a good book.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.760]   Have you done shrooms since then?
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.040]   - No, I don't really do psychedelic drugs,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.320]   but a lot of people think that I'm against them,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.920]   which I'm not, it just doesn't work for me.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.800]   If it works for you, I'm sure that can be really fun,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   especially, I know there's lots of therapeutic uses
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.960]   for acid and ketamine and psilocybin,
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.400]   but I personally abstain from those kind of,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.520]   anything psychotropic, I try to stay away from.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.400]   - Drinking a bit?
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.800]   - Well, yeah, I mean, I didn't drink at all
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.480]   before I had the HPPD stuff,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.120]   and I would have drank later in life,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.680]   but definitely like 14, 15, every day after school,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.800]   I'd drink a 40 ounce of Mickey's.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.720]   It's like a, it kind of looks like Old English,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.640]   but the bottle's green,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.440]   and it has a hornet on the side of it.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.660]   Just kind of became a ritual,
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.960]   just to deal with the anxiety of that situation.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.920]   - And it made the snow go away?
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.140]   - Yeah, alcohol really works to suppress HPPD symptoms.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.600]   - So you said you hated classes in school,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.960]   except that journalism class.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.080]   - Okay, we need to clear this up,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.160]   because on my Wikipedia page, for some reason,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.440]   for Andrew Callahan Early Life, it says,
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.680]   "Andrew hated every single class except for one."
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.520]   So I've had a bunch of teachers who are super cool,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.440]   like this guy Tim, my astronomy professor at ninth grade,
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   Mrs. Zanetti, my creative writing teacher in sixth grade,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.920]   and this really cool dude at my college in New Orleans
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.640]   named Charles Cannon, who taught me a class
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.320]   called New Orleans Mythology.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.960]   My three favorite classes, besides my journalism class,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.500]   and they all hit me up, and they're like,
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.740]   "Hey man, saw you said you hated every class.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.300]   "Sorry I couldn't be everything that you wanted me to be."
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.500]   And so I just want to say, shout out to all those teachers,
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.220]   I didn't hate every class.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.340]   The point that I was making is that
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.460]   being forced into the institution of school so young,
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.140]   and having to take common core classes like biology,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.780]   dissecting frogs, history of the Han Dynasty,
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.840]   stuff like that that I didn't want to learn,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.900]   but I had to learn multiple times.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.460]   I mean, I learned about the dynastic cycle in ancient China
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.740]   three separate times at three different schools,
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.140]   and I was like, who is writing this curriculum,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.640]   and why is it so important that I understand this process?
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.900]   The part that makes school difficult,
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.700]   especially in college, is that you have people
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.980]   just going to school just to get the degree,
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.860]   who don't really know exactly what they're interested in,
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.500]   and they don't even have time to figure that out,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.060]   'cause they're in a business program,
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.420]   or a communications program with no specific interest.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.700]   - Well I think if you want to do school right,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.620]   take on every single subject that you're forced into,
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.020]   it's like the David Foster Wallace,
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.180]   just be unboreable by it.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.800]   Just really go in as if ancient Chinese dynasties
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.540]   are the most interesting thing you could possibly learn.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.740]   - And it is somewhat interesting,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.540]   the Silk Road, and the Great Wall,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.500]   and terracotta soldiers and stuff.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   But I'm just saying, when I got to college,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.060]   I signed up for journalism school, right?
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.660]   And I didn't get to take a media class
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.820]   until the second semester,
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.660]   and I had to take everything prior to that,
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.380]   and I'd already spent so much time,
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.380]   I just think the excruciating boredom of schooling
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.580]   left a bad taste in my mouth.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.660]   But there was individual classes that I liked a lot.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.420]   - Yeah, there should be some choice,
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.100]   or maybe a lot of choice, even at the level of high school,
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.140]   for what kind of classes you pursue.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.580]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.020]   - And you're also saying so,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   Wikipedia's not always perfectly right.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.800]   - No, but it's just interesting,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.460]   because I've said so much in podcasts,
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.420]   but that's what they isolated.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.580]   And I've gotten that question before,
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.020]   which I understand, it's the first thing
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.940]   on my Wikipedia page,
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.260]   but it makes me sound like a super hater.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.620]   Have you ever seen this Instagram page
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.180]   called Depths of Wikipedia?
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.020]   - Oh, it's great.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.380]   - Oh, it's so good, dude.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.660]   - You said you loved journalism.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.340]   What did you love about journalism?
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.700]   - I mean-- - What hooked you?
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.300]   - On a basic level, everybody wants media coverage, right?
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.420]   Everyone likes to be on camera
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.180]   and get exposure for whatever they're doing.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.460]   And so being a journalist and being almost like a portal
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.780]   for exposure for people,
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.100]   allows you to be on the front row of everything
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.100]   that you want to be a part of.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.060]   You get to be in the front row for history as it's unfolding,
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.580]   because everyone wants to be covered.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.940]   So being a journalist gives you a ticket
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.020]   to everywhere that you want to go in life.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.460]   And so it allows you to step into different realities almost
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.780]   and then go back to yours.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.140]   And it just keeps life interesting.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.660]   - Buy the ticket, take the ride.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.300]   Hunter S. Thompson, is he up there
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.780]   as one of the influences?
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.900]   Who are your influences?
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.500]   - I think the early Daily Show was so good.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.260]   Sacha Baron Cohen, huge influence.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.900]   I mean, that was like, the Ali G Show especially.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.540]   I think Louis Theroux's broadcasts on BBC were great.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.140]   I was really into Hunter S. Thompson too,
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.080]   but not really until college.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.220]   You know, I really like a particular Hunter S. Thompson book
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.260]   called "The Great Shark Hunt",
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.620]   where he covers the Ruben Salazar murder by LAPD
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.060]   or LA Sheriff's Department in Boyle Heights in the '70s.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   And his relationship with his lawyer, Oscar Acosta,
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.740]   and that whole saga is great.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.440]   Fear and loathing, I like,
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.300]   but not as much as his straightforward reporting.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.020]   'Cause there's the Gonzo side of Hunter,
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.580]   where he's like saying he's taking drugs and seeing shit.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.740]   And there's the other side of him,
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.780]   which is like an actual reporter
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.940]   interested in telling a story that has news value.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.460]   So it's two different lanes for him.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   - There is something about you that makes people wanna say
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.860]   you're the Hunter S. Thompson of this generation.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.540]   And I don't think they mean the drugs.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.020]   I think they mean some kind of non-standard
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.820]   willingness to explore the extremes of humanity.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.960]   And like almost a celebration of the extremes of humanity.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.100]   - Yeah, well, that's a very kind comparison.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.460]   I'll get there one day, maybe.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.040]   I just went to Aspen on a little
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.100]   Hunter S. Thompson recon trip
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.980]   to go check out the Woody Creek Tavern,
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.020]   which is the spot that he,
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.980]   it was like his bar near his cabin.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.500]   And it was pretty cool to see.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.820]   Unfortunately, it's kind of turned into not a dive bar now,
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.260]   but it's a sit-down sort of country restaurant.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.100]   But it was cool.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.980]   I expected to see a bunch of gnarly Hunter S. Thompson types
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.500]   doing speeds.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.260]   (laughing)
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.100]   - Just doing drugs.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.740]   I mean, drugs and alcohol is all part of it somehow.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.560]   - Yeah.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.340]   - And so it opens a gateway
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.060]   to a deeper understanding of humanity.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.140]   - But I will say, though, as someone now
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.740]   who doesn't party like I did when I was younger,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.900]   it's not as important as I thought it was, you know?
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.620]   - Yeah, I'm conflicted on this.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.260]   I'm good friends with a lot of people
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260]   that say alcohol is really bad for you.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.980]   And I believe that too.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.260]   But there's something that I just, as an introvert,
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.100]   as a person who has a lot of anxiety,
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.960]   for me, alcohol has opened doors
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.900]   of just opening myself up to the world more.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.780]   - Oh, I'm actually a fan of alcohol, moderate drinking.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.420]   But I'm saying my life before,
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.940]   I would say 2019, 2018 especially,
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.380]   there was the chaos on camera,
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.520]   but then there was my private life,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.900]   which was chaotic partying all the time.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.740]   - Oh, I see.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.100]   - I convinced myself, much like Hunter did,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.620]   that that was the secret sauce in the core,
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.540]   the spiritual, in my spiritual core,
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.060]   that gave me the creativity.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.180]   But then I cut out a lot of that stuff,
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.980]   and I'm just as creative.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.280]   And it's interesting that a lot of,
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.180]   I think one of the hardest parts about addiction
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.020]   is that if you're a functioning,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.380]   highly creative addict of any kind,
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.940]   your brain and the addictive part of your brain
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.340]   convinces yourself that it's all part of the cross purpose,
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.980]   and that it has this symbiotic,
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.200]   you know, inspirational thing going on.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.980]   It's not true.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.340]   It can be, but it's typically not.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.940]   - Yeah, it's not a requirement.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.780]   - Right.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.600]   - You can sometimes channel,
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.100]   you can sometimes leverage all those things
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.140]   for your creativity,
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.500]   but the creative engine, it lives outside of that.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.420]   - Like, have you read Hunter's daily routine
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.140]   in the year up to his death?
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.600]   It was like 15 grapefruits and eight ball of Coke,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.460]   and just a certain amount of shotgun shells
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.260]   for him to fire into the sky every morning.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.100]   There's no way,
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.900]   he didn't do anything creative in those final years.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.740]   - Yeah.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.260]   - But, so the creativity goes away,
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.420]   and gradually you just become like a party animal,
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.300]   like Andy Dick.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.740]   - A caricature of yourself.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.580]   - Yeah.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.620]   - I mean, that's why life is interesting.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.780]   You make all kinds of choices,
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.260]   and sometimes you can have,
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.220]   create works of genius in a short amount of time
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.940]   based on drugs and no drugs.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.140]   Einstein had that miracle year
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.780]   where he published several incredible papers
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.100]   in one year, 1905.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.860]   - Did he do drugs before that?
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.260]   - Lots of Coke, and--
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.240]   - (laughs) I was like, I believed you for a second.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.020]   I'm like, did Einstein have blow?
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.860]   I don't think he did.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.940]   - How do you think he gets that hair?
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.760]   Come on.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.600]   - It's true.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.540]   - I'm just asking questions.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.580]   - High confidence hair.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.420]   - Look into it.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.240]   - Yeah.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.080]   - You know what I mean?
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.060]   - Yeah, well, no, he's a well put together,
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.180]   sexy young man.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.400]   The hair came later.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.500]   - Yeah, was Albert Einstein attractive as a teenager?
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.340]   No, that's not teenager.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.140]   Was he attractive as a young man?
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.180]   - Sexually attractive?
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.020]   - I don't, I mean--
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.040]   - I'm turned on by Einstein at all ages.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.940]   I don't discriminate.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.100]   But are you more turned on by the work that he did
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.220]   or his physical being?
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.420]   - No, sometimes I fantasize what it would be like
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.500]   to be in the arms of Einstein.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.740]   I could even get that out.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.940]   - Yeah, in the arms of Einstein.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.940]   - Yeah, just I wanna feel safe.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.480]   - It's a good idea for a rom-com.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.700]   (laughs)
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.140]   - To be a little more serious, like general relativity,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.140]   that space-time can be unified and curved by gravity
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.340]   is an incredibly wild and difficult idea to come up with.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.620]   Like it's a really, really difficult thing to imagine
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.100]   given how well Newtonian classical mechanics physics
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.260]   works for predicting how stuff happens on Earth.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:37.260]   To think like that gravity can morph space-time,
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:43.940]   both space and time,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.100]   and it permeates the entire universe.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.300]   It's a field.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.100]   It's a really wild idea to come up as one human on Earth
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.460]   to intuit that is really, really, really difficult.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.940]   And it's really sad to me
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.940]   that he didn't get a Nobel Prize for that.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.140]   - Was there people saying he was crazy when he was around?
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.100]   Or was he universally recognized as like an OG of his?
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.260]   - No, I think once the papers came out,
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.740]   he was widely recognized as a true genius.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.620]   But before that, he wasn't recognized.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.780]   He had a really difficult--
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.640]   - So back now, where does a black hole go?
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.580]   Like after something gets sucked into it?
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.300]   - You mean is it a portal to another place,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.140]   that kind of thing?
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.960]   - Yeah.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.260]   - No, well, we don't know.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.100]   It could be.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.620]   It could be that the universe is kind of like Swiss cheese
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.780]   full of black holes.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.700]   There's something called Hawking radiation
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.380]   where because of quantum mechanics,
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.260]   the information leaks out of a black hole.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.540]   So it is possible to escape a black hole.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.100]   There's a lot of interesting questions there.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.620]   - I hope we get to the bottom of that.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.060]   - And there's a supermassive black hole
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.980]   at the center of our galaxy,
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.840]   which doesn't seem to scare physicists,
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.940]   but it terrifies me.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.980]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.500]   Astronomy can be terrifying.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.060]   - Yeah, we're all like orbiting.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.420]   I mean, we're not just orbiting the sun,
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.980]   but the sun is part of the solar system,
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.060]   is part of the galaxy,
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   and it's all orbiting a gigantic black hole.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.180]   - Have you ever spoke to someone who's been to outer space?
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.880]   - Jeff Bezos.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.220]   He flew his own rocket.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.500]   - Wow.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.380]   That's pretty cool.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.320]   - Astronaut that's been to deep space, no.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.740]   Well, maybe I've spoken to an alien
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.780]   that just hasn't admitted it.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.820]   - I wanna do a research paper,
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.020]   like a report about space madness.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.620]   You know, it's supposed to be this like
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.940]   torturous feeling that you get
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.180]   when you look away from Earth and into the abyss
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.740]   after you've exited Earth's orbit or whatever.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.540]   Because there's one specific psychiatrist
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.900]   who knows how to deal with space madness,
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.700]   and I wanna figure out how,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.260]   interview people with it.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.100]   - Is this a real thing?
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.660]   Like, is there a Wikipedia article on it?
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.660]   - Yes, look up space madness treatment.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.980]   - Now I don't trust Wikipedia after what you told me, so.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.340]   - I know, they think I hate classes.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.860]   - I thought you meant more about
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.780]   the fact that you're isolated out in space,
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.700]   that we need social connection and it's difficult.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.660]   - Yeah, I think it's just a feeling
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.300]   of extreme insignificance that you might get sometimes
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.380]   when you look at the night sky,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.020]   but it's that times 1,000.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.980]   It's like an existential void that's created
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.620]   after looking into the abyss
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.980]   and then realizing how small Earth is in the grand scheme.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.660]   You just start to really have a strange new perception
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.620]   about the pointlessness of existence.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.100]   - I don't need to go to space for that.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.980]   - I mean, only a handful of people have been to space,
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.220]   but I'm sure they're all pretty well off,
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.940]   so the psychiatrist has to be in the multi-millions.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.340]   - Well, technically, we're all in space
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.120]   'cause Earth is in space, but so,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.480]   I wonder if you have to go to space
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.900]   to talk to the psychiatrist.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.740]   - Yeah, probably so.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.580]   - Well, technically, we're all in space,
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.820]   so he can't, that's a boundary he can't have.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.060]   - But not everyone believes that,
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.280]   as you've seen from my work, probably.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.540]   - You're right, and those are important people
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.020]   that are asking important questions.
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.420]   - Yeah.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.780]   - You hitchhiked across US for 70 days when you were 19.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.620]   - Right.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.440]   - Tell the story of that.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.980]   - Well, this sort of connects to what I was talking about
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.780]   with the boredom of school and these common core classes.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.380]   So, after my first year of school,
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.460]   where I lived in the dorms,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.540]   like an old school dormitory building
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.180]   at a school in New Orleans called Loyola University,
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.580]   I wanted to just do something.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.540]   I felt so bored.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.020]   I was working for the school newspaper
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.840]   for that whole first year, it was called The Maroon,
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.880]   and I didn't have the ability to write my own stories.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.200]   Like, I had to defer to an older editor,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   and they would give me stories to write about,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.060]   and they were all about on-campus happenings,
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.840]   like the Pope visits New Orleans,
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.800]   or glass recycling to be restored in the French Quarter,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.180]   or hoverboards banned on campus due to safety concerns.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.320]   And it just kind of felt like,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.660]   all right, I kind of wanted to be a gonzo reporter.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.120]   I'm not sure if working my way up
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.240]   through the traditional newsroom hierarchy
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.800]   is gonna get me to that point.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.620]   So I started reading a bunch of old hobo literature,
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.900]   you know, like post-World War II vagabonding stuff,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.040]   and there was this book called "Vagabonding in America"
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.600]   by an old hobo named Ed Byrne.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.340]   And I read this, and it just basically,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.740]   obviously some of it was outdated.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.440]   They had stuff in there like the hobo code,
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.880]   like, oh, this moniker on the side of a fence
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.220]   means this person has free soup or something like that.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.280]   They didn't have stuff like that.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.800]   But what it did tell me-- - That's great.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.440]   - It told me about train stop towns,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.900]   like Dunsmuir and places in Montana
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.180]   where there was a friendly attitude toward drifters,
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.160]   and that still persists from the '60s and '70s to this day,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.440]   even though, in my opinion,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.120]   movies like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.040]   have ruined hitchhiking culture in America
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.600]   because now everyone thinks we're gonna, you know,
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.420]   decapitate them if they pick you up.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.020]   So after my final day of courses at Loyola,
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.500]   I literally left all of my belongings inside my dorm
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.180]   and took the streetcar to the Greyhound station,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.200]   got a one-way ticket to Baton Rouge,
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.680]   and I was like, I'm gonna hitchhike
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.420]   across the whole country back to Seattle with no money.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.760]   And that was the plan, and it worked out.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.600]   - I love it.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.000]   I traveled across the United States before
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.140]   in a similar kind of plan, 'cause you went--
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.700]   - Were you on the Silver Dog?
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.680]   (laughs)
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.960]   It's the Greyhound bus.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.120]   - Greyhound is pretty nice.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.560]   - That's a step above hitchhiking.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.200]   - That's way better than hitchhiking, so I don't--
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.080]   - Hitchhiking, Greyhound, Amtrak, airlines.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.000]   - Amtrak, no, that's the leadest.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.480]   - What's in between Greyhound and Amtrak?
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.640]   (laughs)
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.040]   A car, that's what it is.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.760]   - Yeah, it's a car, yeah, a shitty car.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.280]   - Okay, cool.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.840]   - I lived in a shitty car.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.880]   - You lived in a car?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.560]   - Yeah, when I was driving across the United States.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.800]   - Solo?
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   - With a friend, I'm solo, and I would eat cold soup.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.560]   - I love cold soup.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.680]   What I like is the cold chickpeas in a can.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.560]   Get the water out and just dump 'em in your mouth.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.640]   Those are good, beef jerky.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.560]   Kind bars, kind bars are really good for the road.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.520]   - Yeah, I mean, all of that is great,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.680]   but too much of it is not great.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.720]   Like, too much cold soup, not great.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.680]   Too much beef jerky.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   - So what was the route you took?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.280]   Was it Chicago across, or was it Philadelphia across?
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.520]   - Philadelphia across.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.440]   - To LA, or where?
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.120]   - San Diego's where we ended up,
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.560]   but it was a zigzagging, went up to Chicago,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.320]   and then all the way down to Texas.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.920]   - So you went Philly, through Appalachia,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.080]   up to the Midwest.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.920]   - Yep.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.600]   - Through the Southwest, down to San Diego?
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.480]   - No, no, no, I went straight down to Texas,
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.960]   all the way down to the Midwest, so like.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.520]   - But did you cut from Texas West
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.240]   through New Mexico and Arizona to get to San Diego?
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.120]   - That is the best road trip place.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.160]   Interstate 40, like Albuquerque, Flagstaff,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   Vegas, Kingman, the Mojave Desert, Yuma, doesn't get better.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.080]   - Yeah, I mean, and you're a kid, so you don't care,
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.720]   and you were throwing caution to the wind,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.960]   and I met some crazy, crazy people.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.480]   - It gives me some sanity, like,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.000]   whenever I'm feeling kind of out of control,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.040]   or, you know, like, bummed out,
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.320]   I just remember that the road is still out there.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.720]   The open road never goes anywhere,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.620]   and it's kind of like a, I see like an invisible door
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.040]   in the corner of the room all the time
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   that makes me more comfortable,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.880]   'cause I'm like, hey, at the end of the day,
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.320]   if I'm bummed out, I can go hit the road,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.520]   and I'm sure there's gonna be a fun time ahead.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.760]   - Yeah, get that Greyhound ticket, and go.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.480]   - I would say Silver Dog, half,
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.960]   because sometimes I gotta ride the dog
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.620]   when no one will pick me up.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.920]   There's some places in the country
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.960]   where no one's gonna pick you up.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.720]   Kansas, Missouri, they're not gonna do it.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.880]   - Maybe you're not charming enough.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.720]   You thought about that?
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.360]   - I was 19, fresh, clean-shaven.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.880]   I was pretty charming, I'd say.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.240]   But the older you get, the harder it is to hitchhike,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.260]   because they think you're like an escaped convict,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.680]   or some type of like psycho wanderer.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.120]   And some of these people are like what we call Punishers.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.840]   It's people who never stop talking.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.280]   And so they see someone hitchhiking,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.920]   and they're like, yes, I'm gonna talk at this person.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.240]   And you can tell, their eyes are wide.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.080]   They're like, what's up?
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.000]   And you're like, oh, shit.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.720]   So it's six hours of just like, oh, cool, nice.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.560]   - That's rough.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.720]   - You're right, you're right.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.520]   I like people that are comfortable in silence.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.680]   - Yeah, but then that also raises the question,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.800]   are they about to kill me?
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.920]   - I think that's a you problem, not a--
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.200]   - You know what's funny is almost everybody
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.720]   who picked me up when I was hitchhiking
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.120]   was like a day laborer.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.560]   It was almost all Mexican day laborers who picked me up.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.380]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.880]   - 'Cause I think that in some places down there,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.600]   that's a typical thing to do, hitchhike to work.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.560]   A lot of people don't have cars,
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.840]   but they still have to get to their jobs.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.720]   So a lot of people ask me, hey, where should I drop you off?
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   Where's your job at?
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.400]   And I'm like, my job is to explore.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.600]   And they were down with it.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.520]   - See, like for me, it was really easy
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.920]   because you just say like,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.900]   I'm traveling across the United States.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.960]   And I think people love that idea and they wanna help.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.800]   They romanticize it 'cause they also have
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.000]   that invisible door.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.360]   Everybody has that invisible door.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.280]   I just wanna go.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.500]   - So you know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't think--
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.280]   - It can anchor you a bit just to remind you
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.580]   that every pattern that I've fallen into is voluntary
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.000]   and it's for my own stability and mental health.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.720]   - Well, that's why I'm like renting everything
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.960]   and I'm making sure that tomorrow I could just go.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.080]   I gave away everything I owned twice in my life.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.680]   Just very like, I'm ready to go tonight.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.640]   Let's go.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.760]   - What's the hardest item you've had to part with
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.600]   in this experience?
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   - There's nothing.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.880]   - You've never had a material object
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.080]   that was really hard to let go of?
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.280]   - No.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.160]   - So you'd give that watch to somebody if it meant--
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.120]   - No, this, you're right.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.960]   You're right.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.780]   That's probably the only,
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.800]   I've never had to let go of that though.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.680]   That's the only thing I own.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.600]   This means a lot to me, but everything else.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.080]   But then again, 'cause okay,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.880]   this watch is given to me by Rogan,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.280]   who's become a close friend.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.120]   But whenever I romanticize the notion
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.500]   that this watch means a lot to me,
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.340]   he's like, "Don't worry about it.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.640]   "I'll just get you the same one again."
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.480]   - Yeah.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.300]   (laughing)
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.140]   - I was like, "God damn it."
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.640]   - It's a pretty sick-ass gift though.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.920]   - Yeah, it's pretty sick.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.840]   I'm not usually a gift guy,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.880]   but when somebody you look up to
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.740]   kind of gives you a thing,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.180]   it's a nice little symbol of that relationship.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.340]   So it's nice.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.720]   But other than that, no.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.600]   But even this, whatever.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.940]   The relationship is what matters.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.480]   The human is what matters, not the--
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.520]   - I agree 100%.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   - You had something like this?
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.040]   - Not really.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.000]   I mean, there was a hard drive that I lost
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.240]   that had all of my childhood pictures on it
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.440]   and stuff like that that I think about all the time
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.140]   because I left it on a train.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.580]   And certain memories, you think about it,
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.560]   you just get pissed off.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.240]   I just think to myself, "Someone has that somewhere."
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.680]   I have dreams about reuniting with the hard drive.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.100]   - You and Hunter Biden have a similar kind of dream.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.040]   (laughing)
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.800]   - I don't think he wants to reunite with that one.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.640]   - Okay.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.480]   - Dude, it's crazy.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   All he did was smoke crack, right?
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.240]   Or was there more stuff going on?
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.080]   - I think there's prostitutes involved.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.440]   - Oh, okay, whatever.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.720]   - I think you gotta look into it.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.860]   - I think I have to look into it too.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.680]   (laughing)
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.520]   - I don't know.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.980]   (laughing)
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.780]   - Was Kerouac, Jack Kerouac, somebody that was
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.060]   an inspiration at all in this road trip?
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.220]   Did you even know who that is?
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.060]   The B generation?
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.960]   - No, I didn't know who it was.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.620]   And then after I did the, ultimately I wrote a book
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.860]   about my hitchhiking experience years later.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.620]   And everyone was like, "Have you read 'On the Road'?"
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.500]   And then, "On the Road," I probably heard the title
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.340]   of that book every day at least 10 times for two years.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.380]   And I'm sure Kerouac is a great guy.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.220]   (laughing)
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.700]   I mean, I just don't, I'm not too familiar
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.860]   with the B generation.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.700]   - It's a great book.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.740]   It's a, you read it or no?
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.660]   - I refuse to read it.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.980]   People even have gifted it to me, being like,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.860]   "Hey man, you're gonna love this one."
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.700]   And I'm like, "Is that 'On the Road'?"
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.260]   If I, honestly, people have given me a book
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.660]   with wrapping paper on it, and they're like,
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   "This is right up your alley."
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.380]   I was like, "That's fucking 'On the Road,' isn't it?"
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.300]   (laughing)
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.300]   - Give you a different cover?
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.880]   - Yeah, no, I'm like, "Anything but that."
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.940]   But I'm sure it's a great book.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.240]   It's just the comparison thing drives me crazy.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.220]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.100]   - Respect, big respect to Kerouac.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.500]   Would never speak down on the whole,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.140]   anyone in the B generation.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.820]   - What are some interesting moments you remember
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.200]   from that, those 70 days?
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.180]   - Man, there was so much.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.580]   I mean, getting mistaken for a gay prostitute
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.300]   on my first hitchhiking ride in Louisiana was pretty funny.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.980]   - Where did you come from and where did you go?
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.260]   - Well, I mean, the journey began in Baton Rouge,
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.940]   and the first destination was Houston,
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.020]   which is about four and a half hours west
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.020]   on Interstate 10.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.340]   So I'm in Crowley, Louisiana, I'm on the side of the road,
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.700]   and I guess this was a cruising truck stop
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.660]   that was known for being a place where male lot lizards
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.780]   would go to procure clients.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.640]   And I was there.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.820]   - Lot lizards are-
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.740]   - It's a derogatory term in trucker culture
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.660]   for a prostitute who hangs out at the Love's
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.300]   or Pilot Flying J, large interstate truck stops.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.820]   Now, trucker culture, as it once was,
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.080]   is pretty much finished because of the live stream cameras
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.900]   they have inside of the trucks now,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.860]   so you can't snort Sudafed or pick up anybody.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.860]   Can't even pick up a hitchhiker or you get fired.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.200]   - Killed all the romance.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.540]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.300]   The old school outlaw trucker lifestyle,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.060]   unless you're an owner-operator who's not even in a union,
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.260]   which is like a real cowboy way to haul loads,
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.100]   you can't do that.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.540]   - You were mistaken for a lot lizard.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.900]   - Mistaken for a lot lizard by a small man from Honduras
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.480]   with a spiky leather jacket covered in studs.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.320]   - Nice.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.060]   - I don't speak any English, but you know,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.820]   I thought he was just, you know, a nice guy.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.080]   And then he pulled over at a...
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.940]   There's private theaters in the South
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.660]   where they have confessional booths set up
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.200]   and they have three channels and people go in there and,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.040]   you know...
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.860]   - It's porn?
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.620]   - Yeah, people go in there and, you know,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.460]   please themselves.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.280]   - That's right.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.080]   So, I thought he was taking me to one of those.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.000]   I was like, all right, cool, man, yeah, like, you know,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.080]   this guy wants to go jerk off,
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.300]   I'm just gonna wait in the car, it's all good,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.320]   I don't discriminate.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.040]   But then I was like, he buys a booth for me
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.760]   and I'm like, okay, you know,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.420]   not really in the mood to watch porn with this random guy.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.720]   So, he gets in the same booth as me
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.680]   and he starts jerking off right next to me.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.400]   And I'm like, oh man, like, I don't think this is chill.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.920]   I'm like, dude, can you stop?
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.000]   He stopped jacking off and he's like, what do you mean?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.680]   Like, I thought this is what you wanna do,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.440]   like, I have money for you, like, what's up?
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.880]   And I was like, oh no, I'm just a regular guy.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.640]   And he was super cool about it.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.080]   He started laughing, he was like, oh, my bad, man.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.880]   I thought you were, you know, selling something.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.480]   I said, no, and he said, oh, it's all good.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.560]   And he gave me a ride all the way to Houston.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.400]   - That's great.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.160]   - Yeah, we talked about anything except that
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.400]   for the rest of the car ride.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.800]   - That's great, I was just rolled with it.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.640]   Oh, sorry about that.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.080]   - I mean, I had about a foot and a half on this guy,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.440]   so I wasn't too scared.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.180]   I also had like a knife in my pocket,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.560]   but I didn't wanna stab him,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.920]   especially not at a place like that.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.000]   - And you were still, that didn't like,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.840]   leave a bad taste in your mouth?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.920]   - Well, I figured that can't happen again.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.040]   It can't keep happening.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:02.880]   So I was like, all right,
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.960]   if I got this out of the way the first ride,
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.760]   the following rides are gonna be spectacular.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   - Yeah, I mean, who among us
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.320]   have not been mistaken for a lot lizard?
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.640]   - It's a fact, you heard it here first.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.480]   - What else?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.440]   What, there's some interesting, beautiful people
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.680]   that you've met along the way.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.840]   - Well, I used the app Couchsurfing
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.720]   to find places to stay. - Nice, I remember Couchsurfing.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.800]   - Now you can only submit
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.000]   like five Couchsurfing requests a day,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.180]   unless you're a premium member,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.880]   which means you also host people.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.000]   - Couchsurfing's still around?
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.360]   - Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.440]   But it's evolved obviously into a different thing.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.840]   - Airbnb is a kind of competitor to that, right?
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.620]   - Couchsurfing is free though.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.460]   - Right.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.440]   - So Couchsurfing, they call it like the CS community.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.520]   So basically there'd be these like Couchsurfing super hosts
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.340]   in different cities.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.520]   Like there was one in Santa Fe,
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.080]   this firefighter dude who had like 15 other Couchsurfers
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   there chilling.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.740]   - Nice.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.580]   - So I would do it everywhere.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.480]   A lot of them were Catholics, you know?
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.000]   So it was their way of giving back.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.120]   A lot of them were nudists.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.480]   And so I didn't realize that there's a small little section
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.400]   at the bottom of someone's Couchsurfing profile
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.960]   that says clothing optional.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.800]   - Yes.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.760]   - And that means if you go there,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.800]   I thought it meant like it's cool
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.940]   if you walk to the bathroom in your underwear.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.880]   No, if you go there, everyone's gonna be butt naked.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.920]   So I made that mistake a few times.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.880]   Not that I'm anti-nudist, but I didn't wanna, you know,
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.480]   I wasn't ready to take that leap of faith.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.680]   And yeah, it was just great.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.760]   Couchsurfing hosts were amazing.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.720]   But that was just great.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.460]   It was this constant thing where I felt like,
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.800]   wow, people are so welcoming.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.960]   I'm not having to pay them a dollar for this experience.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.360]   - Yeah, I love Couchsurfing.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.040]   For like, again, for me being an introvert,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.360]   just crashing on a person's couch,
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   being essentially forced into a great conversation is great.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.200]   - Yeah.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.760]   The one thing that gets exhausting about hitchhiking
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.160]   is constantly thanking people, you know,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.400]   being in like sort of constant superficial gratitude
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   everywhere all the time.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.520]   Like, oh, thanks for letting me sleep on your couch.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.440]   Thanks for the food.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.280]   - Yeah.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.920]   - Part of the reason I wanted to live in an RV
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.240]   later in life is to avoid having to constantly live
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.520]   in this like, thanks so much type of frequency,
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.000]   'cause it's exhausting to constantly, hey man, thanks.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.480]   - I think the shallowness of that interaction is exhausting,
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.600]   not just the thanks.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.720]   - Yeah, it was a true favor.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.560]   Of course, I love giving people gratitude for that.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.900]   But just this thing where everyone who picks you up,
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.560]   you know, you get eight rides a day,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.200]   you're like thanking eight people a day,
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.280]   like they're, you know, the second coming of Jesus.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.680]   You start to feel a little bit debased.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.560]   - What'd you learn about people from that journey?
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.360]   That's your first time really kind of going into it.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.140]   - That the American public is just so kind overall.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.000]   I mean, they're so like embracing, depending on who you are.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.460]   And specifically though, the Christian family people
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.680]   of the US who drive in minivans and have that fish sticker
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.720]   on the back where it's like Jesus fish,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.640]   and then they have the family sticker,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.880]   you know, where each member of the family
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.580]   is a stick figure.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.680]   Those people never picked me up
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.080]   and would flip me off with their whole family.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.320]   Sometimes they would throw full Dr. Peppers at me
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.400]   as a family while I stood on the side of the road.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   - As a family, together.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.040]   - They'd yell shit like, "Go to hell, hippie,"
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.840]   when I was on the side of the road.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.760]   And so it's weird that the most charitable
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.560]   Christian American family values people
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.400]   never gave me any charity or even conversation.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.040]   They were antagonizing me and saw me as like a hippie
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.120]   leftover from the '60s who needed to go to work,
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.020]   go to Vietnam.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.400]   I don't get it.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.760]   But the people who really extended a hand to me
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.840]   is people on the margins.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.440]   People working on seasonal visas,
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.360]   people whose cars have less than a quarter tank left,
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.880]   people struggling with addiction who saw me struggling,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.200]   or at least they thought that I was
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.360]   'cause they assumed I was hitchhiking,
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.480]   not out of adventure, but 'cause I had no car,
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   and were willing to sacrifice their day almost sometimes
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.700]   to take me exactly where I needed to go.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.720]   - That's beautiful, man.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.680]   I've had similar kind of experience,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.920]   that people who are struggling the most
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.200]   are the ones who are willing to help you
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.120]   when you're struggling.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.240]   - Yeah.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   - There's people in religious contexts
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.600]   and other kind of communities that just judge others
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.200]   because they've kind of constructed a value system
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.600]   where they're better than others
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.680]   because of that value system.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.480]   And that actually has a cascade that forces you
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   to actually be kind of a dick.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.600]   - Yeah, I never thought about it that way.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.440]   It's so true.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.200]   Do you think about morality and religion a lot?
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.160]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.800]   I've been to certain parts of the world
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.040]   where religion is really a big part of life.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:36.220]   I'm just always skeptical about tribes of people
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.800]   that believe a thing and believe they're better than others
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.400]   because they believe that thing.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.720]   That could be nations, that could be religions.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.560]   - Yeah.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.600]   - I mean, in Ukraine and in Russia,
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.440]   I've seen a lot of hate towards the other.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.280]   - Yeah.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.240]   - And that hate, I'm always very skeptical of
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.800]   'cause it could be used by powerful people
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.080]   to direct that hate just so the powerful people
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.400]   can maintain power and get money, that kind of stuff.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.320]   - It's a scary thing to see how easy it is
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.400]   for high up political people to mobilize the hate
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.880]   of just the average working person
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.480]   and can almost convince them
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.320]   to sabotage their own countrymen
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.800]   who they share more in common with
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.720]   than the politician they look up to
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.280]   just to advance the agenda of one party.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.480]   That's what we're seeing now.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.920]   - Are there some places in America
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.200]   that are better than others?
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   Can you speak negatively of like aforementioned Joe Rogan
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.800]   talk shit about Connecticut and that stuff?
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.240]   Can you pick a region in the United States
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.080]   you can talk shit about?
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.920]   - To talk shit about?
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.740]   Oh, for sure.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.080]   I mean.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.960]   - Or from that experience, let's just narrow it down to that.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.480]   - Oh, Colorado.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.320]   - Oh, jeez.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.140]   - Really?
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.680]   - I know so many people that love Colorado.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.600]   - Dude, Dallas, Denver.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.880]   I used to think Phoenix sucks, but I love Phoenix now.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.080]   The way they build these cities
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.600]   to just be so circular and massive, it's just like, stop it.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.680]   - You don't like circles?
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.240]   - I like grids, man.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.120]   - Oh, you're a grid guy.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.160]   - Manhattan, New Orleans, San Francisco.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.440]   - What is it about grids that bring out the worst in people?
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.800]   (laughing)
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.640]   Circles is where everyone just, there's a--
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.520]   - Everyone's just vibing out loose and goosey,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.440]   but the grid gets people locked in and hateful.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.520]   I don't know, man, but--
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.480]   - I've never heard anyone talk shit about Colorado,
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.320]   I have to say.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.480]   It's kind of refreshing, 'cause it provides
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.440]   a necessary balance for the Colorado Wikipedia page.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.600]   - Yeah, oh, Oregon too, I got problems with Oregon.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.560]   - Oregon. - Yeah.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.440]   Well, here's the issue.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.960]   You have, and I don't like just calling people racist,
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.660]   'cause it's kind of like a two-dimensional insult,
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.160]   but you have the most racist state,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.840]   but the most psychotic anarchist city in the middle of it.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.520]   What is going on up there?
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.580]   How did this happen?
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.680]   The yin and the yang is so extreme
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.160]   that there must be something in the willamette.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.000]   - What do you have against anarchism?
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.840]   - I have nothing, I used to be an anarchist.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.720]   When I was in eighth grade, I had this friend named Mads
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.760]   who was part of a group called Seattle Solidarity,
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.000]   which is like an Antifa precursor.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.640]   So I grew up going to Black Block protests,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.560]   and I mean, there was a particular shooting,
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.980]   the murder of John Williams,
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.680]   who was a Native American woodcarver in downtown Seattle.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.320]   He got killed by a Seattle police officer named Ian Burke.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.760]   John Williams was carving a pipe from a woodblock
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.960]   with a pocket knife.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.120]   He was deaf in one ear.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.480]   The officer pulls a gun on him and says, "Put it down."
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.800]   He doesn't hear him, he shoots him six seconds later.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.000]   So that police-involved shooting
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.320]   is what instantly turned me into a very critical
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.560]   of law enforcement kind of person when I was super young.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.000]   And so as someone who used to see this guy who got murdered,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.480]   who was a 55-year-old man,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.440]   I used to see him around Pike Place where my mom lived.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.600]   It's a public market in downtown.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.800]   That, to me, put me into the anarchist political sphere,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.020]   just channeling the anger of that experience.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   And the officer got no charges, by the way.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.880]   You can look up the video, it's horrific.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.620]   You know, and it didn't get reported.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.980]   The officer, I'm pretty sure, is still active duty.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.260]   And so it's like, situations like that early in life
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.100]   channeled me toward political extremism,
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.580]   but I grew up to realize how incompatible
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:07.920]   that anarchistic worldview is with reality
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.820]   and with American society.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.440]   Can only exist in a small little chamber.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.920]   You know, you can't apply that
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.600]   to the industrial heartland of the country.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.480]   - And I think also anarchism,
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.680]   so I've gotten to know Michael Malice,
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.120]   who's written quite a bit about anarchism.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.240]   And it also exists as a body of literature
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.100]   about different philosophical notions
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.960]   that kind of resist the state,
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.040]   the ever-expanding state in different kinds of ways.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.560]   And it's always nice to have extreme thought experiments
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.100]   to understand what kind of society we want to build,
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.680]   but implementing it may not necessarily be a good idea.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.400]   - Yeah, I mean, Emma Goldman, I'm a huge fan of her writing.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.780]   Also the prison abolitionists that are associated
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.040]   with the anarchist movement, Angela Davis,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.720]   Ruth Wilson Gilmore, all that stuff, influential.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.120]   I still adhere to a lot of those principles
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.640]   when talking about stuff like radical prison reform
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.000]   and stuff like that.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.520]   But just, I drifted more toward having a more open mind
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.920]   as I got older.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.980]   - Extremism implemented in almost all of its forms
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.300]   is probably going to cause a lot of suffering.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.220]   - Yeah.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.120]   - You worked as a doorman on the,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.060]   I could say legendary Bourbon Street in New Orleans.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.540]   - That's right.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.420]   - Where you saw what you described as,
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.700]   this might be another Wikipedia quote, by the way.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.540]   This is where I do my research, it's Wikipedia.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.100]   - Does it say hellish scenes?
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.420]   - Hellish scenes in quotes.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.940]   - Wikipedia is damn right about that.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.140]   - All right, thank you.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.320]   That's a win, that's one in the win column.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.100]   So yeah, tell the story of that.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.500]   What's it like to work on Bourbon Street?
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.340]   What kind of stuff did you see?
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.020]   - I mean, I was a host at a fine dining restaurant
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.780]   on the corner of Bourbon and Iberville.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.220]   So that's the first street if you go from Canal Street
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.060]   onto the corridor.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.140]   So this is across from a daiquiri spot.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.100]   It's the middle of the tourist corridor of New Orleans.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.420]   And the spot was kind of like, kind of a tourist trap.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.640]   It was called Bourbon House.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.740]   The food was good.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.180]   Chef Eric, I don't want you to see this and think,
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.780]   you don't make good andouille sausages,
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.040]   but it was overpriced.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.420]   And so we had to maintain this fine dining facade
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.700]   on a street where almost everyone is throwing up,
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.860]   fighting, or is half naked.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.900]   So there was this policy.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.140]   We had these giant glass windows next to the tables.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.380]   So if you're eating at a Bourbon House,
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.820]   you can look out onto Bourbon Street
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.500]   and you can see as you're dining,
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.700]   a full panoramic view of all these partiers
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.460]   throwing beads, boobs, all that.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.420]   We had this policy where if we're serving someone,
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.340]   we can't look onto Bourbon Street
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.780]   if something crazy is happening.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.620]   So if there's a fight or something like that,
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.900]   we can't look, right?
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.580]   So there is a dude, I remember, I'm fucking serving a table.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.160]   There's a dude in a Batman mask, butt naked,
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.940]   with 12 pairs of beads, just jerking it.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.220]   Back to jerking it.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.500]   He's jerking it, right?
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.680]   And every single person at the restaurant's looking out there
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.260]   like, look, they're taking pictures.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.620]   And the manager, Steven, looks at me,
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.660]   he's like, "Keep your fucking eyes on the table."
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.500]   So I'm serving these people and I'm like,
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.340]   "You want to eat, you like red beans and rice?
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.860]   "Or would you like some Creole fucking da-da-da?"
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.060]   And there's just this dude and ultimately the manager
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.260]   went out and escorted him further down Bourbon Street.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.060]   But I would get off work at around midnight every night
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.620]   and that was when Bourbon Street is at its most chaotic.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.020]   And so I lived in the French Quarter as well.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.460]   So I lived about 12 blocks down Bourbon
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.300]   in a small Creole cottage in a cute little like orange,
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.500]   old school New Orleans, one story spot.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.780]   I lived in the attic above these gay meth dealers
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.860]   named Frankie and Johnny.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.700]   Oh, wow.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.860]   And so I would get off work
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.600]   and I would basically have to walk through
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.700]   like this battlefield.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.200]   I mean, it was a battlefield.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.220]   Getting home was out of like the "Warriors" movie.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.060]   It was almost impossible.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.700]   The best of humanity on display.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.840]   Yeah, it was like Kensington, Philadelphia,
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.020]   but just alcohol.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.740]   Just all alcohol.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.860]   But it's a lot of, well, a lot of visitors, right?
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:58.700]   From outside.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.780]   Almost all visitors.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.220]   And that kind of would set the flow for the weekend.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.540]   For example, if the Raiders were playing the Saints,
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.720]   Raider Nation, and they do not play around.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.060]   If it's the Patriots, that's a whole different crowd.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.580]   They think they're better than everybody else.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.140]   Yeah, well, they technically are better
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.380]   than everybody else, but yeah.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.340]   But people from Massachusetts aren't like
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.060]   the cream of the crop in terms of like American superiority.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.300]   Strong words, yeah.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.660]   No offense, but I mean.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.460]   No, I'm sure they won't take that as an offense.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.100]   They are good at fighting though, I'll tell you that.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.020]   All right, great.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.500]   New England has hands compared to some places.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.220]   Which places are those, Colorado?
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.740]   Colorado has no hands.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.860]   (laughing)
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.020]   The West Coast, not too much hands.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.500]   That's why you feel safe talking shit about Colorado.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.140]   But if you get to the corn-fed parts of East Colorado,
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.180]   I mean, these guys got hands bigger than my head.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.060]   Don't beat the shit out of me.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.860]   But anyways, I'd walk back to my house on Bourbon Street,
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.940]   and I would be sifting through this battlefield,
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.220]   and I had a friend at the time who was like,
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.060]   "Yo, we should do a taxicab confessions type spinoff
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.780]   where we ask people to confess a deep dark secret."
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.340]   And we posted the next day.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.740]   And so, we tried that,
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.220]   and it went viral on Instagram instantly.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.180]   It was mostly incest stories.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.780]   You know, people admitting to incest.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.060]   I know it's a common Southern stereotype,
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.060]   but there's some truth to it.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.180]   There was some murder confessions.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.900]   That was pretty crazy.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.780]   We never really posted any of those, but.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.500]   How'd you get people to confess?
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.340]   Pretty easy.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.220]   And New Orleans has a homicide solve rate of like 22%.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:28.220]   So, I mean, most of the time, they'll just tell you.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.340]   I remember I was walking down Bourbon,
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.580]   and I asked this kid, I was like,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:32.820]   "What's your deepest darkest secret?"
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:33.700]   And he told me, he's like,
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.660]   "I just smoked a dude in the Magnolia,"
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.900]   it's a project housed in the Third Ward,
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.460]   project development, and they said,
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.420]   "I just smoked a dude in the Magnolia Playground
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.500]   for touching my sister, molesting his sister."
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.740]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:45.940]   And he's like, "Yeah, look it up."
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.580]   And I was like, "All right, hold on."
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.460]   And it was like, "Man found dead in Central City Playground,
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.700]   like appeared to be homeless, shot execution style."
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.020]   So, I told the kid, I was like,
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.140]   "Why'd you tell me that?"
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.540]   He's like, "Man, put that shit out there,
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.500]   like I'm trying to go viral, like tag me too."
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.780]   I was like, "Dude, I don't think you understand
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.700]   that even if you're a juvenile," he was probably 15,
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.580]   "You can get juvenile life in Louisiana for a homicide,
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.980]   even if it's, you know, justified."
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.540]   So, I just deleted the footage in front of him.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.180]   I was like, "I'm gonna delete this footage.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.340]   See that trash button?
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.660]   I'm hitting it right now.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.260]   Don't tell anyone that again."
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.580]   And he was like, "All right, I appreciate it."
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.420]   And he walked off, but it's the little moments like that
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.380]   that I always remember.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.100]   - Anything for the 'gram, I guess.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.660]   - Yeah, after a while though, it became sort of repetitive.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.940]   You know, 'cause there's only so many things
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.740]   that people can confess to that go viral, you know?
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.860]   - Oh, so you were trying to see like what?
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.060]   - Well, I mean, there's the incest one.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.440]   Some people would just say like, "I eat ass."
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.460]   That was like everyone said that.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.380]   Or like, "I cheated on someone."
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.140]   - I've seen a surprising number of people on your channel
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.660]   say, "Mention eating ass."
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.500]   - Yeah.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.020]   (laughing)
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.900]   The way, how seriously you said that
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.620]   will live in my head for the rest of my life.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.460]   - That's good.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.020]   I want to live in your head saying
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   that a lot of people mention eating ass.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.380]   - Yeah, a lot of people do mention that.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.380]   Also, that's kind of where I developed this magnetism
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.340]   for freestyle rapping.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.280]   You know, everywhere I go, people rap.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.860]   Not sure why.
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.420]   I mean, as a former rapper myself in middle school
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.700]   and for the first year of high school,
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.180]   I think that maybe like it takes one to know one.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.660]   But everywhere I go, people start rapping.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.660]   If you and me went outside of this podcast studio
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.740]   and walked around for five minutes, I could find somebody.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.580]   - It's rapping.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.740]   - I can tell who raps or who can rap,
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.900]   who has eight bars in their head that they're ready to go.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.380]   - I think you're also, there's something about you
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.380]   that gives them, creates the safe space
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.740]   to perform their art.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.900]   - Yeah.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.220]   The "Quarter Confessions" series
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.120]   was the first time you saw the suit.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.500]   - That's when the suit came out.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.180]   - Yeah, it was kind of like a Ron Burgundy,
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.980]   Eric Andre-inspired.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.120]   - Where'd you get that suit?
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.140]   - Goodwill.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:54.980]   - Goodwill.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.420]   - Yeah, always.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.260]   - Wow.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.140]   I was playing checkers, you were playing chess.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.980]   Good job.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.080]   - I mean, Goodwill has a surprising amount
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.960]   of identical gray suits for sale.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.980]   - Yeah, I've actually gotten suits
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.700]   at thrift stores before.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.540]   They're great.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.620]   - Yeah, a lot of people donate suits.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.140]   I was going for oversized suits,
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.620]   which are the cheapest ones there, so.
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.460]   - Yeah.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.900]   - It's 12 bucks, 12 to $25 every time for the outfit.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.740]   - If I wanted to look super sophisticated,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.980]   like I'm from another era, I would go to a thrift store.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.820]   - Yeah.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.160]   - 'Cause they're usually like this,
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.060]   there's like the patterns they have.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.060]   It's just like a more sophisticated suit,
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.880]   which is what you kind of picked out.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.240]   It made you look ridiculous, but in the best kind of way.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.300]   - The tough part about "Quarter Confessions" for me
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   is that everybody that was featured, for the most part,
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.380]   would more or less regret being a part of the show.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.220]   - Yeah.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.060]   - And that, over time, just gave me a bad feeling
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.540]   where I was like, you know what?
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.740]   I kind of feel like I am doing an ambush interview,
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.980]   especially 'cause I'm presenting as so agreeable,
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.140]   yet the intention is to make something funny.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:57.980]   - Yeah.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.540]   - And I get that that's what people do in the satire sphere.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.740]   I'm sure Ali G and Bruno and Borat did the same thing.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.300]   And I don't think it's unethical,
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.940]   'cause that's all for the purposes of comedy.
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:08.940]   It is what it is.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.540]   But for me, I wanted to do something different.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.780]   - Yeah, because there's an intimacy to confessing a thing.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.620]   - Right.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.780]   - And then you just don't really realize
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.980]   the implications of that.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.540]   - And the atmosphere at Bourbon Street is like,
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.820]   anything goes, it's a free-spirited place.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.900]   But if you transport that energy digitally
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.780]   to a different place, like Colorado,
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.180]   they might look at it and be like, oh man.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.680]   - Different place and time, like five years later.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.520]   - Right.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.100]   - That same person has a family and stuff like this,
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.700]   and all of a sudden they're talking about eating ass.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.900]   - Right, exactly.
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.020]   Kids have to think about that.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.940]   Or imagine if there's a video of your grandma
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.340]   or grandpa out there when he was a kid
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.740]   talking about eating ass.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.860]   That's a horrible experience.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.980]   To discover that about your respected elder later in life,
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.900]   it's tough.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.140]   - I don't even know where to go with that.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.180]   But literally the opening question was,
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.140]   tell me your deepest, darkest secret?
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:50:59.980]   - Yeah.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.540]   - You just come up to somebody like that?
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.380]   - Yeah.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.500]   - How often do you get a no?
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.540]   How often, what's the yes to no ratio?
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.500]   - Well, the weird thing is,
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.940]   we don't really extract answers from people.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.300]   What makes a good interview is when they're ready to talk.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.580]   The more you have to talk
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.940]   and try to get an answer out of them,
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.840]   it's just not a good vibe.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.060]   So we kind of look for people
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.420]   who appear to be already ready to talk.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.820]   Open body language, they seem confident and verbose,
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.120]   and we approach them first.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.220]   - There's a look.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.820]   - We wouldn't approach a shy person and be like,
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.820]   come on, tell me.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.660]   No.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.480]   - What about a person with pain in their eyes?
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.020]   - Oh yeah, we're interviewing them.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.300]   - Yeah, so they're ready to talk,
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.060]   they're just not like...
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.900]   - Yeah.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.020]   - There's different ways to be ready.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.420]   - Right.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.720]   - I see homeless people a lot
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.300]   and they always look fascinating.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.500]   And the ones I've talked to are always fascinating.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.620]   - Yeah, we just did a video in the Vegas tunnels,
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.780]   like trying to, obviously it got taken down by Fox,
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.880]   but whatever.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.780]   - I was gonna make a joke that I didn't see it.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.180]   (laughing)
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:00.820]   - We tried to help a lot of them by getting them IDs.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.620]   And when I made the documentary,
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.800]   I had this idea that if I,
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.700]   it's a big roadblock for them is getting identification.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.860]   Without IDs, you can't check into a homeless shelter,
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.400]   you can't do day labor,
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.920]   you can't qualify for housing, nothing.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.260]   So when we interviewed them,
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.540]   they'd basically tell us if I had my ID,
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.940]   I wouldn't be here.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.460]   And so we said, okay, we're gonna really help this time.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.420]   We're not just gonna talk to them about their struggles,
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.540]   we're gonna actively go out and get them IDs to the DMV.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:31.160]   So we did that and nothing really changed in their life.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.060]   And we sat down with a recovery specialist
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.120]   who works directly with them day in and day out.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:36.960]   And he explained to me
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.880]   that he's been trying to do the same thing
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.260]   I tried to do in a one week period for the past 10 years.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.720]   And that they have deeper underlying traumas and pain
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.840]   that need to be dealt with
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.080]   far before they even take the steps to enter society
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.640]   as a housed person.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.480]   (exhaling)
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.200]   - That's a heavy truth right there.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.240]   - Breaking that shame cycle has to come first
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.360]   because you gotta think, right?
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.240]   Like I'm from a generation that romanticizes vagrancy
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.800]   and homelessness to a certain extent,
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.280]   if it's called van life,
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.200]   or if it is done in a way that's sort of like Rolling Stone,
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.560]   Willie Nelson hit the road.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.040]   People who are above 50,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.320]   they feel really embarrassed
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.160]   to be in the spiral of homelessness.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.140]   They feel like failures.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.240]   A lot of them have kids who they weren't there for.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.560]   That's not the kind of pain that can be dealt with
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.760]   by giving someone a tiny home.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.360]   It's a good step forward,
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.920]   but for someone to really make a change,
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.640]   they have to want to change.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.360]   And so it's how do you help someone
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.160]   and guide themselves in the right direction?
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.500]   And if you're too paternalistic
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.680]   and you use shame as a method to get them to clean up,
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.440]   they're gonna end up right where they started.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.280]   - Yeah.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.120]   - That's a tough truth to accept
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.480]   'cause a lot of people want a quick fix to things.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.240]   And I don't blame people who go out
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.440]   and give bologna sandwiches out to the homeless.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.040]   - And each case is probably its own little puzzle.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.600]   Each person is so complex.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.120]   Now, imagine drug abuse, what that does to the brain.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:01.960]   - Yeah.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.160]   - Trauma, childhood trauma.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.900]   There's so much to unpack.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.460]   And then just the belief that they're the undesirables,
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.040]   that they don't deserve to be a part of society
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.120]   because they failed a fundamental obligation
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.840]   like taking care of their kids.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.720]   - If we could take a small tangent to,
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:20.360]   you mentioned this Vegas video, which is fascinating.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.040]   It was taken down recently by YouTube
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.280]   or YouTube took it down based on--
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.440]   - Yeah, it was illegal.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.280]   - Fox 5, I guess.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.920]   - So the documentary was an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.960]   We used 10 seconds of a news clip
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.360]   that was publicly broadcast by Fox 5 Vegas.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   And according to the Copyright Act of 1976,
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.120]   you're allowed to use any publicly broadcast news clip
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.600]   in a transformative capacity in any documentary film
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.160]   or research paper or broadcast or anything.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.360]   They, specifically this corporation called Gray Media
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.940]   that controls the TV stations in almost every small town,
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.640]   they had lawyers hit up YouTube
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.880]   and YouTube complied with an illegal copyright strike
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.200]   to get our video immediately removed.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.120]   And I'm a YouTube partner,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.520]   I'm in the YouTube partner program.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.480]   So to think that I wasn't forewarned is,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.200]   it's a bit strange,
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.360]   but it also smells like corruption to me
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.280]   to a certain extent.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.880]   - Yeah, you shouldn't have that amount of power.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.040]   At the very least, they should have the power
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.920]   to just like silence that five second clip maybe.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.640]   - Yeah, but I'm taking them to court
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.760]   because I have the means to be able to do so.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.760]   I'm a larger creator, I have an audience,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.880]   I have the financial backing to do it.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.520]   I can't imagine how many people out there
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.040]   are smaller creators with like not as much consumer
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.200]   of a fan base they can mobilize
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   against someone like Fox 5 or the money to go to court.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.120]   So I want to take them all the way there
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.200]   to set precedent for future cases
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.040]   so that these giant mainstream media conglomerates
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.720]   can't copyright strike documentary filmmakers at will.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.640]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.720]   - Oh, thank you for doing that.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.240]   That's really, really, really important
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.320]   and that's really powerful.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.480]   And it might hopefully empower YouTube
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.320]   to also put pressure on people to not,
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.600]   and YouTube is in a difficult position
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.200]   because there's so much content out there.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.120]   There's so many claims, it's hard to investigate,
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.720]   but YouTube should be in a place
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.280]   where they push back against this kind of stuff
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.680]   as a first line of defense,
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.720]   especially to protect small creators.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.280]   So what you're doing is really, really important.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.120]   - Appreciate it, man.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.960]   - And it sucks that it was taken down.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.080]   Do you have any hope?
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.240]   - Well, I talked to my YouTube partner today
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.440]   and he said that the Fox 5 lawyers have two weeks
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.240]   to comply with my counter appeal.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.440]   But you know, I spent 20 grand on human voiceovers
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.640]   in five different languages.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.400]   I invested probably in total like 70K into this video.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.120]   So even if it gets reinstated,
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.320]   the steam's gonna have been taken out of its trajectory.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.360]   - But also it's just like a really important video
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.320]   that's good for the world.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.120]   - Yeah, like why the hell would Fox 5
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:57.200]   have a vested interest in having the video taken down?
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.880]   - I just hate it when people do that to videos
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.760]   or to creators that are doing good in the world.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.560]   - Yeah, it's not an expose on the mayor of Las Vegas.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.480]   It's an attempt to show the civilian public
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.360]   how to get involved in a local nonprofit
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.440]   and potentially intervene in the lives of the tunnel people.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   - Well, fuck Fox 5, the other Channel 5, as you said.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.680]   - Yeah.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   - Well, thank you for pushing back and highlighting it.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.000]   Hopefully it gets brought back up.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.480]   But yeah, defending other creators
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.240]   so that other creators can take risks
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.760]   and don't get taken down for stupid reasons.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.600]   - Yeah.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.560]   - So "Court of Confessions" was written?
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:34.940]   - No, it was all real life, reality TV documentary.
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.680]   But it caught the attention of a larger company
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.320]   called Doing Things Media.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.160]   - Yes.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.240]   - And they contacted me pretty much like a week
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.680]   after I graduated from college in the May of 2019.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.400]   And they said, "Hey, how would you like to produce a show?"
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.280]   I was like, "What do you mean?"
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.000]   They were like, "We'll get you an RV.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.900]   "We'll pay you 45K a year.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.800]   "We'll pay for gas, for food, for two hotels a week.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.380]   "Go out there, make content,
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.480]   "and we'll be in the background just powering it all."
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.440]   - And that was the birth of All Gas No Breaks.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.320]   - Yes.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.400]   I mean, All Gas No Breaks was named after a book
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.000]   that I wrote called "All Gas No Breaks,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   "A Hitchhiker's Diary," which chronicled
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.200]   the 70-day journey that we were just talking about.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.600]   - It's a tough book to find, by the way.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.160]   - Oh yeah, there's only a few copies left.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.640]   I'm thinking about doing a reprint
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.780]   at some point down the line,
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.640]   but I sold off the last 100 copies
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.180]   like a month and a half ago.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.000]   - Until then, you guys should go read
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.180]   "On the Road" by Jack Kerouac.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.020]   - Yeah.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:32.840]   - You should read it.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.680]   - I don't know if you've read it before.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.640]   - If you can't get my book, get "On the Road" by Jack Kerouac.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.480]   - It's great.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.320]   - It's the best.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.760]   - When's your birthday, I'll send you.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.600]   - April 23rd.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.440]   - Okay.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.260]   - I'm a Taurus.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.100]   Come and see it.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:42.940]   - Typical Taurus, yeah.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.240]   - Yeah, I'm a typical Taurus man.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.560]   I'm a Scorpio moon, so write that down.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.800]   - What's the time when you were born?
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.640]   - 11.30.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.720]   - 11.30 at night?
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.120]   Or, of course.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.480]   - Yeah, typical.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.600]   This guy knew it.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.680]   That's the real science.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.520]   - Yeah.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.880]   - Anyways, so the idea of All Gas No Breaks as a show
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.120]   was to combine the, I guess, road dog ethos
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.920]   of the All Gas No Breaks book with the presentation
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   and editing style of Quarter Confessions.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.520]   So it was to take Quarter Confessions on the road
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.280]   that was pretty much like a simulated hitchhiking experience
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.000]   but with the editing and punchy effects
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.800]   of Quarter Confessions, which is like,
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.400]   I wear a suit, we do the fast zoom-ins,
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.520]   little effects, stuff like that.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.520]   It was, man, those were the best years.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.780]   It was just so fun.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.960]   I mean, imagine, you're fresh out of college.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.200]   You were just a doorman interviewing people
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:37.480]   about making out with their cousin and stuff,
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.080]   and then, boom, this company that you've never even heard of
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.000]   is willing to buy you an RV and give you 45K a year,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.040]   which to me, at the time, was more money
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.860]   than I could possibly imagine.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:49.360]   So I called my dad.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.040]   I was like, "Dad, I need you to find me an RV,"
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.880]   'cause he's the only guy I know who knows about cars.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.520]   Even he doesn't know much about cars.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.680]   So he's like, "All right, I'm on it."
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.000]   So the RV was 20,000, and the first event
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.640]   that we were called to cover was the Burning Man Festival.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.040]   And that was tough because Burning Man
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.840]   is not too keen on filming.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.520]   It's supposed to be a non-commercialized escape
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.480]   from reality.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.940]   I mean, they have a gift economy set up.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.800]   It's based upon mutual participation and non-exploitation.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.780]   And so the idea of making a Burning Man video
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:24.800]   was tough at first because burners, oftentimes,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.360]   and this is not all of them,
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.320]   but are pretty well off in general.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.840]   A lot of them have tech jobs,
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.760]   are pretty high up in Silicon Valley.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.880]   And Burning Man is where they go to take the edge off
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.040]   and basically become their burner persona.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.760]   On the playa, they become reborn.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.200]   And they take ketamine, and they wear Kaleidoscope glasses
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.040]   and steampunk hats, and they snort MDMA,
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.480]   and they run around the sand.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.240]   Listen to tech. - Do you snort MDMA?
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.080]   That's one.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.240]   I need to go to MDMA. - Yes, you can.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.160]   - I thought it's a pill.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:53.980]   I didn't know.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.100]   - It's better to take it in a pill or water,
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.960]   but you can snort MDMA.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.360]   - I definitely need to take MDMA.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.080]   I'm already full of love, but that,
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.540]   I'd probably go on another level.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.380]   - Yeah, don't snort it
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.920]   'cause it'll only last you 90 minutes.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.000]   - Let me write that down.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.200]   - So anyways, we didn't know what to do
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.320]   because we'd try to film.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320]   - Don't snort.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.360]   - The initial idea for "All Gas, No Brakes"
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   was to, instead of asking people,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.880]   "What's your deepest, darkest secret?"
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.240]   It was, "What's the craziest trip you've been on?"
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.760]   So the idea was to not satirize drunk people,
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.400]   but satirize people who are fried on acid.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.000]   And so we went to Boulder real quick,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.680]   did a test interview with some lady
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.800]   who talked about seeing ancestral aliens
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.360]   during a peyote retreat.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.760]   And so it's pretty easy to extract trip reports
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.800]   from hippies and, you know, gutter punks
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.320]   and stuff like that, or oogles.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.460]   So we go to Burning Man.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.520]   We start asking people, like, you know,
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.920]   "What's your craziest trip story?"
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.320]   And they didn't have the same type
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.640]   of free-flowing storytelling style
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.960]   that, like, an on-the-street crust punk
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.260]   in New Orleans might have, where they're like,
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.000]   "I don't give a fuck, I'll tell you whatever."
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.480]   These people were very bottled up
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.320]   about what they were willing to disclose.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.120]   So we went on Burning Man Radio,
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.560]   and we did a broadcast, and we said,
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.680]   "Hey, we're psychedelic journalists."
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.040]   It was me and my friend CL at the time.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.280]   I said, "We're psychedelic journalists.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.740]   "We're parked on 10 and I,"
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.560]   which is a cross street in Black Rock City.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.660]   And we said, "We have a 1998 Catalina Coachman Sport.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.940]   "It's an RV.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.380]   "We've set up a podcast studio.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.720]   "We're doing a show about psychedelic voyages."
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.560]   - Yeah.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.640]   - So lo and behold, two hours later,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.840]   we had 10 people lined up at the RV.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.680]   - Nice.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.500]   - Willing to talk.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.040]   So that vetted people in advance for us.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.160]   And so we did a couple interviews, and that was that.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.600]   - Well, what were some of the stories
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.280]   from the trip reports?
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.760]   - There was this lady named Razma
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.480]   who said that she was known in several circles
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.880]   in Berkeley for being multi-orgasmic
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.680]   and could create multiple repeated climaxes
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.800]   using only her mind by squinting her eyes
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.520]   and squeezing her eyes together so much
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.640]   that the pleasure spiral just went crazy.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.760]   - I feel like I talked to several people
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.880]   like that at Berkeley.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.920]   - Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.520]   - Not that, well, yeah, that lady.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.360]   I think she did.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.240]   She manifests herself in many forms, yeah.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.560]   - Right, but still, it was on the cruder end.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.320]   There was one guy named Kimbo Slice was his burner name.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.240]   He talked about taking a shit
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.420]   after taking a quarter of mushrooms
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.160]   and how he was like seeing his childhood
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.320]   and visualizing his past life, you know,
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.600]   as the turds were flowing into the toilet
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.000]   and just talks about the psychedelic union
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.360]   between pooing and taking shrimps.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.320]   - So he was very visual with his words.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.600]   - Yeah, so there was stuff like that.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.680]   I interviewed Alex Gray, which was super cool,
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   about his first trip in San Francisco
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.280]   when he was in 1971, shortly after the Summer of Love.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.000]   I got to do some pretty cool interviews,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.600]   but still it was a semi-ambush style.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.000]   I wouldn't say that we were doing journalism yet.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.880]   It was still comedic video work, you know?
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.660]   - Was there a narrative that tied it together?
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.780]   It's like really just a trip, comedic almost with the--
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.900]   - Interview, and then I go, "Burning man,"
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.140]   and then it's on to the next one.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.080]   So I guess that could give a loose structure,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.480]   but it's just like a punchy and slapstick thing.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.520]   Everything was going good
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.720]   until we interviewed this guy named DJ Softbaby.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.320]   He was wearing a golden leotard
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.840]   with, once again, kaleidoscope glasses,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   shirtless, dancing, you know, dancing.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.040]   He was eating chowder out of a plastic bowl,
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.820]   and he was like, "This chowder's so fucking good.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.400]   "This is the best chowder I've ever had in my life."
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.360]   And he starts putting the chowder on his face,
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.560]   and he's like, "I want the chowder all over me, yeah!"
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.800]   And so we just go, "Hey man,
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.240]   "can you just do a dance for us real quick,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.960]   "just for some B-roll?"
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.920]   He does a dance.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.280]   We post it on Instagram the next morning.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   Doing Things Media's CEO calls me, "Reed,"
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.120]   he says, "All of our pages are down."
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.520]   And he's like, "That guy you filmed dancing last night
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.080]   "on drugs, putting chowder on his face,
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.520]   "that guy's at the top of MIT."
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.640]   - Top of MIT.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.480]   I don't understand what that means.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.840]   - He went to MIT. - That's like saying,
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.760]   you know, "My brother's a rocket scientist,"
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.720]   and he's like, "Head of NASA," or whatever.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.840]   - Well, I mean, the guy knows people in Boston.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.680]   - Okay.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.960]   - You know, not in the whitey-bulger sense,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.840]   but in the reverse sense.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.280]   - I have trouble believing that DJ Softbaby--
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.040]   - Oh, DJ Softbaby was major.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.080]   It could have been Harvard, it could have been,
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.560]   but it wasn't UMass.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.760]   - I don't think there's anybody that's, quote,
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.640]   at the head of MIT who's putting,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.480]   what was it, all over his face?
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.640]   - Chowder. - Chowder.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.280]   - Well, then you haven't been to Burning Man yet.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.400]   - Okay, I've not been to Burning Man.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.920]   I'm gonna have to consult my colleagues at MIT
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.440]   if they know DJ Softbaby.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.600]   - So whoever he-- - It probably was Harvard.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.560]   Let's put it on them.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.720]   - Okay, the top of Harvard.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.680]   So he made some calls, you know, to the tops,
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.240]   to the heads of big tech,
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.680]   got all the "Doing Things" media pages taken down.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.560]   At the time, that was like vast network of pages.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.360]   And we ended up having to take,
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   obviously the video came down,
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.320]   and he held the entire network of Instagram pages hostage.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.560]   And so that was, he made us agree
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.040]   to never post that video again,
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.400]   and then somehow got all of our pages reinstated.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.320]   So that was my first brush with powerful people on drugs,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.600]   and that was probably my last brush
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.960]   with powerful people on drugs.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.280]   - So what did you transition into from there?
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.920]   - I think after Burning Man, we went to the South,
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.640]   went to Talladega Race Weekend,
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.040]   went to a Donald Trump Jr. book signing,
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.360]   went to a Juggalo-adjacent fetish mansion
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.640]   in central Florida called the Sausage Castle.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.480]   - A Juggalo-adjacent sausage, okay,
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.440]   can you run that by me again?
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.640]   - A Juggalo-adjacent fetish mansion in central Florida.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.300]   - Fetish mansion in central Florida, Juggalo-adjacent.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.760]   I mean, every single one of those words,
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.520]   I feel like needs a book or something.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.560]   - Right.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.080]   - So Juggalo, by the way, who are the Juggalos?
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.840]   Is this ICP? - Just ICP fans.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.680]   - ICP fans, okay.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.320]   - But I say adjacent because it's not a Juggalo mansion,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.160]   but there's a lot of Juggalos who kick it at the mansion,
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.760]   and it's Juggalo-friendly.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.360]   - Oh, okay, Juggalo-friendly.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.760]   - Yeah, 'cause they get made fun of in a lot of places.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.160]   - Oh, so it's not, okay, got it.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.000]   - And Juggalos say outrageous shit,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.240]   you know, and they embarrass themselves,
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.960]   and they fight a lot, so they're on the FBI's gang list,
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.280]   which, if you ask me-
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.600]   - ICP or the- - The Juggalos.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.000]   - The Juggalos, who is the head of the Juggalos?
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.280]   - It would be Violent J and Shaggy Too Dope.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.560]   But there's associated acts, like Twizdid,
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.680]   and there's a whole rabbit hole.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.840]   Honestly, Tech N9ne is sort of a part of that.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.200]   - Tech N9ne, I don't know who that is.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.240]   Should I know who that is?
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.280]   - He's actually one of the top-selling touring rappers,
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.440]   despite having sort of not that many streams.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   Tech N9ne is like, he's got a huge cult following in Missouri.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:47.240]   This is like, the Juggalos started in Warren, Michigan.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.000]   - We should also say ICP, Insane Clown Posse.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.640]   So this is a thing, this is a movement.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.680]   - Oh yeah, if you went to Seattle right now
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.960]   and punched a cop, and they booked you in county jail,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.800]   you may end up running with the Juggalos.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.760]   - Running with the Juggalos.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.640]   - They are of presence in Pacific Northwest prison system,
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.520]   from what I've heard.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.440]   - Can you tell a Juggalo from like a distance?
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.880]   - Well, they say, "Whoop, whoop."
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.880]   So if you see a Juggalo, they'll say that.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.720]   Also like--
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.600]   - I'll try to, I'll try to look out for that.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   - They're kind of, it's called the Dark Carnivals,
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.200]   the mythology they abide by.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.640]   - What do they define themselves?
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.480]   What's the ideology of a Juggalo?
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.720]   - A family, a family.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.360]   - No, I understand, but what's the ideology?
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.360]   What's like the philosophical foundation of the--
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.200]   - They're anti-racist.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.760]   They like to drink Faygo,
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.800]   and also just like cheap liquor and stuff like that.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.840]   They're into drugs.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.680]   - Yeah.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.200]   - A lot of circles, if you pull out a crack pipe,
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.040]   people will be like,
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.440]   "I don't wanna drink with you anymore."
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.640]   If you're at a Juggalo party
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.240]   and someone's smoking Twiz or something,
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.960]   it's relatively accepted.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.800]   - And what's Twiz?
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.640]   - Meth.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.920]   - Meth, right, right.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.200]   Lots of tattoos?
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.040]   - Yeah.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.560]   The Hatchet Man is the most common one.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.560]   So it's a psychopathic records logo.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.480]   It's a cartoon of a clown wheeling a hatchet.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.840]   It's actually a pretty sick logo.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.560]   - I vaguely remember enjoying some of the ICP music.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.400]   - It's good.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.240]   - Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.060]   It's funny.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:11.900]   It's edgy.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.200]   - Well, they get satirized a lot,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.840]   but I got love for the clowns.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.760]   And also, so when All Gas No Brakes transitioned away
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.000]   from rich elite drug parties and into like the South,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.440]   that's when the fun really started to happen.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.600]   Living in your RV in Alabama and Florida
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.680]   and stuff is the best.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]   - Why?
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.520]   What is it about Alabama?
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.560]   - People are just so friendly down there,
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.160]   and it's warm year round,
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.360]   and people are non-judgmental.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.200]   It's just great.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.160]   The South gets hated on a lot,
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.440]   especially in the coastal states.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.620]   Mississippi and Alabama are kind of like the butts
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.800]   of a lot of jokes and stuff,
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.240]   but those are great states.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.060]   - No, I love it.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.700]   New Mexico, Albuquerque, all those.
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.560]   - Oh yeah, the ABQs, it's great.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.600]   - ABQ, what's that?
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.440]   - Albuquerque.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.160]   It's what Jesse Pinkman called it, is the ABQ.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.280]   - Oh, shit.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.960]   The depth of references you bring to the table is intense.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.800]   - It's okay.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.720]   - I met a lady in Albuquerque
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.320]   when I was traveling across the United States,
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.880]   and she said, "Take me with you."
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.120]   Said, "I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't."
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.120]   But I didn't think about that lady.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.640]   - Think you made the right call.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.080]   - I don't know.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.900]   On the Road, by Jack Kerouac.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.800]   - Best book I've ever read in my life.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.340]   - There's a moment when he meets a nice girl on a bus,
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.800]   and they have a love affair.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.640]   It was good.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.720]   - On the bus, or they?
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.880]   - No, no, they went to California.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.760]   Well, yeah, and there was a love affair on the bus,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.600]   but it wasn't sexual.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.240]   It was just romantic.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.320]   - It was in the air.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.200]   - It was in the air,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.560]   which there is something in the air on a bus,
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.160]   like a Greyhound, Megabus, that type of situation.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.000]   There's something.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.280]   - Certainly something in the air.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.120]   - There's a romance.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.120]   There is, man, when you travel across.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.100]   'Cause it's like strangers getting together,
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.720]   and you're feeling each other out.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.120]   But you're in it, you each have a story,
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.920]   'cause you wouldn't be taking a bus unless you had a story.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.800]   Especially if you're traveling cross-country,
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.640]   there's something.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.440]   - You ever taken the dollar bus from Philly to New York,
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.280]   the Chinatown bus?
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.280]   - Yeah, I have, yeah.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.240]   - That's a great bus.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.080]   The people on that.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.400]   - It's not a fucking dollar, though.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.000]   - It was, there's some that are five bucks.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.280]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.060]   If you book it way ahead of time.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.480]   It's like $20.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.840]   I was like, this is a fucking lie, calling it $1.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.660]   - I got on the show.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.500]   - I don't know why I'm swearing.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.800]   The anger came out, I apologize.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.960]   - Hey, swearing's okay sometimes.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.760]   When I got on, last time I was on the Chinatown bus,
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.000]   there was like a rooster walking down the aisle.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:23.840]   - Actual rooster?
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.280]   - Yep, chilling, it was awesome.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.640]   - Well, there's a nice part of your film with the rooster.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.920]   I forgot about that.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.520]   - Yeah, that felt almost fake.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.360]   - Yeah.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.180]   - Did you plant the rooster?
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.160]   - No, the rooster, there's a place in Ybor City,
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.200]   in Tampa, where roosters walk around all the time,
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.120]   and we had a rooster parked there,
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.200]   right by the main drag for,
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.160]   what did I say, we had a rooster parked?
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.720]   We had the RV parked in Ybor City for a long time,
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.460]   and the rooster laid eggs in the undercarriage.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.300]   - Nice.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.360]   - Back to the All Gas No Brakes thing, though.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.200]   - So it was lots, it was really fun making it,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.880]   and then we started All Gas No Brakes in September of 2019.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.160]   Six months later, the country shuts down,
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.560]   and everything just hits the fan.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.680]   I was actually here in Austin when it shut down.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.080]   I was on 6th Street, I remember the,
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.800]   I don't just hang out on 6th Street all the time,
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.640]   but I was just here.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.800]   - Yeah, you do, come on, let's be honest.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.400]   - I do like 6th Street.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.200]   I like East Austin better, but I like 6th Street too.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.960]   So anyways, the NBA shuts down, everything's shutting down,
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.320]   so I went down to the Dirty 6 and I asked this doorman,
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.920]   I was like, "Are you guys ever gonna shut down?"
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.160]   He was like, "Fuck no, bro, the Dirty 6 never closes."
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.400]   And I was like, "All right, we'll see about that.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   "Next day, plywood."
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.640]   And then I was like, "All right."
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.960]   I thought my career was over when COVID hit.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.300]   I was like, "What are we gonna do?
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.200]   "Nothing's happening anymore, there's no more parties
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.720]   "or Talladega races or Burning Man's to go to."
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.280]   So I went back to Seattle in the RV
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.200]   and I just spent four months just depressed,
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.600]   living in the RV, trying to figure out what would happen.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.000]   - But all gas, no breaks, went on still.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.440]   - This was the craziest thing about that period of time
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.760]   is that when COVID hit, I'm sure you remember,
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.360]   everything turned political overnight.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.880]   In Seattle, if you went to a house party,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.380]   you can get canceled because people were like,
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.920]   "Oh, you're a super spreader."
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.960]   So if you wanted to socialize,
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.260]   even with a group of four or more,
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:19.640]   you had to do so with your phones damn near turned off.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.960]   And a lot of people were doing
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.400]   hyper-social policing at that time.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.200]   Beyond that, in the South and in more conservative places,
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.920]   they were doing the opposite.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   They were trying to prove that they could hang out
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.280]   500 deep with no mask
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.760]   to make a statement against the establishment.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.960]   So you had this polarization that led to more division.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.560]   And that's when the anti-vax protest started.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.900]   And I went to Sacramento and the passion was unreal.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.680]   This is about two months after the COVID lockdowns began.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.200]   And that was my first political video was at the Sacramento,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.260]   the California State Capitol in Sacramento,
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.720]   documenting the, they called it the Freedom Rally,
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.420]   but that's typically like anti-vax stuff.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.560]   And it was real intensity.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   And that video was my most successful to date at that time.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.680]   And so I was like, "Okay, am I a political reporter now?
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.880]   "Am I covering politics?
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.520]   "Like, what's going on?"
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.500]   - What were the interviews that made up that video?
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.320]   What kind of, what style of questions were you asking?
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.560]   - I don't know if you remember,
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.320]   but I was actually scared when the pandemic started.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.360]   I thought that this is something that might kill us all
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.320]   based upon what I was consuming.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.920]   And so I'd ask people,
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.640]   "What do you think about this lockdown?"
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.620]   And I've had people say, "I'm immune compromised.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:40.600]   "If I get exposed to COVID, I have a 95% fatality rate.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.580]   "But guess what?
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.540]   "I'd rather be free and dead than alive, living in fear."
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.300]   And I was like, "Wow."
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.780]   So it was just stuff along those lines.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.540]   You had some San Diego surfers there
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.980]   complaining about the beaches being shut down
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.840]   when such awesome waves were coming.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.020]   - Yeah, it's interesting how that really brought out
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:02.160]   the worst in people.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.100]   - Oh yeah.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.540]   - I'm not sure why that is.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.440]   Fear maybe, paranoia.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.780]   I don't know, it really divided people.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.340]   Like along the lines, as you mentioned,
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.740]   like triple mask yourself or fight for your country.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.580]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.080]   Why are those the two options?
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.460]   That is literally what it was.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.140]   - Yeah, it's wild.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.700]   - And both groups think they're fighting
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.300]   for the survival of something.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.400]   And so that's where you really run into problems
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.140]   when you have two polarized groups
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.180]   who both think that their cause is for the common good.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.140]   Mutual understanding is impossible at that juncture.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:43.140]   And so after three months of almost everybody
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:46.800]   being locked down, George Floyd happens.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.060]   And I remember I saw the third precinct burning
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.500]   on my phone in Minneapolis.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:00.100]   And everyone says, "Andrew, you have to go cover this."
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.380]   And I'm somebody, like I said,
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.540]   police violence has been close to my heart
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.000]   since I was a kid.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.520]   And my first thought is, I can't do that.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.900]   I'm a comedic reporter.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.420]   I can't go to Minneapolis and cover this.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.740]   It'll be the end of my career.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:20.340]   And I had a friend named Lacey who I went to college with.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:21.340]   And she told me, she was like,
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.420]   "Bro, this is your chance for you to do something serious.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.660]   "You can actually create a meaningful piece of reporting
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.060]   "like you always wanted to before quarter confessions.
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.780]   "And you can turn All Gas No Brakes into a news source."
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   So I called Reed, who is the CEO of the company
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.660]   that owned All Gas No Brakes.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.660]   And I was like, "Look, man, I wanna go to Minneapolis."
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:40.740]   I was in Orlando at the time.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.780]   I was actually at the Sausage Castle.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.620]   And he said--
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.540]   - Sorry, the Sausage Castle?
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.060]   - Yeah, the Juggalo Mansion.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.820]   - Oh, right, that's called the Sausage Castle.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.940]   - So I'm watching Minneapolis unfold
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:55.220]   on Lake Street where it was burning.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.360]   And I got to the Orlando airport
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.020]   and I booked a flight without,
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.180]   I booked it on my own card.
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.220]   I didn't consult my boss or anything.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:06.860]   And I was sitting in my seat on the flight.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.780]   And he straight up told me, he's like,
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.640]   "If you fuck this up and this destroys the brand,
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.420]   "we're getting a different host.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   "This, if you mess this up and you turn our show
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.240]   "away from a party show about drinking and drugs
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.240]   "and all that stuff, and you make this a social justice show,
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.940]   "you're done."
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.460]   But I was like, I just turned my phone off.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.160]   I got to the Minneapolis airport
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.860]   on the second night of the riots.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.260]   And when I got to the airport,
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.140]   there was National Guardsmen in the airport.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.700]   And it was like a call of duty mission,
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.180]   the one in the airport.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:44.280]   And on the speaker, they say,
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.340]   "If you're arriving here right now,
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.820]   "you are not permitted to go
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.500]   "anywhere outside of the airport.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.180]   "National Guardsmen will escort you
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:52.980]   "to your Uber or to your car.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.720]   "They're gonna take a picture of your ID.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.380]   "They're gonna figure out where you're going.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.060]   "You are not permitted to go outside tonight."
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.040]   And so Lacey picks me up.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.200]   There's two people in the back,
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.300]   two of her homegirls wearing like shiesty masks.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.100]   And I'm like, "What are we doing?
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:06.940]   "Where are we going?"
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.660]   And she goes, "We're gonna go film the riot.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.300]   "We're going to Lake Street."
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.220]   And so we drive down there.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.740]   Kmart is burning.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.580]   Target is burning.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.920]   Everything is on fire.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.780]   She has the Sony A7.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.380]   She gives me a microphone and she's like,
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.900]   "Go talk to that guy."
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.020]   And that was a guy with a Molotov cocktail in his hand
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.500]   who had just burned Kmart down.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.860]   And so I go, "What should I ask him?"
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.420]   She goes, "What's on your mind?"
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.580]   So I walk up to him and I'm like, "What's on your mind?"
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.840]   He said something like,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.660]   "Everything that was happening here was supposed to happen.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:40.980]   "This is how we feel.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.860]   "Is it right?
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:42.700]   "No.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.100]   "Is this gonna benefit the community?
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.900]   "No, but this is how we feel."
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.980]   - This is how we feel.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.460]   That's pretty powerful.
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:53.280]   That's, through a lot of the documenting that you do,
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.220]   this is how we feel is like screaming through that.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.540]   - Yeah, and I noticed that aside
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.060]   from a group called Unicorn Riot,
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.240]   there was no one else actually interviewing the protesters.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.580]   The local news was on the bridge, 15, not 15,
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.940]   but five blocks away,
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.420]   filming just the scene itself, just the fire.
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.100]   But I saw some crazy things off camera too.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.240]   I saw, so there was kind of two groups there.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.900]   There was like the anarchists, more mobilized protesters.
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.680]   And then there was just mostly
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.260]   African-American community members who were just pissed,
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.820]   who had nothing to do with the organized resistance.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.580]   And they were all kind of joining forces to riot.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.580]   And there was this anarchist kid
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.140]   who ran up to White Castle with like a Molotov cocktail.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.820]   And he was about to throw it at White Castle.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:42.540]   And this black dude ran up to him and grabbed his arm.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:45.540]   And he's like, "Nah, we fuck with White Castle."
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.740]   And I was like, "What?"
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.920]   And so you see, if you go on Lake Street,
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.580]   every business is burned.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.380]   White Castle remains.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:56.460]   I also saw all these dudes rip this ATM out of a bank
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.120]   and hit it with sledgehammers.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.180]   They were a group of friends
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.780]   hitting it with sledgehammers, right?
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.460]   They're hitting it with sledgehammers, boom.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.180]   All of a sudden, money starts spraying out of the ATM,
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.580]   like I've never seen some shit like this,
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.780]   like pouring out of it.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.940]   And then these group of friends
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.700]   who were just united in getting it open
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.260]   start fighting each other for the money
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.820]   as it's flying out of it.
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.660]   And so there was just, it was like a,
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:21.900]   like "Joker" from the "Batman's Army" type vibes.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.140]   But I got shot in the ass by the National Guard.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.140]   It was no good.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.500]   - Like a what, a rubber bullet?
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.160]   - Yeah, not shot. - What did that feel like?
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.320]   - Honestly, it hurt.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.520]   - I'm not sure what I was expecting
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.120]   as an answer to that question.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.680]   I liked it, it was good.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.400]   - Yeah, and then after that, I posted the video
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.840]   and it was very well received.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.680]   And that was the pivotal point where I realized
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.400]   that everything was gonna change.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.320]   - I mean, there was still kind of a comedic element
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.080]   to the way you do conversations, to the way you edit.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.480]   So did you see yourself as a,
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.180]   potentially like a Jon Stewart type of character?
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.620]   - At first, but you know, I just think human beings
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:00.740]   are just funny in general.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.180]   - Yeah, the absurdity of it.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.940]   - Cool thing about Jon Stewart is like,
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.700]   I generally like to say that anybody who works
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.380]   for corporate media, whether it be Comedy Central
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.860]   or anything owned by Time Warner, Fox, MSNBC,
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.820]   they can't say what they want.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.100]   Because in order to climb up in those organizations,
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.260]   you have to appease the narrative of the company
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.500]   that you're working for to rise in the ranks.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:25.080]   Jon Stewart, I feel like has so much clout
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.080]   in the media world that I'm pretty sure
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.840]   he can say whatever he wants.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.760]   Like, I actually don't think that Jon Stewart
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.120]   is controlled by anybody.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:32.960]   I really don't.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.240]   I think that he can go on the show and talk about whatever.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.480]   - I do think that certain people have broken the brains of,
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.480]   COVID broke the brains of a lot of really great people
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.400]   I admire.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.360]   Trump broke the brains of a lot of people I admire.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.040]   Like to where Trump derangement syndrome became a thing.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.760]   Like you can't see the world quite as clearly because of it.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   And I think Jon Stewart is quite a genius
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.120]   at like stepping away, even though the world needed him
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.200]   in that time, stepping away during that moment of Trump
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.840]   and coming back now, sort of being able to reflect,
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.760]   being sort of the elder statesman.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.840]   - My favorite Jon Stewart moment that illustrates
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:19.600]   that perfectly is whenever he went on the Colbert Show.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.640]   And he was just joking around with Stephen Colbert,
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.320]   who I think is a full-blown propagandist,
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.400]   about the Wuhan lab leak theory.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.040]   He was just goofing around and he was like,
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.760]   "It's called the coronavirus lab and they had it before.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.160]   "And now what do we have?"
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.960]   And it was like, you could see in Stephen Colbert
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.440]   that he was like gun to his head type shit,
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.380]   where he's like, "Jon, Jon, stop joking about that."
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.680]   And that made me realize like, oh,
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.360]   everything that Jon Stewart did,
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.880]   especially for the 9/11 first responders,
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.520]   he's a true American.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.640]   And not in the sense of like the different political parties
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.400]   want you to believe as an American,
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.920]   not a do your part and social distance American,
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.880]   not a wave your Trump flag
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.440]   in the back of your pickup truck American,
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.320]   just a guy who genuinely stands up for what's right.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:13.480]   - There's a degree to which you can be in those positions
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.600]   easily captured by groupthink, though,
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.760]   even when you're not controlled by bosses and money
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.960]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.160]   I think Jon Stewart has been mostly resistant,
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   but it's hard, his position is difficult.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.560]   - I think he's done the best job, though.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.560]   If someone in that, obviously,
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.040]   Democrat-connected corporate media economy,
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.800]   he seems to be the freest talker.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.840]   - Yeah.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.220]   So this is when you first became famous.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.400]   - I'm not even sure what fame means.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.040]   I mean, I just see myself as me.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.380]   - When did you get the shades?
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.680]   - Oh, that was on tour.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.560]   That was, that's a whole, the shades, that's dark time.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:52.280]   But this, I didn't make--
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.480]   - This is a meme, really?
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.740]   I don't even know if that's a symbol of fame or whatever.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:58.160]   - I didn't make journalism to become famous.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.480]   I made it to give people a platform to share their stories.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.260]   It just so happens that people liked it enough
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.920]   to where I became sort of famous.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.680]   But if I could go back and not be the on-camera guy
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.760]   and just platform the stories, I would.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.280]   But the reality is, people need a face
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.600]   to attach to stuff they like,
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.540]   and so that's just how it is.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:20.320]   But yeah, I would say right around Minneapolis protests,
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.680]   Portland protests, Proud Boys rally time,
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.020]   when I was really in there,
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:25.360]   is when I started to be acclaimed
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.560]   as more than just like a ambush meme lord.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.720]   - Did that have an effect on you, the fame?
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.000]   - Not at that point.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:33.840]   - Not at that point.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.800]   So you were still able to have a lightness to you?
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.320]   - Well, the country was basically closed.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.160]   - Yeah.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.520]   - So it wasn't like there was a street to walk down
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.480]   where people were like, "There's that guy!"
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.480]   So getting famous during COVID made it
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.040]   so when the country reopened,
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.360]   it was as if my life really changed,
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.400]   'cause I was like, "Oh, all these fans I made during COVID
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.880]   "are seeing me out at the bar.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.200]   "This is cool."
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.040]   - Yeah.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.760]   - At first, fame is the best thing ever,
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.960]   because you can go anywhere in the country,
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.600]   and these spaces that you normally feel a bit insecure in,
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.480]   like a local dive bar, a cool restaurant, a coffee shop,
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.780]   where you'd just be another guy,
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.620]   all of a sudden they're like,
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.840]   "Oh my God, I'm a big fan."
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.480]   They give you free stuff.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.760]   You get this sense of acceptance
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.160]   that you never would have gotten before.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.640]   But there's also--
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.840]   - The dark side.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.500]   - Well, it's all love, man.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.120]   Just to speak to the first part you're saying,
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.320]   it's just so much love that people have and they share it.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.160]   - It's amazing.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:27.980]   I'm sure you know what it's like.
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:28.820]   - Yeah, it's beautiful.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.720]   - The only downside of fame, really,
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.200]   is that you can't really be anonymous again,
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.680]   and you have to seek out more strange environments
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.800]   to be anonymous in.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.460]   Like right now, I live in the desert, basically,
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.960]   and I wanna live in the middle of nowhere
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.120]   in the Mojave Desert.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.400]   Not because I'm scared of people,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.320]   but 'cause I just wanna be like curious me again.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.240]   When people don't know and I can ask questions
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.520]   to people that I'm interested in without them going,
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.000]   "I remember, I see you here or I see you there."
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:53.920]   That's the main thing.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.520]   That's what I loved about hitchhiking.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.000]   - Yeah, just to have anonymity.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.240]   - Yeah, it's the best.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.520]   But both are great.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.800]   Complaining about fame is just the lamest shit.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.440]   - Yeah, we should go to furry conventions that you covered.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.600]   Wear an outfit.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.280]   - I love furries, I should do that.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.440]   - Yeah, we should go together.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.280]   I go all the time.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.160]   We should go together.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.000]   - What's your favorite outfit?
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:12.820]   - Have you ever been to a furry convention?
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.280]   - No, I have not.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.640]   - I think you might like it more than you think.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:23.080]   - Listen, maybe I'm just afraid to face who I really am.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.480]   - Yeah, your fursona, the true Lex will come out
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.680]   when you're in a $3,600 lizard suit.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.960]   - Lizard, is that what they go with?
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.720]   - Well, scalies are the lizard furries.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.380]   And there's a big division in the community
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.200]   where they think scalies are kind of douchebag.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.680]   The scalie suits are more expensive.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.960]   They're about seven grand, whereas a fur suit is 3,600.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.880]   So, and they're also taller.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.840]   So when the scalies pull up to the fur fest,
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   it's like, ah, fuck the reptiles.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.680]   - Fuck the reptiles, I can get behind that.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.600]   I'm more like a teddy bear type of guy.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.440]   - Yeah.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.240]   - I think bears, what's, maybe squirrels, I don't know.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.000]   - Ooh, squirrels are so cool.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:00.840]   - Giant squirrels, yeah.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:01.920]   - I wanna put a GoPro on one
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.620]   and just see what the hell they do.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.160]   - You were talking about that conversation
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:10.000]   with the guy at the head of Doing Things Media.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.160]   How did that end up?
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.240]   - Well, I mean, I wanna clear up a few things.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.400]   Reed, the CEO of Doing Things,
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.060]   I actually think he's a good guy.
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.360]   I think that he was just trying to run a business.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.600]   He saw what was working for his brand,
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.400]   which is very college-centric, very festival-centric.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.080]   And he was right to think that journalism,
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.800]   and especially coverage of sensitive topics like COVID
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.440]   or police brutality would definitely not work on merch.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.760]   You know, you're not gonna sell a picture
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.920]   of me interviewing someone at a riot
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.400]   like you would me interviewing a furry
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.720]   or a drunk dude in Alabama.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.160]   It doesn't work the same.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.000]   So it was a lot harder to monetize,
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.540]   not just 'cause of YouTube censorship,
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.160]   but also just because of the sensitive nature of the content.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.160]   So Reed was looking out for himself as a businessman.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.720]   There was a different partner,
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.240]   well, I'm not gonna say his name,
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.040]   that was more connected in Hollywood.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.520]   I think he's responsible for the collapse of the show.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.720]   - What was the collapse like?
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.600]   What happened?
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.360]   - So right as the country's reopening,
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.160]   I get a DM from Eric Wareheim of Tim and Eric.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.360]   And I'm covering something called the UFO Mega Conference
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.520]   in Laughlin, Nevada, which is a beautiful river town.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.360]   And he DMs me, he says, "Let's make a show."
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.720]   And I'm like, "Oh shit, is this real?"
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.080]   You know, I grew up such a big fan
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.360]   of Nathan For You and The Eric Andre Show,
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.680]   and those are produced by their company, absolutely.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.080]   So I was like, "Hell yeah, let's do it."
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.600]   Three days later, I get a call that says,
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.720]   "Jonah Hill wants to hop on board."
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.000]   And I can't believe this, you know,
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.440]   I'm still in the RV and I'm in Laughlin, Nevada.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.080]   So I'm like, "Jonah Hill, super bad,
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.200]   "are you shitting me right now?"
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.760]   So I was excited.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.120]   And, oh, and Moneyball, Jonah Hill's a great actor.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.600]   - Oh, he's great, he's great all around.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.440]   - Yeah.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.440]   - Doesn't get the credit he deserves.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.760]   Well, I mean, he's got the credit by now,
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.200]   but still deserves more.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.720]   - So basically, just within a week,
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.840]   I assembled this super team of Tim and Eric.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.760]   - Super bad team?
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.640]   - Yeah, pretty much, of Tim and Eric.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.480]   - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.240]   - No, that was good, and Jonah Hill.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.640]   And yeah, we just pitched it around.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.600]   Every single TV network rejected it.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.680]   I don't know why.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.160]   And they mainly did that because
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.760]   I was in this weird situation
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.720]   where I had signed a contract with Doing Things Media
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.640]   that I didn't realize was called a 360 deal.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.640]   That's what they use in like the rap world.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.320]   Basically means that I can't do anything outside of them
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.400]   without them getting 100% of the money.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.720]   So if I was to go work at Sbarro or Quiznos
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.960]   while I was working for All Gas, No Brakes,
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.960]   they would get my 500 bucks a week from the sandwich spot.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.200]   I was unable to earn any outside income.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:48.560]   I didn't read the fine print 'cause I was 21.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:52.520]   And like I told you, 45K a year RV, sounds sick.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.640]   And basically, the TV networks were like,
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.800]   why would we buy a show if the digital brand's
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.200]   gonna be running at the same time?
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.320]   'Cause they didn't wanna stop doing All Gas, No Brakes
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.240]   to make a TV show.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.280]   They wanted All Gas, No Brakes to continue as a web show
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.160]   while All Gas, No Brakes as a future TV show
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.080]   at Showtime or Hulu or somewhere like that
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.240]   was also concurrently running,
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.720]   which is impossible for one man to do.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.760]   And so every TV network said, okay, we're not doing that.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.200]   We want an exclusive rights contract with this guy.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.800]   Next, oh yeah, this is crazy to think about
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.600]   'cause it all happened so fast.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.880]   So Jonah Hill says, A24 Films wants to do a movie
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.040]   instead of a show.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.560]   And they're gonna let you keep the digital brand running.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.480]   So this meant that I could keep doing my Instagram stuff
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.120]   with doing things media/All Gas, No Brakes
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.680]   while making an A24 movie with Jonah Hill and Tim and Eric.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.880]   So it was just like, I was excited.
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.520]   It sounded perfect.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.840]   So they said, okay, what do you wanna make a movie about?
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:55.640]   And I told them, okay, here's what's gonna happen in 2020.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.840]   If Trump wins, there's gonna be riots across the country.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:02.120]   The major cities are gonna burn down.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.120]   If Trump loses, the militias and his loyal supporters
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.000]   are going to try to have a coup in DC.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.120]   That's what I said.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.480]   And I said, so I'm gonna follow the lead up
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.200]   to whoever wins the election
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.080]   and I'm gonna document what happens after.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.480]   So they said, okay.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.240]   And so I was to begin filming in late October,
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.680]   during the campaign trail, maybe mid-October
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.920]   up until November, and then in the following months
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.160]   to see what would happen.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.280]   This meant that I couldn't film anything
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.800]   for All Gas, No Brakes, the digital show,
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.960]   because I had to dedicate 100% of my time
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.320]   to making this perfect movie.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.160]   - Yes.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:43.840]   - Still, one of the partners at Doing Things Media
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.160]   was demanding that I not only produce the movie,
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.760]   but also more content for the show.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.120]   And I told them, there's only so many hours in a day, man,
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.000]   that's gonna be impossible.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.760]   And I said, if you want it to be possible,
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:55.920]   I can make it work,
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.000]   but I wanna have half of the monetization from the show,
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   50% profit split, which I thought is fair.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.560]   If you want me to do double work
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.680]   when I was getting almost nothing before,
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.240]   split me in on the profits.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:10.000]   They fired us immediately.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.760]   Me and my two childhood friends
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.240]   who I hired to work on the show with me
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.560]   were all out of a job.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.840]   As we were filming for the now HBO project,
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.640]   we got our fire notices.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.880]   - The guts on that person to,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.160]   'cause you should be owning probably close to 100% of it.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.200]   - I think so too, but they didn't see it that way
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.480]   'cause they figured we made the initial investment,
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.680]   we discovered him is how they looked at it.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.320]   So it wasn't Reed, but it was the other partner
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.520]   who wasn't Reed who said, we have tons of,
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.560]   verbatim he said this,
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.120]   I have tons of connections in the comedy world.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.600]   We can replace Andrew overnight.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.200]   I'm not sure why he made that miscalculation.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.040]   I wish he would have thought about it twice.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.200]   I wish it didn't have to end like that, but it did.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.240]   - Why do people do that?
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.160]   Like what's the benefit of acting like that?
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:04.080]   'Cause you can part amicably without the drama.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.640]   - I think all betrayal in anything like that
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.360]   is motivated by self-interest,
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.280]   whether that be economic success,
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.600]   social stability, whatever it is.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.440]   They figured that because I was being such a burden
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.920]   in asking for the profit,
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.360]   that they could just release me
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.280]   and find someone equally talented
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:23.720]   and not split them in so they can make more money.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:25.040]   - Oh, I see.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.800]   Well, that's a stupid way to think.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.880]   - People think like that, man.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.680]   People who are, the word I use is like sidekick syndrome.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.760]   Like when people are kind of a part of the production,
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.040]   but they're not integral,
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.600]   they start thinking that the front man doesn't matter
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.640]   or something and that the brains of the operation
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.840]   are actually the people on the periphery.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.080]   And so they start to believe
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.920]   that they can just shift things around
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.120]   and the audience won't care.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.920]   Not realizing that I was actually the one
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.040]   who created the show and that the lore of the show
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.420]   is connected to my rise outside of their jurisdiction,
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.260]   if that makes sense.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.320]   Like the people who watch "All Gas No Brakes"
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.960]   watched "Quarter Confessions" and read the book.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.280]   And so, you know.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.200]   - Well, this happens also not just financially,
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   but just with people that are part of a team
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.560]   but they don't really contribute creatively to the team
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.880]   and they force their opinion or pressure,
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   whether it comes from editors or all that kind of stuff
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.240]   or from sponsors or there's pressure they create
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:30.760]   when the creator alone should be celebrated
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.600]   and have all the power 'cause they're the ones
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.920]   that are creating the thing.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.640]   - In a way, I have sympathy because I can't relate to that
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.440]   'cause I've always been the front man of my own projects
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.480]   by design.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:46.200]   So I'm not sure what it's like to be someone's owner
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.720]   from a content perspective.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.600]   I don't understand the challenges they face.
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.340]   Maybe there was something that I didn't understand.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.180]   I don't know.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.000]   - True.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.360]   Well, oftentimes if you own a thing like this,
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.740]   like this company, you do think about brand.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:34:59.580]   - Right.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.000]   - And then maybe you have a big picture idea
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.600]   what brand means and that can be at tension
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.000]   with the creative project, right?
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.520]   - Yeah.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.800]   - But ultimately freedom for the creators
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.080]   is the best kind of brand.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:16.920]   - Yeah.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.240]   I remember all three of us who worked on All Gas, No Brakes
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.000]   got fired at the same time.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   And we were in the RV that Tim and Eric's company
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.240]   bought for us, which was a bigger RV
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.440]   in the parking lot of a Walmart in South Philly.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.080]   And the propane had just ran out
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.160]   and it was 15 degrees outside.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.960]   So the RV was getting really cold really fast.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:38.880]   And I just looked at my phone and it was like,
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:39.800]   "You're fired."
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.280]   And I was just like, "God help me."
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.520]   But I've had a couple moments like that
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.960]   and God does help me.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.200]   - And they were always in the parking lot of Walmart, right?
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.040]   - Well, yeah.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.200]   Although-
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.640]   - I know that Walmart, by the way.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.760]   - The one in South Philly is great.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.680]   - Yeah, it's great.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.400]   - But technically now you can't park an RV there.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.160]   - Well, you're not a man who follows the rules.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.640]   - Well, the thing is those Walmart, Cracker Barrel
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.400]   and Big Five are supposed to technically
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.140]   all let RV campers park overnight.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.760]   But if there's like a crime problem
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.800]   in the city where they're at,
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.000]   they can lobby.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.160]   Individual Walmarts can lobby with the corporate
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.160]   to take that away.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.640]   So like all the Portland Walmarts,
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.080]   you can't sleep there anymore.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.960]   Any city with like significant homelessness
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.520]   and like petty property crime,
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.760]   the Walmarts are a no-go.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.780]   - Fascinating.
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:25.460]   So that was a low point.
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.300]   - Yeah.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.720]   - And, but from there, from the ashes,
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.120]   the Phoenix rose.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.320]   - Over time, yeah.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.960]   - Channel 5 was born.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.640]   - Channel 5 was born in the March of 2021.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.280]   - After we finished filming for the HBO project.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.120]   - Oh, really?
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.720]   So you went all in on the HBO project?
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.400]   - Yeah, I mean, we filmed the HBO project
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:51.240]   from November, 2020 up until April, 2021, damn near.
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.960]   We were just like, you know, picking up the pieces,
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.840]   going back for individual interviews, stuff like that.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.840]   - So let's go to that project.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.400]   It turned out to be a movie called "This Place Rules."
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.640]   - It was supposed to be called "America Shits Itself."
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.480]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.960]   Maybe you can tell the story of the film.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.640]   You have, what's his name?
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.800]   I don't know if it's down, "Joker Gang" and "Gum Gang,"
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.640]   is that correct?
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.460]   - Yeah, the opening scene.
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:14.720]   - The opening scene of two characters just talking shit
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.880]   and then getting into a fight.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.400]   And that, I think it was really brilliant
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.860]   how you presented that as almost like a microcosm
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:26.480]   of like the division between the extremes of the left
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.680]   and the extremes of the right.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.560]   - That's exactly what it was.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.840]   I'm glad you picked up on it.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.000]   - Yeah, and then what I really liked is that the joke,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.120]   again, "Joker Gang" was kind of,
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.680]   a little bit of a spoiler alert, I apologize,
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.400]   but at the end of the film was a kind of a voice of wisdom.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.240]   - Yeah, I just realized--
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.520]   - He seems the most sane.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.240]   - He was the voice of wisdom.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.460]   He like cut through it.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.300]   - Yeah.
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:52.600]   - I also just realized that a lot of people
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.020]   are gonna stream the movie after watching this podcast,
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:55.860]   which is cool.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.440]   - Yeah, where do they stream it?
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.280]   On HBO Max, right?
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.120]   - Oh, yeah, HBO Max.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.280]   I never got a chance to promote the movie.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.080]   - It's such a pain in the ass, man.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.560]   I wish we could all just pay on it on YouTube or something.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:05.400]   - Yeah.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.880]   - And HBO gets the profits or whatever,
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.680]   but it's such a, I had to subscribe for every single thing.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.240]   But yes, if you wanna watch it,
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.120]   I recommend it extremely highly.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.340]   Sign up to HBO, whatever the hell.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:19.120]   - On the positive note, HBO is great to work with.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.360]   Like, they're the most professional,
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.320]   respectful company I've ever worked with, pretty much.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.280]   - Yeah, HBO has created some of the greatest TV ever.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:29.600]   - But even in the background, they get shit done.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.720]   There's no wait time.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.460]   They have some of the best heavy hitters on their team.
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.480]   For trailers, for posters,
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.200]   all the promotional apparatus they have is super solid.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.320]   - Did you get good notes from people there?
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.160]   Like how to?
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.920]   - A little bit, man, but you know.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.480]   - It's a truly original documentary,
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.040]   meaning I just haven't seen anything like it.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.520]   It's even like, so there's a humor and a lightness
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.180]   at the right kinds of moments.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.400]   Like I said, there's like a rooster in your,
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.120]   that's like, okay, that's like a non sequitur thing
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.360]   as part of a storytelling.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.600]   It kind of intensifies and reveals the absurdity
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:10.020]   of the division and how once like January 6th happens,
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.100]   like everybody goes on to the next thing.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:12.940]   - Yeah.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:13.960]   - It's like, what happened to us?
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.240]   It was almost like a delirium
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:18.040]   that everybody was participating in some weird,
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.700]   just like, well, like people say, mind virus.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.720]   Like all of a sudden we just got captured
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.080]   and people just like yelling at each other,
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.040]   doing the most ridiculous shit.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:30.320]   And I mean, really January 6th,
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.480]   the way you present it especially
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.820]   just reveals the circus of it all.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:36.800]   - I mean, it really broke the fourth wall,
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.180]   or that's how I would describe it.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.760]   Because if you were at January 6th and the lead up,
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.160]   it felt like it was the beginning
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.120]   to a series of similar riots,
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:49.040]   but it just popped off so much that that was it.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.440]   You haven't seen anything like it since.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.480]   It was supposed to be a second one on January 20th.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.460]   It was the actual inauguration, that never happened.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.440]   It was a crazy time to be alive and around.
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.080]   And especially the relationship that I developed
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.920]   with Enrique Tarrio, who's the former chairman
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:03.880]   of the Proud Boys.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.800]   He's now facing 23 years in prison.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.760]   It's like a trip, 'cause I went to his house in Miami,
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.200]   maybe two weeks after January 6th and talking to him,
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.080]   it seemed like he didn't think anything was gonna happen.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.180]   He was just like, yeah, man, that was crazy.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:18.600]   I'm glad I wasn't there.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.960]   They're dumb for doing that.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.520]   He even told me he doesn't think the election was stolen,
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.520]   which is just a mind fuck.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.900]   It's like, why'd you get everyone so hyped up?
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.800]   It's just weird to think about how so many people's lives
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.360]   are drastically altered forever
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.220]   because of that just bizarre moment in time
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:37.520]   that we'll always live on.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.100]   - Yeah, what did you, QAnon, as part of that story,
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:44.100]   what'd you learn about QAnon from that?
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:47.520]   - Just an all-encompassing worldview.
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.640]   That family that I talked to, I call them the QAnon family,
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.440]   but it's called the Spencer family.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.520]   You know, they were non-political up until the stop,
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.080]   the steel movement began in September of 2020.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.720]   And within four months,
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.840]   their entire life revolved around the mythology
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.480]   and lore of Q.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.720]   And I've never seen, in my life,
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.280]   a PSYOP just devour people's minds in such an intense way
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.480]   in such a rapid period of time.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.440]   - And I love how the kids in the movie
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.600]   are also the voices of wisdom.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.720]   The Spencer family, it's the kid who goes
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.960]   through the full journey of believing that whatever,
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.720]   Hillary Clinton is a lizard,
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.360]   and just believing all the worst versions
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.280]   of the conspiracy theories,
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.640]   and then kind of waking up was like, what was the point?
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.160]   - Yeah, it was heartbreaking to see his disappointment
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:41.160]   in his dad for even following QAnon so militantly.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.640]   'Cause he was like, I felt like they let my dad down.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:46.000]   I felt like they let our family down.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.160]   Because January 6th was supposed to be the day,
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.400]   according to QAnon, that the storm happens,
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.760]   and that the military is supposed to mobilize
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.640]   and arrest the members of the deep state,
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.160]   Clinton, Soros, all that.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.520]   Trump was supposed to go into a helicopter,
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.360]   you know what I mean?
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.160]   And take control of the country back from the swamp.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.440]   And it didn't happen.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.920]   In fact, the next day, he was almost denouncing it.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.240]   Now he doesn't, but then he did.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:13.240]   And it was really, I think it hurt people's pride a lot.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.440]   My friend Forgiato Blow, he's a Trump rapper,
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.680]   he describes it that way.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.560]   He says a lot of people's pride got hurt by January 6th.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.560]   - Trump rapper.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.920]   - Oh yeah, dude.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:26.240]   Honestly, there's some pretty dope Trump rap out there.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.080]   I'm serious.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.000]   - Magga rap.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.640]   - Yeah, you would think, oh yeah, Magga,
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.720]   there's no rappers there.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.680]   But there's rappers, and they do a pretty good job.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.720]   - They're good?
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.800]   - Delivering the messaging they want to deliver, yeah.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.640]   I mean, they think of stuff, and I'm like, that's clever.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.320]   - Oh, they have some political depth to 'em.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.160]   - Yeah.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.160]   - Wow.
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.440]   I mean, is there something more you could say
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.880]   about how QAnon works?
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.480]   Like, who's behind it?
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.520]   What's your sense of who's behind the whole thing?
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.520]   - You know, I don't want this to sound rude or anything.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:03.220]   I just don't care about QAnon.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.880]   You know what I mean?
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.080]   I've put so much thought into it,
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.320]   and I just can't seem to care about it.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.440]   - Was it almost a disappointment?
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:19.160]   To me, it was like a thing that just captured
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.320]   a very large number of people's minds,
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.840]   and then it just kind of faded.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:23.720]   - I guess that's why.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.160]   It just seems like it's gone.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.840]   And the ideas of QAnon have just bled
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.440]   into mainstream, standard, conservative thinking.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.840]   - But there has to be a kind of retrospective.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.760]   That's a problem I have with COVID.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.040]   You know, a lot of stuff happened.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.040]   Everybody freaked out.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.560]   There's a lot of big drama around it,
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.600]   and now everyone's like, oh, okay, forgot.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:43.440]   - Yeah.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:45.400]   - Just like, wait, what are the lessons learned?
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.840]   Has anyone learned any lessons?
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.680]   - Yeah.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.520]   - Like, what?
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:49.360]   - Exactly.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.360]   What I'm saying is I don't want QAnon adherents
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.240]   to see this and think I don't care about them.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.080]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:57.520]   - But as far as who is behind it, the damage is done.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:59.760]   - Yeah, but what are the mechanisms that made it work?
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.600]   I mean, that's a really--
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.440]   - What do you think?
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.260]   Have you kind of thought about that?
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:07.120]   - I kind of think that these viral ideas can be driven by,
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.840]   and your film kind of shows this,
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.440]   by just a handful of people.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.880]   And they're not malevolent.
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.960]   They just want to clout.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.800]   - Yeah.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:15.900]   - And there's something sexy.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:19.200]   There's something really sticky about conspiracy theories.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.720]   Like, especially extreme ones.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.320]   You just kind of like, some of them can have this momentum
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.000]   that capture the minds of a lot of people,
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.200]   and you just go with it.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.040]   - Yeah.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.420]   - And like, when I hear some conspiracy theories,
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:33.960]   like, there's something, like a small part of me
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.480]   that kind of like, yeah.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.320]   Like, excited.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.320]   - It's possible, you know, that QAnon is a psyop
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.760]   to distract people away from actually uncovering
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.640]   what the deep state is,
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:47.680]   and who is truly running things behind the scenes.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:52.080]   Because the deep state is just the 1%.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.240]   It's that you get people so close
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.200]   to any type of class consciousness,
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.080]   and then you totally divert everything
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.440]   into like, lizard humans who live on the moon,
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.080]   and that Hillary Clinton is eating babies on camera.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.320]   And QAnon did just that.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.120]   They want to convince you that,
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.760]   one, there's no conservative deep state,
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.760]   which is even more hilarious.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.760]   That Trump isn't connected to a huge,
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.940]   rich corporate apparatus of propagandists.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.060]   And two, that the democratic establishment
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.840]   is the only deep state.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.720]   And that some middle-of-the-road conservatives,
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.840]   that there's no grifters or manipulators
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.240]   outside of that three-headed snake.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.080]   You know?
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.840]   - There's grifters everywhere.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:34.680]   - Everywhere.
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.880]   Everyone wants to make money, dude.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:36.880]   This is the world that we're in.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.720]   It's in collapse.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.840]   Everybody wants to make money,
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.600]   and engagement is the rule of law.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.320]   So anything, that's why these news organizations
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.400]   follow retention incentives.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.820]   They want to make money by selling ads,
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:51.220]   so they try to create fear and constant division
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:54.300]   to enrich the corporate media establishment.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:56.300]   And you have people who are almost realizing,
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:58.260]   hey, it seems like Fox and CNN
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.940]   might be owned by the same people,
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.860]   and are tactically using these machines
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:04.460]   to keep us divided perfectly 50/50
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:07.420]   to ensure that the power structure never gets disrupted.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.440]   And then you get these people,
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.920]   you know who's gonna save us?
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.500]   Donald Trump.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.580]   That's the guy?
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:14.900]   How is that the guy?
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.000]   It's not the guy.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.800]   I don't have TDS.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.200]   I'm not an orange man basher
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.440]   who thinks about the guy all the time,
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.000]   but I don't think he's the guy.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.480]   - You were shirtless,
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:32.200]   lifting weights while whiskey or some alcohol
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.880]   was poured into your mouth by Alex Jones in this movie,
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.240]   and then you did the same to him.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:37.080]   - That's true.
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.480]   - This feels like an interrogation.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.920]   So Alex was a part of this film.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.900]   He was throughout the narrative,
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:48.000]   and you had a great interview with him.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.660]   What did you learn about interacting with Alex Jones
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.500]   from making this film?
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.500]   - For one, is that he's the exact same off-camera
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.760]   as he is on-camera.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.340]   It's not an act.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:03.860]   He told me that all real Americans die before 58.
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.060]   He mentioned Sean Connery and a few others.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:09.740]   - How old is he?
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.100]   - Getting up there.
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.260]   I think early 50s.
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:17.500]   I just found it fascinating how nice his studio is.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:20.500]   The guy's got an MSNBC-level setup.
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.300]   I actually had a great time with him.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:28.220]   It's bizarre because having him in that movie
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:31.220]   created so many problems for me.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:33.400]   And when I interviewed him,
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.700]   I didn't necessarily portray him in the best light.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.540]   We joked around a bit,
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.780]   but it wasn't an Alex Jones hit piece necessarily.
[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:40.700]   But I like to think that I was a bit critical of him
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.140]   in the film, especially the ways
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:45.460]   that he antagonized his supporters to storm the Capitol
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.620]   or to follow that trajectory.
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:51.660]   He told me when I met with him, he was like,
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:53.900]   "I know you think that having me in this movie
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:56.340]   "is a good idea, but you're gonna have
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.340]   "some serious backlash because of that."
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.360]   At the time, I was like, "Man, it's fine.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.200]   "It's all good.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.260]   "We're just hanging out, drinking whiskey,
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.940]   "doing bench presses, drinking Jameson.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:04.780]   "It's all good."
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:09.480]   First of all, I had to campaign to get him in the film
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.660]   because the studios were like,
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:15.860]   there was a bizarre time around, I think it was 2018,
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:18.220]   where deplatforming was the big thing
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.220]   that people were encouraging.
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:22.620]   It said, "Giving a platform to problematic ideologies
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.660]   "will in turn expand their reach.
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.060]   "And so even extending your platform
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:30.240]   "to someone who's problematic is helping them."
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.940]   AKA destroying humanity, whatever it was.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.580]   So that was the whole thing.
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:38.420]   And when I did this media training
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:41.880]   that was mandated by HBO,
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.700]   it was all training and how to defend
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:46.640]   from that exact question.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.060]   They said, "When we put you on NPR,
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:52.220]   "and we put you on CNN, they're gonna ask you
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:55.220]   "about platforming problematic ideologies.
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:56.780]   "And you're gonna have to say stuff like,
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:58.980]   "sunlight is the best disinfectant.
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.780]   "I believe that extremism only goes away
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:02.980]   "when you shine a light on it
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:04.140]   "because leaving it in the dark
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:05.780]   "will only allow it to grow."
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.540]   They gave me like 15 pointers.
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:11.060]   I didn't use any of those pointers
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:12.860]   because I'm not the kind of person
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.180]   who wants to be media trained.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.680]   I like to speak freely.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:18.180]   But in the promotional run for the film,
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:21.000]   when I went on CNN, this was a crazy experience.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.860]   So I went on CNN, and thankfully my friend was with me.
[01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:27.660]   And so I'm on CNN and--
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.980]   - By the way, your friend is chilling in sunglasses
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.380]   laying in the couch right now.
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.220]   - That's Larry Su.
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:37.220]   - It's like the, it's a mix of like the dude
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:41.820]   from "The Big Lebowski" and the Brad Pitt role
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:43.660]   in "True Romance."
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:44.500]   - Yeah.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:45.320]   - You know that reference?
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:47.060]   - No, but I mean, I'm sure it describes Larry Su.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.260]   He kinda looks like Brad Pitt.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.960]   - Jack Kerouac.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.220]   Yeah, it's, yeah.
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.500]   - So HBO had a press tour set up for me.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.700]   And the main ones were CNN and NPR.
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.060]   And so they said, "You're gonna go on CNN
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.300]   "on the Don Lemon morning show.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.560]   "And he's gonna ask you about your life,
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:05.220]   "what led up to the movie, what we can expect."
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:06.060]   So I get in the studio.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:07.780]   It's about seven o'clock in the morning in New York
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.620]   at a show the night before at Times Square.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.780]   So I'm like groggy-eyed, whatever, they put the lav on me.
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:16.180]   Boom, I'm live on CNN, Sunday morning.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:19.140]   And he goes, "How would you describe Enrique Atario's
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.180]   "mental state in the lead up to the Capitol insurrection?"
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:25.700]   And I'm looking around, I'm like, is this guy serious?
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.660]   Like am I sandwiched in the January 6th hit piece right now?
[01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:29.940]   I thought it was about me.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:32.740]   And so I told him, it's not about Enrique Atario,
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:35.660]   it's about how companies like Fox, MSNBC,
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:39.860]   and even your station, CNN, use the 24-hour news cycle
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:42.260]   to enrage people, to generate ad revenue,
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:44.660]   and pit Americans against each other during times like that.
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.140]   And he said, "There's nothing fake about CNN."
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.280]   I said, "I didn't say you were fake news.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.340]   "I'm not saying you're lying, but you're directly
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:53.560]   "antagonizing and stirring people up
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.940]   "against half the country because you need money
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.380]   "to support a dying platform."
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:59.300]   - You said that.
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:00.140]   - Pretty much.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:01.580]   - Nice.
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:02.420]   Great.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.860]   - My mom was watching it, she was texting me,
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:06.700]   she's like, "What are you doing?"
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:07.740]   And I was like, "I don't know."
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:09.860]   And so he goes, "Why'd you extend the platform
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:11.380]   "to Alex Jones?"
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.340]   And I go, "I don't know, I just wanted to drink
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:15.220]   "some Jameson and lift some weights with him."
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:16.340]   You know, I'm just, at this point,
[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:19.420]   I don't support that kind of media, I don't support CNN.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:23.940]   So I just, I didn't give them much information about Alex.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:24.820]   But it was very awkward,
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:27.340]   they'd never posted the segment online.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:29.300]   When I got off of that interview,
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.700]   I had a handler that A24 assigned to me.
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:33.980]   So I had someone with me,
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.540]   and you could tell she was flustered,
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:38.380]   like she was furious about what I just did.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:39.940]   And so she goes, "I just got an email
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.780]   "from Time Warner C-Suite."
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.140]   And I go, "What's Time Warner C-Suite?"
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.060]   She says, "I don't know if you know this,
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:50.060]   "but the same people who own CNN own HBO,
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:53.300]   "and it's Time Warner."
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:55.620]   And so they canceled my press tour.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.120]   So my press tour was finished.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:02.340]   All the late night shows that I was supposed to go on,
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:05.220]   I was supposed to go on the late night shows.
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.980]   And that was off the table,
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:10.140]   'cause they were worried that I was a loose cannon, I think.
[01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:13.940]   And then the only remaining appearance I had left
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:15.460]   was NPR in Boston.
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:17.940]   And that was supposed to be a premiere.
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.780]   So it wasn't supposed to be an interrogation,
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:21.540]   it wasn't supposed to be anything like that.
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:23.540]   Supposed to be a premiere in front of a live audience
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.540]   where they watched a film,
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.380]   and I show up after for a Q&A.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:27.820]   So I'm like, "All right, whatever, it's kind of weird,
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:29.900]   "they only have this one press opportunity left."
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.620]   I kind of felt bad that I ruined the entire press tour
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:33.940]   by confronting Don Lemon.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:36.320]   But at this point, I wanted to just do this final one,
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.100]   especially 'cause it was a viewing.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:39.500]   And I was like, "Cool."
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.100]   I sat in the audience, I watched people laugh to the film,
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.180]   it was awesome.
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.380]   So I go backstage and there's an NPR journalist
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.280]   waiting for me.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.460]   And nothing against people who wear masks,
[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:49.900]   but she had two N95s on.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:54.740]   And two N95s is over the line.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.600]   So I go, "Hey, great to meet you."
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.300]   She doesn't shake my hand.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:52:59.140]   And I go, "Why not?"
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:00.980]   She goes, "You've been around some people
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.540]   "who I don't want their germs."
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.740]   - Yeah, cool.
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:06.820]   - And I'm like, "Okay, okay, this is weird.
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:10.900]   "I thought this is a sort of like fun premiere for my movie."
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:11.760]   We sit down.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.020]   The first thing she asks me is,
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.180]   "How do you think the Sandy Hook families
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:19.740]   "would feel about you platforming
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:22.580]   "one of the most despicable Americans in history,
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:27.060]   "Alex Jones, in front of a live audience?"
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:29.140]   NPR never published this.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:33.820]   The only recordings of it are by a fan named Rob in Boston
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:36.620]   who put it on YouTube, it's vertical phone footage.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:37.800]   And I literally am like,
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.840]   "Well, the Sandy Hook family's lawyer, Mark Bankston,
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.620]   "who represented them in court in Connecticut,
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:45.760]   "told me specifically that Leonard Posner,
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:48.080]   "the father of Noah Posner, who died at Sandy Hook,
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.300]   "was a huge fan of the film."
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.800]   And so I said that to her.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.460]   And that kind of just like silenced that conversation.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.980]   But the rest of the whole conversation
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:57.780]   was just about exploitation
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:00.620]   and why are you platforming mentally ill people
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:03.540]   and giving a platform to conspiracies like QAnon?
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:06.260]   Don't you feel like you're a part of their spread?
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.580]   Some would call you a misinformation reporter.
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:11.340]   All this crazy stuff.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.820]   And yeah, next day hit the fan.
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.320]   - Fuck all those people.
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:18.180]   That film, just in case you don't get a chance to see it
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:21.900]   and you should, you're critical of Alex Jones
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:25.020]   in the most artful way.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.860]   Like it was the correct way to be critical.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:32.860]   It showed him to be more interested in the grift of it.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:38.380]   And you didn't do it in like a pointing fingers
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:41.700]   and like saying in the kind of NPR way
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:43.140]   that you just mentioned.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.020]   It's more like a human way.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:48.460]   Like this is tragedies happen all over the world
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:49.740]   and there's grifters that roll in
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:51.860]   and then take advantage of it in interesting ways.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.100]   And then human beings get swept up on either side of it.
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:58.180]   And it's revealing the humor, the absurdity of it all.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:54:59.900]   And it was done masterfully.
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:02.260]   It was done, like for people who criticize you
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.660]   for platforming Alex Jones or whatever,
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:07.340]   the film from a political perspective
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:11.700]   is probably leans very much left, like heavily left.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:16.700]   But does it without that exhausting energy of like judging,
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:23.580]   just this kind of, yeah, two masks kind of judging.
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:29.180]   - Yeah, and it was just, when all that was happening,
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.460]   when I was under fire from the mainstream press
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.340]   for platforming Alex Jones,
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:35.780]   I thought back to what he said to me.
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:37.500]   And doesn't mean I agree with everything he says,
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.740]   but he told me you're gonna be in trouble
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:42.860]   with these people if you put me in your video.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:44.260]   And it wasn't too bad of trouble,
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:46.940]   but definitely I do think sometimes
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:50.340]   what the film would have been like without him.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.380]   And I think that it was worth it
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:53.460]   because his scene is so funny to me
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.380]   and it brings me back to a different time in my life.
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.220]   And I'm happy that that scene's out there.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:58.940]   - I think it was really well done.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:55:59.900]   - Thanks, man.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.740]   - The layering of it all, the entertainment,
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:05.460]   plus sort of not considering from his perspective,
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:08.620]   the consequences of like rallying people up in this way,
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:10.180]   that it's not just, I mean,
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:12.180]   you really highlight this in the interview.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:15.780]   He keeps saying it's info wars,
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.180]   but then there's always kind of a sense
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:20.100]   that info wars can turn to actual like civil war.
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.220]   But maybe not, maybe it's all just a circus,
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.780]   like we play for each other.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:28.740]   - If you look at the speech he did on January 5th,
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:32.540]   he said, "Tomorrow, millions of patriotic Americans
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:33.980]   "will take our country back."
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:37.180]   So he eggs people on and then when it gets hot,
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.020]   he steps away.
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:41.660]   - Yeah, but like you said, the thing he told you,
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:43.180]   he turned out to be right.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:44.020]   - Oh yeah.
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:46.460]   - And the frogs are becoming gay.
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:47.860]   - They've always been gay.
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.380]   - Well--
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:52.220]   - Saying frogs are straight is even crazier.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.660]   - I've read stories where you kiss one
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.140]   and it becomes a prince.
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.780]   - Yeah, that shit's true.
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:57.780]   - A hundred percent.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:01.100]   You think Alex believes what he says
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:04.100]   in terms of everything he says on info wars?
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.460]   Like how much of it is real?
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:08.620]   - He's right about like big tech censorship.
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:09.980]   I mean, I think if he's right about anything,
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:12.180]   it would probably be the heads of big tech
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:14.300]   colluding together across company lines
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:15.860]   to de-platform certain people.
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:17.340]   He's right about that.
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.860]   I think most of the things that he says
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:21.740]   follow the question everything narrative
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:24.500]   and then everything is kind of like a conspiracy
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:26.780]   or like a plot or a false flag.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.380]   I think that he's built up a following for so long
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:32.220]   that wants him to do that, you know?
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.780]   So I think he'll question things
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.540]   that he probably thinks are relatively straightforward
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.380]   because that's the shtick of the show.
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:41.020]   I mean, the info war is fighting misinformation
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:43.260]   and people want to see him be that guy.
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:44.820]   So to a certain extent,
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:47.140]   if you're a creator who supports your family,
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.900]   you do follow economic incentives
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:51.980]   and people want you to be the character
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:54.420]   and so you're gonna naturally gravitate toward being it.
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:56.140]   - Do you feel that pressure yourself?
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:58.980]   - I did years ago, not anymore.
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:00.500]   I feel like now I can speak freely
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:03.820]   and really say what I wanna say in my new life.
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:05.420]   But when I was younger, yeah,
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:08.380]   I feel like I had to be this sort of awkward,
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:11.060]   sort of amicable, aloof guy
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.100]   who just didn't think anything about anything
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:14.260]   and just was here to listen.
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:16.340]   But now I feel more confident adding some narrative
[01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:18.460]   and voiceover and things like that.
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:22.020]   - So for some people, especially who publish on YouTube,
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:23.100]   the YouTube algorithm,
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.140]   they can become a slave to the YouTube algorithm.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.340]   - Yeah, I mean, for sure.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:29.220]   'Cause, and I definitely feel that sometimes.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:30.540]   I know what works for me,
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.940]   but I like to think that my audience appreciates
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:34.820]   when I try new things.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:37.780]   So I'm not totally enslaved to it, I mean.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:40.340]   - Yeah, I try not to pay attention to views or any of that.
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.020]   - Well, you get some high views,
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.780]   so I'll report that for you.
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:46.260]   - So I wrote a Chrome extension
[01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:48.700]   that hides all the views on anything I create.
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.640]   - So you took it to that level.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.700]   - Yeah, just 'cause it's a drug, man.
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:54.220]   And I'm also a number guy,
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:58.020]   meaning you give me, if I do 30 push-ups today,
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:58:59.380]   tomorrow I'm gonna try to do 35,
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:02.020]   just enjoying the number go up.
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.840]   That's why I like video games.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:07.500]   RPGs, like where you're improving your skill tree,
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.540]   you're getting an extra point.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:12.820]   And there's some aspect of YouTube and other platforms,
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:14.700]   anything, any other platform, you're like,
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.140]   "Ooh, I got more today than I got yesterday."
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.720]   That's really, really dangerous to me
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:22.340]   because it can influence how much I enjoy a thing.
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:28.140]   If nobody gives a shit about it based on the numbers,
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.860]   you're like, "Oh, maybe that wasn't such a great experience.
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:33.420]   "I thought it was a great experience, but maybe it wasn't."
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:37.580]   - Yeah, honestly, I do actually feel that way sometimes.
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:39.820]   I'll put out something that I care about a lot,
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:41.660]   but if it doesn't get as many views, I'm like,
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.220]   "All right, it must have not been as good
[01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:46.180]   "as my high-review videos," or whatever.
[01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:49.300]   - Yeah, that's just not true, though.
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:50.140]   - Yeah.
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:53.140]   - And it might mean, on YouTube,
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.980]   that your thumbnail sucks or something like this,
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:57.820]   or whatever, however the algorithm works,
[01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:00.980]   but that's the thing I'm battling against
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:04.180]   to make sure I ignore all of that.
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:06.780]   It's actually something Joe Rogan
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:07.900]   has been extremely good at.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.300]   He gives zero shits.
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:11.660]   - Yeah, I think it's easier to do
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:12.620]   when you're really successful.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:14.340]   - Well, he was doing that when he wasn't successful.
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.460]   - Really? - But anything.
[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:17.940]   He just follows the stuff he enjoys doing
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:19.420]   and legitimately enjoys it.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:21.200]   He happens to be really good at it,
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:23.020]   but he gets good because he's doing the things
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:27.100]   he really enjoys and full-on passionate about,
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.900]   and that's why he'll have ridiculous guests
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:33.380]   and just shit he enjoys doing.
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:34.220]   - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:35.980]   Maybe I'll one day try to do that.
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.340]   For now, I'm too attached to the gratification
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.940]   of getting a million views in a day and stuff like that.
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:42.060]   I'm not gonna lie to you and say
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.660]   that I've beat that or something.
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:46.580]   - Well, it's a worthy enemy to be fighting,
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.660]   'cause it's a drug, and it's one
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:52.220]   that should be resisted for a creator,
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.140]   'cause I feel like it can do negative stuff
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:55.620]   to your mind as a creator.
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:56.780]   - Oh, yeah, for sure.
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:00.140]   Anybody that controls you is not good.
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:02.220]   A lot of people are controlled by their audience.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:03.980]   They don't have to have a puppet master
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:05.540]   on a corporate level.
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:07.980]   Audience incentive is a different type of,
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:11.220]   I don't wanna say slavery, but--
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:13.780]   - Yeah, it is, and that's why variety's good,
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:17.020]   and you're doing that, always expanding.
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:19.580]   Well, let me just zoom out on this.
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:20.660]   You made a film.
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:21.860]   - Yeah.
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:22.980]   - That's pretty cool.
[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:24.380]   - Yeah, it was a great experience, man.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:26.620]   I mean, it was awesome working with Tim and Eric,
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:28.700]   awesome working with Jonah Hill.
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:30.460]   I feel the same about HBO and A24.
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:31.800]   Everybody that I worked on the film with,
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.580]   I have a lot of love for, and I appreciate the experience.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:35.540]   It's my first movie.
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:36.580]   It's a big deal.
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:37.420]   - It was a good one.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.740]   - In my head, it's like I finally got to make the transition
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:42.460]   from YouTuber to filmmaker,
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:44.780]   and that was always this psychic barrier
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.580]   that I felt like I had to jump over.
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:49.220]   - There's a, I mean, just the way it's shot,
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:52.300]   the humor that goes throughout it,
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:54.460]   just the narration that you're doing
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:59.460]   in a shitty director's chair, that's really well done.
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:01.460]   Whose idea was that?
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:02.820]   - It was actually Tim and Eric's idea.
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.700]   There was a really great editor named Clay
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.640]   who works for Absolutely,
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.660]   and they did all the editing pretty much in the office,
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:11.220]   and so it was Clay's idea to add a retrospective
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:13.860]   director's chair narrative arc to the whole film.
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:16.300]   - Yeah, just starting with the absurd fight
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:19.540]   and then going, oh, that's a good way to start a movie.
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:20.620]   Just really, really well done.
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:21.460]   - Thanks, man.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.260]   - What about Jonah Hill?
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:25.660]   - Like-- - Great guy.
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:27.060]   - He believed in this.
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:28.500]   - He did.
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.540]   - So was that, what's that like?
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:32.060]   What do you think is behind him believing
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.580]   in such a wild project?
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:35.140]   - I think that Jonah Hill has a good eye
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:37.740]   for what's cool amongst the younger folks.
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:39.100]   Like, he's into skateboarding stuff.
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:41.060]   That's why he did that film Mid-90s,
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.540]   and I think he probably saw a similar thing
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:45.880]   in what was going on with All Gas, No Brakes,
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:48.580]   and was like, shit, this could be big.
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:52.140]   And so not only did he actually fund the film,
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:53.980]   he also gave me his agent.
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:56.100]   And I forgot to mention that it was Jonah Hill's lawyers
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.900]   that he gave me for free that got me out of my contract
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.340]   eventually with Doing Things Media,
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.940]   or freed me up to speak about what happened.
[02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:06.340]   - So he was also a part of you kinda gaining your freedom.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:07.220]   - Yeah, in a weird way.
[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:08.900]   Like, even though him and I don't talk that much,
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.640]   just 'cause he's doing his own thing,
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:14.500]   Jonah Hill is like a huge factor in my current success
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:17.300]   and just like everything that I've been able to accomplish.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:19.400]   - Just on your own politics, is it fair to say
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.960]   that your politics leans left?
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.360]   - I'm not really sure sometimes, you know?
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.120]   I like to think that I am socially left.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:32.280]   Like, I think people should be able to dress and act
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.200]   however they want.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.900]   I don't believe in restricting people's social freedoms.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:40.680]   Economics-wise, it doesn't seem like
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:43.560]   leftist economic policy works very well
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.840]   on a city funding level.
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:47.440]   Like, if you see what's going on in California,
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.240]   it seems like the city leadership
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:53.000]   is mishandling the funds in California too.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.800]   So I don't know about that, but I don't know.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:57.640]   I don't really see myself as left or right.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.680]   I just never have.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:01.360]   - Well, if you just like objectively zoom out
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.800]   and don't have an insane standard of the extremes,
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.560]   it feels like a lot of your work leans left.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:13.560]   - I tend to lean toward like the empathetic perspective,
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:16.960]   which I do think is more on the left and the right.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:23.120]   But I also, I'm not into like super like PC stuff.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.640]   You know, I don't believe in limiting free speech either.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.800]   I don't believe that, I believe in a free internet,
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:31.480]   which I think is more embraced now by conservatives.
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:36.480]   - But it does seem that, maybe you can correct me,
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.360]   but I get the sense sometimes that the left
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.040]   attack their own very intensely.
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.360]   - It does happen.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.520]   - But every community has terms of exile.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:47.160]   I mean, look, imagine, think about what happens
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.560]   in the conservative realm.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:50.360]   You know, like when Black Rifle Coffee Company
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.560]   like denounced Kyle Rittenhouse,
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.320]   they lost a lot of money too.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.720]   Like it's not, the right attacks its own too.
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:58.840]   I mean, think about Bud Light and stuff.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:00.000]   Like they--
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:00.840]   - Terms of exile, I like this.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:02.560]   - I mean, you know, like every community
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.920]   has terms of exile.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:07.880]   You just gotta know who you're engaging with
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:10.080]   and you gotta make that decision carefully.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.920]   - It'd be nice if there's an actual writeup
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.240]   of the things you're not allowed to say for each thing.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.080]   - Yeah.
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.400]   - I wonder whose list would be longer.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:19.200]   It just does feel like the left's list is a little longer.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.840]   - If you're a conservative and you have a t-shirt
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:23.160]   with like a demon on it, like say goodbye.
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:24.880]   You know what I mean?
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.640]   You know, there's certain stuff
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.520]   that they freak the hell out about.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:35.560]   - And conservatives are really concerned about pedophiles.
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.320]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't like pedophiles either,
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.080]   but I don't think about it all the time.
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:40.400]   - Which one of the things you do in the film
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.920]   is kind of confront one of the QAnon folks
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:47.280]   where his concern is that everybody's a pedophile
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.600]   and you show it to him.
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:50.480]   - Well, he calls himself a pedophile hunter
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:52.120]   and makes videos exposing
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:54.040]   Democratic elite pedophile cabals
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.760]   and is himself a convicted child molester.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:57.960]   There's an old thing that people say
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:02.960]   that every accusation is a confession to a certain extent.
[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:06.440]   So like, it's bizarre that some people's whole life
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:08.920]   after a big mistake will revolve around
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.280]   trying to seem like the good guy
[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:13.200]   instead of taking accountability for themselves.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.040]   - Yeah.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.520]   - It's a common thing you see all the time,
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.480]   like neighborhood watch people.
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.320]   You know what I mean?
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:19.640]   Like, what made you that?
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:21.280]   You know, like, what did you do, bro,
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.280]   that you feel like you have to get karmic retribution
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.440]   by doing the reverse?
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:25.280]   I don't get it.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.120]   - Yeah.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:28.240]   Do you think to the degree you have bias
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.080]   that affects your journalism?
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:35.080]   - No, but I mean, with the migrant situation, I don't know.
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.320]   - What was that covering that like?
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.240]   - I just got a lot of hate from conservatives
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:41.240]   for like letting the migrants tell their stories
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:42.740]   about their journey and stuff.
[02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:46.800]   - Well, what did you learn from just going to the border?
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.360]   - I mean, just the sheer desperation
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.920]   that the citizens of the world are in.
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:53.640]   I mean, there's people who truly believe
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:57.120]   that America is the only hope for their success
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:58.160]   and to feed their family.
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:01.600]   And I think a lot of them are kind of getting catfished.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:03.440]   - Meaning America has its problems too?
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.240]   - It has severe problems.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.240]   There's extreme poverty here.
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:09.240]   - But in America, like if you just compare it
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:11.640]   to other nations, the level of corruption is much lower
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:16.160]   to where the opportunity for a person to succeed,
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.200]   to rise is higher.
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:20.360]   - I wish success on everybody who comes here.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:22.960]   But my thing is the expectation that they have
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:25.060]   and the sort of American dream propaganda
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:28.600]   they've been installed with isn't necessarily a reflection
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:30.200]   of contemporary American reality.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:32.440]   So I'm talking to people who speak no English and say,
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:33.900]   "I'm here for a better life."
[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:35.000]   I go, "Where are you gonna go?"
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.500]   They say, "I have no idea."
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:39.580]   And I'm like, "Man, that's tough."
[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:43.860]   And you almost think how bad are things elsewhere
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:45.940]   for someone to abandon their family,
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:47.860]   make this journey across multiple continents
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:50.020]   and end up here with no plan.
[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:53.180]   And it just made me realize how sheltered I am
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:54.940]   to a certain extent as an American.
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:57.980]   And walking back what I said a little bit,
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:07:59.500]   'cause I was just trying to make a point,
[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.660]   but what I think of as bad poverty,
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:04.660]   like let's say West Baltimore or Ninth Ward, New Orleans,
[02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:06.620]   is nothing compared to what's going on
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:09.740]   in almost half of the world, if not more.
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:11.660]   And so it just made me zoom out a little bit.
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:14.100]   Sometimes you forget about third world poverty
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:15.340]   when you live here for so long.
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.620]   And you get programmed to believe the worst things
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:20.660]   that are out there is like Kensington, Philadelphia,
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:22.580]   or Tenderloin, San Francisco.
[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:24.060]   But those are just microcosms
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.620]   of more or less functioning cities.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:28.820]   Despite what they might lead you to believe,
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:30.140]   Philadelphia is a great place.
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:31.940]   So is San Francisco.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:36.700]   But there's places where everywhere is really run down.
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:40.940]   - Yeah, and like people focus on,
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.380]   in major cities in the United States,
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:45.440]   like homelessness, somehow that's a sign
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:49.020]   of a fallen empire, but that's a problem.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:53.500]   There's definitely, it reveals some mismanagement
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:54.540]   of cities and government.
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:56.700]   - I mean, homelessness in Seattle and San Francisco
[02:08:56.700 --> 02:08:59.420]   is for sure a result of the housing crisis,
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:01.900]   especially post COVID and all the gentrification
[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.180]   that preceded it.
[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:08.180]   And it's unfortunate now that the conservative media
[02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:11.060]   is saying like, look at Biden's America,
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:13.900]   as if Biden created homeless people.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:17.020]   And it's just disappointing because once again,
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:20.900]   you're seeing the media use real issues
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:22.900]   that should concern every US citizen
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:26.100]   and causing people to point fingers
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:28.020]   at a different political party as responsible
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.460]   for the suffering of others.
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:33.140]   - Do you think January 6th can happen again?
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.660]   - No, I don't think so.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:37.620]   - So all the lessons were learned?
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:38.580]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:41.500]   I mean, people got really screwed over.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.380]   I mean.
[02:09:42.380 --> 02:09:44.740]   - Don't you have a sense that there's a greater
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:49.300]   and greater growing questioning of the electoral process
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.140]   and all this kind of stuff?
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:52.820]   - I think that Americans overall are very comfortable
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:53.980]   with our standard of living.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:56.420]   I think people like going to Sonic
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.180]   and waiting in their car and getting milkshakes.
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.080]   And people like going to the AMC theaters
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:02.300]   and they like going ice skating and mini golfing
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:04.020]   and going to the bar after work.
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:06.580]   I don't think that anyone wants a collapse
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:08.180]   of the basic structure of the country.
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:10.060]   Even the most politically divided
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:12.420]   don't want to see 7/11 go away.
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:14.080]   We are so comfortable.
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:15.940]   If you look at other countries, even Europe,
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:17.740]   look at how they protest.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.380]   And look at the Arab Spring.
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:21.540]   Those guys were talking like January Sixers
[02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.780]   and they actually took control of the government.
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:28.460]   You know, and so think about even if the MAGA crowd
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:29.980]   took over the Capitol building,
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:31.080]   it's just a building.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:34.180]   I don't know, I just think that Americans,
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:36.380]   when they talk about Civil War stuff,
[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:39.140]   it's just so, we're so far from that.
[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:42.980]   Even if the rhetoric is as divided as it was in 2020,
[02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:44.080]   it won't happen again.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.480]   - For it to really happen,
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:49.460]   it has to be, there has to be a level of desperation.
[02:10:49.460 --> 02:10:51.780]   - There has to be a level of economic desperation
[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:53.140]   that's causing people to starve
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:56.580]   or some basic resource going away, water,
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:57.580]   something like that.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:02.020]   - Who do you think wins, Trump or Biden?
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:03.500]   - In the Civil War?
[02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.220]   Well, you know, with the guns.
[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:07.460]   - In a game of Mario Kart.
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:10.180]   In the election in 2024.
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:12.100]   - Oh man, I have no idea, man.
[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:13.800]   I don't even know if I'm gonna vote.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.860]   - It's weird that this is our choice.
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:17.740]   - I know, I wish people were more focused
[02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:19.180]   on like city politics.
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:21.980]   Like I'd rather vote like yes or no for a bike lane
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:24.220]   in my neighborhood than I would for the president.
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:25.900]   - So local politics to you is where it is.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.020]   - I think the future-- - And you feel it, yeah.
[02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:29.300]   - Oh, I mean, you can, your vote actually matters.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:31.340]   Let's say you have a community of 500 people
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:33.100]   and you live in Henderson, Nevada.
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.620]   You can influence whether or not there's a bike lane
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:39.500]   or if this is gonna be a playground or an AM/PM.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:40.420]   You get to choose.
[02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.140]   And you can influence 100 people to choose
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:45.020]   and boom, this is your community.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:47.740]   You can't influence the result of an election.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:50.460]   - Still, those at the presidential level,
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.060]   it sets the tone of the country.
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:57.240]   And so Trump running again and Biden running again,
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:59.980]   it just feels like there's going to be a lot
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:02.940]   of questioning of election results.
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:04.940]   - I just can't believe those are our guys.
[02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:05.780]   - Yeah.
[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:08.580]   - I mean, what is, that's really our guys.
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:09.580]   Like that's where we're at.
[02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:11.420]   All these smart people we have in this country,
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.740]   they have a great history.
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:16.540]   - We got Joker Gang versus Gum Gang.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.940]   Where'd you find Joker Gang?
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:21.740]   - Well-- - Is he a legit juggler
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:22.940]   or is he just-- - No, no, no, no.
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:26.020]   Joker Gang is like a Miami Cuban guy.
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:26.860]   - Oh.
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:29.740]   - Is Joker 305, Rawest Chico alive?
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:32.220]   So me and, I had been following him
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:36.700]   for a long time on Instagram 'cause he used to post videos
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.900]   of himself popping Percocets and smoking blunts
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:40.140]   on the toilet freestyling.
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:41.820]   And so I had followed him for a while.
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:44.340]   And then I finally got this platform and I said,
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:46.540]   "Oh my God, I bet you now that we have a million followers,
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:48.220]   "Joker Gang will sit down with us."
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:49.880]   And lo and behold, the clout did its thing
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:52.520]   and there I was, face to face with the man.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.900]   - There was a controversy a year ago
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:57.740]   where a woman came forward and said
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:00.020]   that you were pushy with her.
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:02.420]   You respected the no, you got the consent,
[02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:04.260]   but you were pushy about it.
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:06.860]   Looking back, can you tell the story of that?
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:08.860]   What are the lessons you learned from it?
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:10.780]   - Yeah, I mean, I've yet to speak on this
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.140]   for a lot of reasons.
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:14.020]   Mostly 'cause it was a hard time
[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.760]   and it's a sensitive subject.
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:18.020]   And I've wanted to prioritize the reporting.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:22.520]   But I think that now I'm ready and able to do so.
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:26.520]   Everything sort of started on December 30th, 2022.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:29.500]   And that was the release date of the HBO project.
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:30.340]   Like I told you,
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.840]   we didn't know when the movie was gonna come out.
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:35.040]   We weren't told that it was gonna come out on that date
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:36.600]   until early November.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:38.160]   And so it was like, "Oh my God, here we go.
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.400]   "We got a movie coming out."
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:42.120]   HBO had, I didn't even know it was gonna be them.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:47.080]   So every day for those 50 days
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:49.740]   to where I received word and to the movie announcement
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.900]   or to the movie release was like,
[02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:54.020]   I was like a kid waiting for Christmas morning.
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:54.860]   You know what I mean?
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:57.020]   It was like every day I just,
[02:13:57.020 --> 02:13:59.060]   I saw the movie release date
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:01.960]   as the first day of like the rest of my life.
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:06.140]   And so I remember the week of the movie release,
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:07.140]   it was like every day I was like,
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:09.540]   "Oh my God, six days, five days, four days."
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:11.460]   And when it became two days,
[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:13.300]   like I was so excited.
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:16.140]   And so like, honestly, anxiety riddled
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:17.960]   because it was such a massive platform
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:19.800]   that I went out to the desert by myself
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.080]   out in the Mojave, got a hotel and just kind of sat there.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.460]   And then movie release day comes.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:27.300]   It was supposed to come out
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:30.880]   at 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:33.600]   I remember it was like 12 hours left, 10 hours left.
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:37.140]   And then eight minutes before the movie at 7.52,
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:40.840]   or I guess it was sent at 10.52 East Coast time,
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:44.760]   I got a text message requesting a portion
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:47.220]   of my fat HBO check to contribute
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:50.380]   toward apparently years of therapy bills
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:53.100]   that this person had accrued after she says
[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:54.460]   that she felt that I pressured her
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:56.980]   into giving consent years prior.
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:15:00.180]   And I was confused, not only because of the timing,
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.580]   but because this is someone that I hadn't seen in years
[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:03.660]   or spoken to in years.
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:06.060]   And I presume that I was on good terms with.
[02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:10.180]   So I didn't respond to the text message.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:13.980]   And then when I didn't respond about seven days later,
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:16.260]   this person made some TikTok videos
[02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:18.400]   and with the help of some friends launched
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:20.040]   an online campaign that got picked up
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:21.620]   by the press pretty quickly.
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:24.380]   - So what did you feel like when you got that text?
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:28.500]   - Well, it's tough because on one hand,
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.420]   I'm not opposed to restitution being part
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:34.440]   of a private accountability process for real abuse.
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.380]   You know, like if you've hurt someone
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:38.340]   to an extent that it took them out of work or something,
[02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:40.540]   like I think they're entitled to some money.
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:44.000]   But unfortunately, as I later learned,
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.360]   this person had legal counsel and this was an attempt
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:51.220]   to basically create evidence by extracting a confession
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:54.000]   from me to use as precedent for a civil lawsuit
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.640]   to the tune of a couple million dollars.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.520]   - It's dark.
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:59.960]   - Yeah.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.760]   - How did you meet this person?
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:03.440]   - Well, I met them when I was 22.
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:06.040]   And like I told you, I was living in an RV,
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:08.520]   making the show called "All Gas, No Brakes."
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:11.640]   And I would travel between cities like every other day
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:14.280]   and so I would basically pick a new city
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:16.560]   and I got in this like pretty bad habit
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.400]   of what I would say is essentially treating Instagram
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:21.080]   like a dating app.
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:24.480]   You know, I would go to a new place, I'd post my location,
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:26.800]   I'd surf the DMs and I would look for like fans
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:27.640]   to meet up with.
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.520]   It wasn't always girls, it was just people to party with
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:31.200]   'cause I was also partying every night,
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:35.000]   but a lot of times ended up being girls and stuff.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.240]   And so that's kind of how this situation was.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.360]   I didn't have sex with this person.
[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:44.560]   Had a consensual encounter that they reached out to me
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:46.200]   about two weeks after saying,
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:48.040]   "Hey, I don't want you to take this the wrong way."
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:51.120]   But looking back, I felt a lot more pressure to agree
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:52.640]   than I realized in the moment.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:55.040]   I don't think this is any fault of yours.
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.280]   I just think that you came on a bit too strong
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.160]   and I didn't want to let you down, so I gave in.
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:04.920]   And it was that language made me feel horrible,
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:07.640]   mainly because if this person had told me,
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:08.920]   "Hey, I don't wanna hook up,"
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.840]   I would have said, "Yeah, of course not.
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:12.080]   "I don't wanna hook up with someone
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.960]   "who doesn't wanna hook up with me."
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:18.060]   And I think that as fame increased during that time,
[02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:19.460]   I think I was just kind of oblivious
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:22.440]   to how people were seeing me,
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:25.060]   especially those who had a digital relationship with me
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:26.180]   prior to me knowing them.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:29.220]   And I don't think that I handled that the right way.
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:32.460]   - Well, thank you for taking accountability.
[02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:36.100]   But just to clarify, you got consent.
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:39.020]   - Yeah, I was the initiatory party
[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:43.560]   in an interaction with a fan who felt it.
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:48.040]   She had to say yes because of, I'm not sure why.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:50.160]   I don't know why, but like I said,
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.480]   this person also disclosed to me
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:53.360]   they had a history of childhood trauma
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:56.040]   and were actively being treated for PTSD
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:58.680]   and that they felt things moved too fast for them,
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:17:59.840]   given their situation.
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.400]   And so I told her, I said, "Hey, if you wanna reach out,
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.200]   "if you wanna talk on the phone, I'm always here for you.
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:05.060]   "I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:07.560]   "Let me know if we can talk further."
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:12.120]   About six months after that, I was at Sturgis Bike Week.
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.980]   And I remember this day, this was the hardest day.
[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:17.140]   I was just chilling and I got a text from my friend
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:19.500]   and it said, "Hey man, you're getting canceled right now."
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:20.340]   And I was like, "What do you mean?
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:21.920]   "Like, did someone find an old tweet or something?
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.420]   "What are you talking about?"
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:26.760]   And I opened my phone and it was this Instagram story of me.
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:28.780]   It was like the ugliest picture of me you can find.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:31.780]   It was like my face open that was like screenshotted.
[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:34.700]   And it said, I remember this specifically
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:35.700]   'cause I just couldn't believe it.
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:39.060]   It said, "The ugly loser who hosts All Gas, No Brakes
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:40.360]   "is a piece of shit.
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:43.440]   "He knowingly abused my friend and got away with it.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.880]   "If you follow him, I'm gonna message you and ask you why."
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.320]   So this person who I don't know,
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.080]   I didn't even know who the accusation was coming from.
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.400]   They text, they emailed every production company
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.720]   that I was working with, DM'd hundreds,
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:59.500]   if not thousands of people.
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:03.080]   Like just saying that like I was this piece of shit.
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:06.180]   And I didn't even know who this person was.
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:09.500]   So I was frantically calling and texting like every person
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:11.180]   that I'd seen intimately for the past year
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:12.640]   and being like, "Hey, are we on good terms?
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:13.780]   "Is everything okay?"
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:17.820]   And then I figured out that the person
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.860]   was coming from Florida and I knew who it was.
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:22.980]   And so thankfully I reached out to the original person
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:24.620]   who I had the communication with.
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:27.160]   And I said, "Hey, like, I think this might've been you.
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:29.060]   "This might've been your friend who posted this.
[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.000]   "Are we good?
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.340]   "Like, I'm sorry."
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:32.640]   I apologized again.
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.980]   I was like, "Listen, I feel bad that you feel this way.
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:38.380]   "I wanna do anything that I can to help you.
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:40.460]   "Again, I apologize."
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:42.220]   And she said, "Apology accepted.
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:43.060]   "I'm sorry.
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:47.160]   "My friend asked if she could post on my behalf.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.940]   "And I'm sorry, I was going through a lot mentally
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:50.380]   "and I saw your fame increasing.
[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:53.360]   "And so I agreed to let her speak on my behalf."
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:56.820]   And we made amends in private.
[02:19:56.820 --> 02:19:58.540]   I said, "Okay, I'm here for you, let me know."
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:19:59.920]   And she said, "Apologies enough.
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:02.260]   "Thank you for taking the time to speak with me."
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:04.380]   And that was two years prior to this text message
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:07.760]   being sent to my phone eight minutes before the movie.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:12.620]   So naturally, I wanted to go on my platforms
[02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:14.460]   and talk about what was happening.
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:17.480]   But I also didn't wanna mess up the rollout of the movie.
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:22.480]   And so the PR firm was like,
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.580]   "We got this, we'll handle this for you."
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:27.740]   And that was, I guess, by way of a TMZ thing
[02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:29.960]   that said, "Andrew Callahan is devastated."
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:31.920]   I'm not sure why they thought that
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.720]   that was gonna make people be in my favor,
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:37.560]   but it was just a picture of me on NBC
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:40.920]   that said, "Andrew Callahan devastated by allegations."
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:42.340]   That was their plan, I guess,
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:45.160]   to show that I was remorseful or something.
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:47.120]   - How much of this do you think lawyers
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:52.120]   kinda pushing this when money and fame are involved?
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:55.760]   - Well, I wish I could say the lawyer,
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:58.640]   but I just can't, that was involved in this.
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:03.640]   But I will tell you that I try to lean away from resentment
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:06.520]   and toward accountability completely.
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.280]   What was my role in the situation?
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.640]   How can I never make someone feel like that again?
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:11.480]   What can I do?
[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:13.800]   What changes can I make to make sure that,
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:15.820]   one, I never treat someone this way,
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:18.480]   and two, to never be in that position again?
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:21.600]   - Well, again, thank you for taking accountability.
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:22.980]   - And the main reason I talk about that
[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:24.480]   is because it wasn't just that person.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:27.520]   There was multiple people who made videos
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.440]   reporting similar behavior.
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:30.640]   And so it's obvious
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:32.840]   that that was a pattern of behavior of mine.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:35.080]   And so I made the apology video
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:37.640]   to announce that I was taking some time away
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:39.880]   because I just needed time away.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:42.700]   I mean, my entire support system collapsed.
[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:45.320]   My friends at the time disappeared.
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:48.360]   I was getting obituaries texted to my phone
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:50.160]   that were like, "Hey, it's been nice knowing you.
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:51.880]   "It was great to see you grow.
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:55.660]   "Good luck," like I was dead.
[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:58.080]   And yeah, it got dropped from my agency.
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:21:59.760]   No one gave me tough love.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:02.060]   No one called me to ask me if I was all right.
[02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:05.720]   It was just only, everyone disappeared in a week.
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:09.440]   - Again, thank you for taking accountability,
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:12.040]   but I just hate how many cowards there are out there.
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:16.280]   Like, when people hit low points,
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:21.080]   it's when you should help,
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:22.800]   when you should stand with them
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:25.040]   if you know their character.
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:29.120]   - Yeah, and it was hard to separate
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:33.780]   the initial situation that I knew was more or less a setup
[02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:37.960]   and the possibly genuine other accounts.
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:41.100]   And so it was like, all right, you know what?
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:43.240]   At this point in my life,
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:44.800]   I wanna be on the right side of history.
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:47.960]   I don't wanna be the anti-cancel culture mouthpiece.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:50.760]   I don't have the mental strength to fight this,
[02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:53.280]   especially because I was envisioning
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:55.440]   the HBO drop to be this like,
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:57.360]   the world opens up to me moment,
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:58.760]   and it was just the reverse.
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:02.440]   But it wasn't so much the media reporting on it
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.680]   that hurt me, it was just little stuff,
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:09.160]   like a childhood friend that you love
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:11.680]   seeing they unfollowed you on Instagram,
[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:13.960]   or just like seeing someone on the street
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:15.400]   that you grew up with and like waving at them
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.640]   and they don't do anything back.
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:20.420]   And you're just like, oh my God, man,
[02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:22.040]   like, this is my new life.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.320]   But what are you supposed to do?
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:27.560]   Thankfully, I like, somehow two weeks after,
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:31.400]   I met an amazing partner who I'm still with to this day.
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:34.440]   And I was able to conquer my two biggest fears,
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:37.220]   which is monogamy and dogs.
[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:39.840]   I was terrified of dogs and terrified of having a girlfriend.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:42.280]   Now I have a girlfriend who I love and two dogs.
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:45.760]   So--
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:48.440]   - What was the lowest point?
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:51.480]   - Well, right after this happened,
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:55.040]   I entered like a recovery programs.
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:58.140]   Started with AA, but then I found a more specialized program
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:00.800]   that dealt with the issues that I was dealing with.
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:03.080]   Say the hardest point was,
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:11.600]   logically deducing that the lives of my loved ones
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:14.640]   would be better off if I was gone, you know what I mean?
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.520]   And thinking that my mom and my friends,
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:19.500]   that their life would be better
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:22.160]   if I took myself out of the picture.
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:26.320]   And for one, I just figured, you know,
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:27.640]   their friend's canceled.
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:28.920]   You know, her son is a disgrace.
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:31.320]   You know, my family's gonna think they raised me wrong.
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.680]   And my friends, I'm a social pariah now.
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:36.080]   I'm a burden, I'm better off dead.
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:38.080]   And the hard part was, you know,
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:42.320]   I would read stories and books written by parents
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:44.680]   who lost their kids to suicide.
[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:48.640]   And they reported feeling a lot of anger after the suicide.
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:52.600]   So I tried to think of what's the way I can do it
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:54.220]   to get the least amount of anger
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:57.400]   on behalf of the people who would grieve.
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:00.640]   'Cause the hanging someone will discover you.
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:02.400]   So I figured that drinking myself to death
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:03.700]   would be the way to do it.
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:06.820]   And I wasn't able to.
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:09.240]   Yeah, that was just a dark place.
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:11.040]   You know, I remember hating the people who loved me
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.040]   because I knew they would grieve and that made me mad.
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:17.560]   That makes sense.
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:18.600]   Like I was ready to go.
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:20.240]   I had no will to live.
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:23.360]   But their grief was like,
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:27.000]   I didn't wanna cause that 'cause I didn't wanna hurt them.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.080]   So I was like, I hated the people who loved me
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:32.720]   'cause they were stopping me from taking my own life.
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:37.540]   You know, and it's weird to think that like
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:39.040]   when I was going through that,
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.480]   if you walk by me in the street,
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:42.880]   I'll look like a normal guy.
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.720]   And so now when I walk around and I see people,
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:48.320]   I think to myself,
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:50.840]   you have no idea what that person is going through.
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:56.040]   It's crazy that so many people are suffering
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:01.040]   in like complete silence and they don't wear it on them.
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.280]   - Many of the people you talk to are probably that.
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:09.680]   Many people you've interviewed before all this and after
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:11.760]   are probably going through some shit.
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:13.680]   - I also thought if I could write down
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:15.640]   what I just told you on a piece of paper
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:20.200]   and I was to do it and then they found the note,
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:22.480]   they would take it more seriously
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:24.040]   'cause they would know that I wasn't lying.
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:25.320]   - Yeah.
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:29.120]   - But then, you know, if you do it,
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:32.360]   it reduces the lifespan of your parents by 15 years.
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.720]   So I looked at it like I was taking time away from them.
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:40.160]   - Well, thank you for the most part
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:41.720]   leaning towards accountability.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:44.720]   It's the right path to take.
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:46.680]   What advice would you give to young men
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.800]   that look up to you on how they can be good men,
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:53.480]   especially in regard to women?
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:55.680]   - If you have any kind of platform,
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:58.560]   whether it doesn't have to be famous on Instagram,
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:00.240]   it could be like if you're a pillar of your community
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:02.240]   in the culinary world or whatever it is,
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:05.160]   just be hyper aware of that
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:08.320]   and remember that you are inheriting a power dynamic
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:12.360]   that can create situations where there might be
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:15.120]   some pressure that you don't even realize is there,
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:17.120]   but it's definitely there
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:18.480]   and you just have to be aware of that.
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:22.880]   And two, when meeting new partners,
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:24.600]   having hookups and stuff like that,
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:27.160]   just try to have a trauma-informed conversation
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:28.440]   about their past.
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:34.120]   Really know the experiences and the backstory
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:36.200]   of what a new partner has gone through
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:37.740]   in that world of intimacy,
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:41.920]   whatever they're comfortable to share, obviously.
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.080]   But I would advise against one-night stands.
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:47.320]   I would advise against hooking up with someone
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:50.560]   that you're meeting for the first time.
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.360]   Have those conversations prior
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:54.720]   because even though it might sound like a vibe killer,
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:57.360]   it's not, and if you think that that conversation
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.040]   is a vibe killer, you probably shouldn't be
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:01.000]   in that situation in the first place,
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.760]   especially now, how hyper-sexualized things are
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:06.280]   and how common that type of violence is.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:08.040]   You need to be able to have those conversations
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:09.480]   and stop and say, "Hey, tell me a little bit
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:10.320]   "about your past.
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:12.200]   "Are there any triggers that make you uncomfortable?
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.480]   "Let me know how I can be the best partner to you."
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:16.440]   And I'm sure that college-age people
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:18.240]   are not having those conversations,
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:20.280]   but I'm sure that it would go a long way.
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:24.840]   - So especially when you're young, college-aged,
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:26.000]   you don't have enough experience
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.120]   to be able to read a person
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:28.800]   without having that conversation.
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:30.400]   'Cause a lot of times you can see the trauma
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:32.480]   without explicitly talking about it,
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:34.400]   but that takes experience and knowledge
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:35.460]   and seeing the world.
[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:38.640]   When you're young and you really don't know shit,
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:41.800]   making things a bit more explicit is probably better.
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:44.840]   - Yeah, and also, as men, we're trained to believe
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:47.760]   that it's our duty to be the initiatory party
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:50.080]   in any type of sexual encounter.
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:53.240]   Like, oh, man chases woman, you know what I mean?
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:54.960]   You have to be the one to make the move,
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:56.480]   and/or she's playing hard to get
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.080]   if she's resistant to your first compliment or something.
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:04.440]   I think that that's not always how it has to be,
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:06.440]   and that extra caution needs to be placed
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:08.640]   if you're taking the initiatory role in an interaction,
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.060]   especially if someone has a traumatic background.
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:13.360]   They might agree to do something with you
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:14.300]   because they're scared,
[02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:16.160]   and you might not realize that's what's going on.
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.160]   But because you don't see yourself as a predatory person,
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:20.160]   you don't see yourself as someone
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:22.840]   who would ever consciously make someone uncomfortable
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:24.080]   or cross a boundary,
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:26.840]   but people have histories that you might not understand.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:30.320]   And for me, as someone who doesn't have much,
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.800]   honestly, like childhood trauma or anything like that,
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:34.320]   it's been an interesting year for me
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:36.080]   working in therapy and elsewhere,
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:39.600]   understanding how that affects the mind.
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:42.580]   And also, I understand that hurt people hurt people,
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:45.120]   and that someone with a traumatic background
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:47.200]   isn't going to have sympathy
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.680]   for applying that traumatic pain to someone else,
[02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:51.200]   even if that person isn't the cause
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:53.240]   of what put them in that spot.
[02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:54.960]   - If we can go back to Channel 5,
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:56.640]   can you tell the origin story of that?
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:58.080]   - Yeah, I mean, Channel 5,
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:00.960]   during the "All Gas, No Brakes" days,
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:03.280]   we used to tell people that we were called Channel 5
[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:05.360]   if we wanted them to stop antagonizing us
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.040]   while we were filming,
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:09.240]   'cause every town has a Channel 5.
[02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:10.560]   So when people were like, "What's this for?"
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:11.680]   If they were being super rude
[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:13.720]   and trying to get in the camera and be hella obnoxious,
[02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:15.640]   we would just say, "Oh, we're Channel 5."
[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:17.400]   And they would be like, "Oh, my grandma's gonna see that,"
[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:18.640]   and they would leave us alone.
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:20.740]   So Channel 5 was a diversion tactic
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:22.600]   during "All Gas, No Brakes."
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:25.200]   And it just so happened that we were in Miami Beach one time,
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:27.840]   and this kid came up drinking liquor,
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:31.480]   trying to yell about whatever they yell about in Miami Beach,
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:32.440]   like titties or whatever.
[02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:35.000]   And we're like, "Bro, this is Channel 5.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.440]   "Be careful what you say."
[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:37.760]   And he was like, "For real?"
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:39.460]   And he just walked off.
[02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:41.040]   And I said to my friend at the time,
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.200]   I was like, "That sounded pretty good, right, Channel 5?"
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.800]   And he goes, "That does sound pretty good."
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:46.720]   He's like, "That's gotta be trademarked, though."
[02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:50.520]   No, it's not trademarked.
[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:51.740]   It's crazy, right?
[02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:53.240]   There's a Channel 5 in every city.
[02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:56.720]   Channel 5 KTLA, Channel 5 Seattle, Como News.
[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:59.700]   Dude, Channel 5 itself, we own it.
[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:05.160]   'Cause no one's thought of something that simple,
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.560]   'cause you'd think you'd have to specify.
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:08.880]   We own Channel 5.com, Channel 5.news.
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.260]   Dude, we own it.
[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:12.120]   It's awesome.
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:16.240]   - So it was the same kind of spirit as the previous thing.
[02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:20.200]   What was the first one you did under the Channel 5 flag?
[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:21.840]   - Miami Beach Spring Break.
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:24.160]   - I think I've seen that.
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:25.240]   And it's gonna be a callback.
[02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:30.240]   I think somebody mentioning eating ass there, too.
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:32.600]   - That would be the place.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:33.440]   I believe that was--
[02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:35.320]   - There's only about five places in the US
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:38.000]   where people yell about eating ass all the time.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.360]   Bourbon Street, South Beach, Miami,
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:43.320]   Sixth Street in Austin, Broadway in Nashville.
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:45.420]   And I'm just gonna go ahead and say Times Square.
[02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:46.880]   You might not think it, but--
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:47.880]   - Times Square, really?
[02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:49.840]   - Yeah, they yell about ass there.
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:51.400]   - Times Square.
[02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:55.080]   - I would say Beale Street in Memphis, but it's not good.
[02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:56.680]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:58.080]   - I mean, Beale Street is like,
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.160]   the median age is too high on Beale Street
[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:01.600]   for anyone to yell about ass.
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:05.520]   - Oh, this is a fascinating portrait of America
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:07.760]   through that specific lens.
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:09.280]   So Miami Beach.
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:14.280]   And then how would you describe your style of interviewing?
[02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:16.800]   Just now that you've collected so many.
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.200]   If you had a style, how would you describe your style?
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:23.320]   - I guess before, especially it used to be like deadpan.
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:26.160]   Now I would describe it as more directed,
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:28.400]   but still relatively affable,
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:31.520]   agreeable, deadpan interview style.
[02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:35.120]   - Yeah, there's a, like in the face of absurdity.
[02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:35.960]   - Yeah.
[02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:37.760]   - It was just like there with a microphone.
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:40.020]   There's a comic aspect to it.
[02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:42.560]   And that's intentional.
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:44.200]   - Yeah, I used to look at the camera
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:46.460]   like Jim from "The Office" back in the day.
[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:47.660]   I don't do that anymore.
[02:32:47.660 --> 02:32:50.160]   - What about the editing?
[02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:52.000]   Like, how do you think about the editing?
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.080]   - I still do most of it, but Susan helps a lot too.
[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:56.960]   It's my associate.
[02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:58.120]   Yeah, the editing style.
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:00.600]   Like I said, we pioneered this editing style
[02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:04.040]   that honestly was inspired a bit by like Vic Berger,
[02:33:04.040 --> 02:33:05.640]   but we took it to real life.
[02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:08.980]   Crash zooms, kind of chopping up vocals a bit
[02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:11.960]   to add comedic timing where it didn't necessarily exist.
[02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:14.840]   Like you might add two seconds of awkward silence
[02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:16.080]   that are built with room tone,
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:17.800]   or you might make everything really fast
[02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:20.480]   by cutting silence and switching frames.
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:22.200]   I mean, switching camera angles.
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:24.440]   But now we try to be pretty straightforward
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:26.440]   'cause we wanna be taken more seriously.
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:31.800]   - Yeah, sure, what's crash zoom, by the way?
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:34.920]   - A crash zoom is when it's artificial zoom
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:36.680]   that you might add in Adobe Premiere
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:39.560]   where the camera zooms in on someone's face.
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:41.320]   - Where the resolution is not there.
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:42.520]   - The resolution is not there,
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:45.160]   unless you have like a Blackmagic cinema camera.
[02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:46.080]   - Which you don't.
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:46.920]   - We don't use those.
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:48.800]   The file size is too big.
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:49.960]   - That's the only constraint?
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:52.000]   - Yeah, 100%.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.900]   - And you also do voiceover storytelling.
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:56.400]   - I think the first time I really did that
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:58.240]   was in the San Francisco streets video
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:33:59.640]   because there's so much content
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:03.560]   about San Francisco homelessness, tenderloin shoplifting,
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:05.880]   but there's not that much context in those videos
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:07.680]   about the history of San Francisco,
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.400]   the housing crisis, nimbyism,
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:12.360]   random zoning stuff that sounds boring
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:14.840]   but has a major role in the current situation
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:15.880]   on the streets there,
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:18.800]   as to why the tenderloin is neglected by police
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:21.000]   and by the city council and the other neighborhoods
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.760]   like Knob Hill and North Beach are so nice.
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:26.440]   So I added that purposely to the San Francisco video
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:29.040]   and then also to the Philadelphia streets video
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:30.840]   to accentuate the reporting
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:32.960]   and add some historical analysis.
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:34.480]   - What's your goal with some of these videos
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:36.120]   like the Philadelphia streets one?
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.680]   Is it to reveal the full spectrum of humanity
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:40.640]   or is it also to tell a story
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:43.240]   that's almost political about the state?
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:45.040]   - Number one is always humanization.
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:46.280]   That's the primary goal,
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:47.880]   is to take people in circumstances
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:49.560]   where they're often news items
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:51.760]   and remind the public that these are people
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:54.600]   with lives and concerns and dreams just like you.
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:57.200]   But secondly, we also wanna start introducing
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:59.960]   more solution oriented journalism.
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.520]   So not just, oh my God,
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:03.400]   I'm becoming aware of how horrible this is
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:05.640]   but what can you actually do to help?
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:07.520]   And as you could see with the Vegas tunnels video,
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.640]   people are responding pretty positively to it.
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:12.560]   Like here's how you can maybe help a homeless neighbor,
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:14.960]   help get them an ID, help them qualify for housing
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.520]   or get a job at the scrapyard.
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:17.920]   There's always ways to help
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:21.000]   but so much of the YouTube world is oversaturated
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.200]   by just like endless videos of people suffering
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:26.160]   and the comments are always like, wow, so horrible
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:28.160]   but what does that really do for somebody?
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.000]   - You've interviewed many rappers.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.280]   - Yes.
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:34.480]   - Educate me.
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:35.320]   - There's a lot to it.
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:36.160]   - Yeah.
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:39.200]   Can you explain this drill rap situation?
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:40.880]   What is drill rap?
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:42.080]   - It's an evolving situation.
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:44.680]   Drill began in 2010.
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:46.760]   Some people say it was Chief Keef in Chicago.
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:48.600]   I think it was King Louie in Chicago
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:50.160]   but I think all of it was very influenced
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:51.400]   by Waka Flocka Flame
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:54.000]   who dropped an album called Flocka Valley in 2010
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.440]   that was like hyper-violent, adrenaline-boosting,
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:02.440]   rap music made by people who were actually in the streets.
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:05.320]   So in the '90s, like if you had 50 Cent,
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:08.000]   you had rappers rapping about like whatever gangster shit,
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.520]   selling crack and beating people up
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:12.800]   but they weren't actually doing it.
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:14.720]   Drill has a true crime component
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:16.320]   to where drill fans want to know
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.640]   that the person rapping about catching bodies
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:21.160]   does in fact kill people.
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:25.560]   So drill is, it's pretty horrifying.
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:28.160]   It sounds great but it started in Chicago.
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:29.480]   Then it spread to England
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.560]   and now it's bounced back to New York,
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:35.040]   like the Bronx and Brooklyn specifically
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:37.000]   and spread from New York to the rest of the country.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.760]   So now there's probably a drill rapper every 10 square miles.
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:45.640]   - So these are, as opposed to pretending to be a gangster
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:49.760]   and killing people, you get some credibility
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:51.640]   by actually doing it.
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:55.720]   - Yes, and the fans are typically not in the communities
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:57.220]   that are affected by poverty.
[02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:59.720]   So they're kind of like superheroes to white kids.
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:02.120]   - It's dark.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:03.040]   - And not just white kids
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:04.680]   but just anyone who's not in the hood.
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:06.760]   It's not necessarily a race thing.
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:08.360]   There's white drill rappers too.
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:10.680]   Slim Jesus was a big one.
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:11.920]   He's out of the picture now
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:14.240]   but there's white drill rappers.
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:15.360]   - Slim Jesus.
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:18.120]   You made a video on O-Block.
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:18.960]   - Yeah.
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:22.120]   - What is O-Block, the place, the culture, the people?
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.480]   - O-Block is a housing project in South Chicago
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:29.280]   in the Englewood area where Michelle Obama grew up.
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:31.560]   It's also where Chief Keef was born and raised.
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:33.320]   I don't know if he was born there but he was raised there.
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:37.440]   And he is the forefather of modern drill music as we know it.
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:40.020]   So these are the projects where drill began.
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:43.440]   It's also the first place where you had that intersection
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:44.920]   of drill music and true crime
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:47.560]   because O-Block has a lot of rappers
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:50.300]   and then nearby is an area called St. Lawrence,
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:54.320]   aka Tookaville, which has a lot of rappers as well.
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:58.880]   And so these two rival drill gangs basically
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:04.080]   have a lot of history and it connects to music at large.
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:06.440]   - So you've interviewed people there.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.600]   Was there any concern for your safety?
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:15.440]   - No, I mean, I think that O-Block has calmed down a lot.
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:16.560]   For one, it has security
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:18.240]   so you can't even really get in and out.
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:22.400]   But two, I think that O-Block's trying to rebrand itself
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:24.200]   a lot because it could be
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:26.120]   'cause Lil Durk's avoiding a RICO charge.
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:27.420]   Could be for a variety of reasons.
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:29.780]   I know you don't know exactly what that means but.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:32.360]   - Lil Durk?
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:36.880]   - Rapper Lil Durk is affiliated with O-Block
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:38.560]   and a lot of people have been murdered
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.480]   in retribution for killings that Lil Durk
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:45.220]   may or may not have influenced the ordering of.
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:47.280]   But anyways. - And Lil Durk
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:51.200]   documented the killings via rap music probably.
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.280]   - Okay, I know you don't know about drill
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:56.760]   but Lil Durk was associated with a rapper named King Von
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.400]   and King Von perhaps paid for the assassination
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.040]   of a rapper named FBG Duck
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:04.680]   who got killed in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:05.520]   It's possible.
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:08.880]   The O-Block Six are drill-associated,
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:10.640]   not rappers but just shooters,
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:13.720]   and they perhaps operated on King Von's behalf
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.600]   when he killed FBG Duck.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:17.840]   King Von was Lil Durk's artist.
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:19.200]   King Von's now dead.
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:21.280]   So there's definitely a concern
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.920]   that some of the fed charges will fall on dirt.
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:24.800]   Not sure if that's true
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:27.120]   but it's rumors in the hip hop community.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:29.740]   So O-Block right now, and when I filmed the video,
[02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:32.560]   is trying to go through a major image rehab.
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:35.160]   If you go on any Instagram of anyone in O-Block,
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:36.680]   they've all converted to Islam
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:38.560]   and so they post pictures of themselves
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:41.200]   praying in the morning and have captions like,
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:44.280]   "Put the guns down, let's pray."
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:45.880]   So I think when I went there,
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.320]   they saw it as a good opportunity to do a positive rebrand.
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:51.560]   And so I interviewed a rapper named Boss Top
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:54.060]   who was there all the way back in 2011
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:55.560]   when Chief Keef was coming up.
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:58.440]   And so he basically ensured my safe protection.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:39:59.840]   But he didn't even need to.
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:00.680]   They're all very friendly
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:03.360]   and they know exactly what's up with YouTube stuff.
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:06.720]   - I like how 2011 is the old days, like the ancient.
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:07.560]   - Oh yeah.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.340]   - The founding fathers.
[02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:10.340]   - I was in eighth grade.
[02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:12.600]   (laughing)
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:17.960]   - Oh man, time flies when you're having fun.
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:19.040]   - It sure does.
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:20.320]   - Lil Durk.
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:21.480]   Where's Lil Durk now?
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:22.320]   - Atlanta.
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:25.460]   - So you left Chicago, not safe.
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:27.560]   - Yeah, I mean, every rapper has to leave their hometown.
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:28.400]   It's what I did.
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:29.220]   - It's a journey.
[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:31.480]   (laughing)
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:34.600]   - Seattle would've taken me out, bro.
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:37.040]   - How's your, I mean, you do interview a lot of people.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:38.520]   I mean, that's like a top comment,
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:40.500]   but it speaks to the reality of the fact
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:42.400]   that you always find somebody rapping.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:46.520]   Or you, yeah, you create the space for people to rap.
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:47.560]   What's that about?
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:48.400]   - I don't know, man.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.060]   - But they're usually really good.
[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:51.540]   - You think so?
[02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:52.380]   - I appreciate it.
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:53.200]   - Well, hell yeah, man.
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:54.740]   I mean, rappers--
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:55.580]   - In their own way.
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:40:57.500]   - Since I touched a microphone,
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:59.940]   rappers have gravitated toward me.
[02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:00.780]   I think there's something happening.
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:02.220]   - You're a rapper whisperer?
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:03.380]   - I think there's something happening
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:05.740]   on a deeper cosmic spiritual level
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:07.220]   that lets the mind of rappers know
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:11.600]   that they have a safe place in front of our camera crew.
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:13.480]   - You have an interview with Crip Mac?
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:14.740]   - I do, free Crip Mac.
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:15.780]   (laughing)
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:16.780]   He's a GO right now.
[02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:17.620]   - Oh, he is?
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:18.440]   - Yeah.
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:19.500]   - Is that a hashtag?
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:20.700]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:23.020]   - What, that's an intense interview.
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:23.860]   People should go watch it.
[02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:26.220]   People should go watch all your interviews,
[02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:27.620]   but that one is pretty intense.
[02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:28.460]   - Thanks.
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:31.540]   - I was a little afraid for your life.
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:34.140]   - Oh, Crip Mac's the safest guy in the world.
[02:41:34.140 --> 02:41:34.980]   - He's a sweetheart?
[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:35.820]   - Oh, definitely, dude.
[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:36.780]   - Yeah, that's fun.
[02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:38.700]   - I feel like more safe around Crip Mac
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:40.940]   than I do with any given pedestrian.
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:44.400]   - Yeah, he was loud and flavorful, I should say.
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:46.060]   So who's he?
[02:41:46.060 --> 02:41:47.300]   What's his story?
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:49.000]   - Well, his name's Trevor.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.300]   He grew up in Ontario, California in the Inland Empire,
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:55.060]   moved to Texas with his mom after his dad left.
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:58.920]   His mom started dating a cop from Houston named Mr. Gary.
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:03.860]   His mom found Mr. Gary getting anally penetrated
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:08.020]   by a coworker, and so she booked Crip Mac
[02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:11.500]   a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. where he joined the Crips.
[02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:14.540]   - That's a good story.
[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:17.940]   (laughing)
[02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:21.180]   - You know, it's true.
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:22.840]   - Oh, you jumped right to Mr. Gary.
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:25.220]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
[02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:28.500]   I'm just saying that he's a classic case
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.820]   of somebody without a father figure who found camaraderie
[02:42:30.820 --> 02:42:34.740]   and a sense of belonging and purpose in a street gang,
[02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:37.720]   which in L.A. is like a rule of law in most of the city.
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:40.380]   - I forget in what context, earlier,
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:42.180]   talking about martial arts and fighting,
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:44.820]   and he's gotta work on his punching form.
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:46.340]   - Yeah, I think so.
[02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:48.060]   He gets into a lot of fights in jail, though,
[02:42:48.060 --> 02:42:51.300]   and from what I've heard, he wins about half of them.
[02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:52.820]   - All right, what'd he go to jail for now?
[02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:55.800]   - Firearm possession, it was a probation violation.
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:56.640]   - Oh.
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.460]   - It's too bad.
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:03.660]   - All right, so Philly, you went to the border,
[02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:08.660]   occupied Seattle protests, you went to Ukraine.
[02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:11.180]   - Yeah.
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:12.300]   - What are some interesting things
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:14.180]   that stand out to you from memory,
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:16.140]   just as I ask the question?
[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:16.980]   Some interesting--
[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:19.740]   - Well, I mean, I was in jail at the border for a while.
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:20.900]   That was horrible.
[02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:21.780]   - What was that like?
[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:22.780]   Was that your first time?
[02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:23.980]   - Yeah, well, you know, I didn't know
[02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:26.980]   that I couldn't hop my own border as an American.
[02:43:26.980 --> 02:43:28.520]   I'm thinking, this is my country,
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:32.420]   I can get in any way that I want, wrong.
[02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:33.460]   You can only enter the U.S.
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:34.560]   through an official port of entry,
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.820]   which I learned the hard way,
[02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:37.420]   'cause I got arrested by Border Patrol
[02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:41.420]   and held as a detainee at a migrant center for a few days.
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:44.460]   - What was that like?
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:45.900]   - Horrible.
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:46.780]   - Which aspect?
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:49.020]   - I mean, well, for one, I don't know,
[02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:51.860]   it was just, to be in a place like that,
[02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:53.620]   and I probably sound like such a wimp right now,
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:54.920]   'cause I know someone's watching this
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:56.540]   who's done some hard time,
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:59.200]   but we thought we were gonna do
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:00.520]   at least six months in jail,
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.880]   'cause the guards freaked us out and were like,
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:04.860]   you're being charged with a federal crime,
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:06.480]   you know what you boys did is serious,
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:08.040]   we're waiting on word from San Antonio
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:10.120]   about whether or not we're gonna extradite you.
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:12.640]   So we're just sitting in these cells alone,
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:16.080]   most of the time in solitary, with no pillows, just a--
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:17.040]   - No pillows.
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:18.560]   - No pillows, no mat, nothing,
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:21.600]   just a space blanket, and I was sleeping on my shoes,
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:24.280]   stinking up the place, it was no good.
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:26.900]   - Yeah, you mentioned the UFO convention.
[02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:27.740]   - Yeah.
[02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:32.620]   - What have you learned from those guys, the ufologists?
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:34.100]   - I really wanna know what you think about that,
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:36.320]   that's the one question that I wanna reverse on you,
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.780]   because you've talked to so many people,
[02:44:38.780 --> 02:44:42.280]   do you think that aliens have actually visited Earth?
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:43.120]   - Yeah.
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:44.060]   - When? - So.
[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:46.340]   - When, exact dates?
[02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:50.980]   I do, I think there's alien civilizations everywhere.
[02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:54.180]   I talk to a lot of people that have doubts about it,
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:57.900]   I just think, I even suspect there's
[02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:00.960]   an intelligent alien civilization in our galaxy,
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:04.920]   and I just can't imagine them not having visited us.
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:07.320]   So I lean on that.
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.520]   What that actually looks like, I don't know.
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:13.580]   The stuff we're seeing in terms of UFO sightings,
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:15.540]   I think that's much more likely,
[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:18.900]   to the degree it's real,
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:21.460]   it's much more likely government projects,
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:24.300]   so military, Lockheed Martin, this kind of stuff.
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:27.040]   - So you think that they have knowledge of it?
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:28.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:30.960]   - One thing I think about with aliens is scale.
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:34.820]   So we have this idea that an alien would be a gray alien,
[02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:37.420]   or almost humanoid lookalike that would visit us
[02:45:37.420 --> 02:45:40.260]   in human form, arms, legs, head,
[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:42.260]   but who's to say that they're not able to shrink down
[02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:45.300]   to microscopic size with the same neural capacity?
[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:49.060]   - Yeah, or just have a very difficult to perceive form.
[02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:51.980]   But I mean, they would go small, not big.
[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:54.380]   - No, I think that would take a humanoid-like form
[02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:56.180]   just to be able to communicate with humans.
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:58.340]   I think that the big challenge with aliens
[02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:00.460]   is to be able to find a common language.
[02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:02.420]   So if you come to another planet,
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:04.540]   and you suspect that there's some kind of complexity
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:07.540]   going on, but it looks nothing like humans,
[02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:09.740]   you have to find a common language.
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:13.140]   And I think aliens would try to take physical form
[02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:16.100]   that's similar, that us dumb humans would understand.
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:17.460]   - Language is really interesting, too.
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:19.500]   I have this series that I'm gonna announce
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:20.740]   for the first time on here,
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:23.220]   but I'm really interested in endangered languages
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:24.260]   in the US.
[02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:26.260]   There's like 150 languages in the US
[02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:27.820]   with less than a thousand speakers.
[02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:28.660]   - Wow.
[02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:30.180]   - And I wanna like help spearhead efforts
[02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:31.140]   to preserve some of these.
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:33.980]   Like for example, Hawaiian sign language,
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:35.580]   15 of those people left.
[02:46:35.580 --> 02:46:36.420]   - Holy shit.
[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:37.980]   - Because when Hawaii got annexed,
[02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:40.740]   the ASL community tried to make it
[02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:42.780]   so the deaf native Hawaiians wouldn't be able
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:45.380]   to speak their native sign language.
[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:47.260]   And so they would do it under the desks
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:49.180]   at like schools for the deaf and blind,
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:51.460]   and they would get like their mouth washed out with soap
[02:46:51.460 --> 02:46:55.500]   and stuff if they so much as did the Hawaiian hand signs.
[02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:57.500]   Also the Gullah Geechee language
[02:46:57.500 --> 02:46:59.220]   in the South Carolina Sea Islands,
[02:46:59.220 --> 02:47:00.420]   Hilton Head Island and stuff,
[02:47:00.420 --> 02:47:02.740]   that's like a, it's almost a Creole language
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:04.860]   that's been in the US for hundreds of years
[02:47:04.860 --> 02:47:06.500]   existing in isolation.
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:09.700]   That's being threatened by golf course developments.
[02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:11.460]   I don't know how into language you are,
[02:47:11.460 --> 02:47:14.260]   but I've been getting super nerded out about it.
[02:47:14.260 --> 02:47:15.980]   - Actually, I'm interviewing somebody tomorrow
[02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:17.740]   who's an expert in human language.
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:18.860]   He's from MIT.
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:22.980]   Studying the syntax of a lot of languages,
[02:47:22.980 --> 02:47:25.580]   including in the Amazon jungle,
[02:47:25.580 --> 02:47:29.540]   the peoples that live in the Amazon jungle region.
[02:47:29.540 --> 02:47:30.860]   Yeah, it's fascinating.
[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:31.980]   Human language is fascinating.
[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:34.020]   And also the barriers it creates.
[02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:36.060]   And also how the games are played
[02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:38.380]   to what you're speaking by governments.
[02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:41.740]   This is part of the story of Russia and Ukraine,
[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:43.940]   is a battle over language.
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:49.940]   The Ukrainian language is a symbol of independence,
[02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:53.420]   which is why they were trying to make it
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:55.540]   the primary language of the nation.
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:59.020]   So sometimes the language represents
[02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:00.620]   the culture and the peoples.
[02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:01.460]   - Yeah.
[02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:04.660]   - And it's intricately tied to the culture of the people.
[02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:06.300]   - I've been trying to learn Navajo.
[02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:08.380]   - Which languages do you know?
[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:09.900]   - Spanish and English.
[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:12.700]   - Spanish well?
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:13.820]   - Si.
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:14.860]   (laughs)
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:17.780]   - I don't know Spanish that well, so that passes me.
[02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:19.380]   You're fluent, basically.
[02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:20.220]   Oh, it doesn't.
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:22.780]   Hola.
[02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:23.900]   - That was good.
[02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:25.660]   That was real Cancun spring break.
[02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:27.340]   - Well, I actually speak fluent Spanish
[02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:29.420]   according to Spotify 'cause there's,
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:34.020]   every episode is translated, overdubbed by AI in Spanish.
[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:34.860]   - Oh my God.
[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:35.700]   - Yeah, there's a very--
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:36.540]   - Do you have a Spanish robot assigned to you?
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:38.580]   - I have a Spanish robot.
[02:48:38.580 --> 02:48:42.660]   I sound incredibly intelligent and intellectual in Spanish.
[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:44.420]   - Say hello to Friedman.
[02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:45.260]   - Exactly.
[02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:51.260]   From everything you've done, all the people you've seen,
[02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:56.260]   do you think most people are good underneath it all?
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:57.220]   - Yeah.
[02:48:57.220 --> 02:49:00.940]   - So the ones that do all the extreme shit.
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:02.380]   - Okay, I'll put it like this.
[02:49:02.380 --> 02:49:05.940]   Most people think they're doing the best thing for the world.
[02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:07.740]   I don't think anyone,
[02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:10.380]   except for maybe a small fraction of sociopaths,
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:11.660]   wakes up every day and says,
[02:49:11.660 --> 02:49:13.660]   "I'm gonna fuck somebody's life up today."
[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.100]   I think the far majority of people
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:17.100]   are fighting for what they think is right
[02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:19.140]   and do want to see America succeed
[02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:20.780]   and want us to be in a happy place
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:22.340]   where no one is subjugated.
[02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:24.980]   I just think people have drastically different ideas
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:27.100]   of what means will get us there.
[02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:29.300]   And unfortunately, that's leading to a lot
[02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:32.180]   of misunderstandings between cultures.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:35.060]   And yeah, I think that most people are good.
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:36.860]   I've been through some things that leads me to believe
[02:49:36.860 --> 02:49:37.780]   that a lot of people, though,
[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:41.500]   are primarily motivated by self-interest.
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:44.140]   And that in a fight or flight situation,
[02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:45.780]   most people will choose flight.
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:49.220]   So I don't know if people are courageous as a whole,
[02:49:49.220 --> 02:49:51.420]   but I think generally good.
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:53.380]   But the energy to stand up for what's right,
[02:49:53.380 --> 02:49:54.780]   not sure about that.
[02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:57.580]   - They have the capacity, though, to do good.
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:00.240]   - I think human beings are inherently selfish as well.
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:04.780]   But I don't think that selfish is inherently bad.
[02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:07.980]   I think humans are primarily motivated by self-interest,
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:12.900]   but generally have positive intentions.
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:16.980]   - I do hope more humans rise to the occasion
[02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:18.660]   and have courage.
[02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:21.460]   Courage of their convictions, courage to have integrity.
[02:50:21.460 --> 02:50:25.140]   But yeah, I think that most people are good,
[02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:26.600]   and they want to do good,
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:28.900]   and they have the capacity to do a lot of good.
[02:50:28.900 --> 02:50:32.940]   That's why I have hope for this whole thing
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:34.300]   we've got going on.
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:35.780]   How do you heal the misunderstandings
[02:50:35.780 --> 02:50:36.780]   between people, you think?
[02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:39.520]   Listening, it's the only option we have.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:44.300]   No forced education, no forced meetings or mediations
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:46.260]   between political opponents.
[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:49.180]   Just listen to more people, and really listen.
[02:50:49.180 --> 02:50:51.220]   Try to get rid of whatever preconceived notions
[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:52.900]   you might have about how you should feel
[02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:55.060]   about someone you are supposed to disagree with,
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:56.660]   and just keep your ears and your heart open
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:50:59.460]   to people that you don't know, and your life will change.
[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:01.700]   - Keep your heart open.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:03.660]   - A lot of people are scared to listen.
[02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:07.580]   - Well, Andrew, I'm a big fan, and thank you
[02:51:07.580 --> 02:51:10.700]   for being one of the best listeners in the world.
[02:51:10.700 --> 02:51:11.540]   - Amen.
[02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:14.740]   - And showing the full spectrum of humanity to us
[02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:17.380]   so we can listen as well and learn.
[02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:20.300]   And just thank you for doing everything you're doing.
[02:51:20.300 --> 02:51:21.140]   Keep doing it.
[02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:22.220]   - Hey man, thanks so much for having me on.
[02:51:22.220 --> 02:51:23.300]   You're a great man.
[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:24.140]   - Thank you, brother.
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.540]   - I appreciate it.
[02:51:25.540 --> 02:51:27.340]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:28.740]   with Andrew Kalkin.

[02:51:34.540 --> 02:51:37.020]   from Hunter S. Thompson.
[02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:40.620]   The edge, there is no honest way to explain it
[02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:43.900]   because the only people who really know where it is
[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:46.060]   are the ones who have gone over.
[02:51:46.060 --> 02:51:50.580]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.

[02:51:53.180 --> 02:51:55.780]   (upbeat music)
[02:51:55.780 --> 02:51:57.840]   you
