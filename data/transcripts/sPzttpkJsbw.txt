[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm not a Christian because I attend church on Sunday, and neither are you, and neither
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.560]   is John Piper.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   This was a discovery Piper made in the opening pages of a book by C.S. Lewis.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.760]   In God's Providence, a thin little blue book by the title "The Weight of Glory" found its
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.640]   way into Piper's life at age 23.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.080]   Here's how he recounted the story in a 2015 sermon.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.280]   One way that broke over me in my 23rd year was the discovery that my desires were not
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.620]   too strong but too weak.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.360]   And the remedy for my early perplexity did not lie in getting rid of my desires but on
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.960]   glutting them on God.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.380]   That was revolutionary to me.
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.120]   Your problem longing, aching, yearning, wanting John Piper is that you don't yet want like
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120]   you ought to want.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.440]   I will come to you and I will put a fire under the fire of want.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.680]   You want to know what want is?
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.720]   I'll show you what want is.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.980]   And he puts his glory in front of you and fills you with his Holy Spirit and you discover
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.320]   what want is.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.520]   C.S. Lewis was the one who unlocked the door.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.580]   I'm standing in Vroman's bookstore on Colorado Avenue having read I think "Mere Christianity"
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.160]   and that was all in college.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.280]   I look at a table, I think they were on sale or something, while they're out on the table,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.800]   a little blue book called "The Weight of Glory" by C.S.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   Lewis.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200]   I pick it up and open to the first page and read this.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.640]   The New Testament has lots to say about self-denial but not about self-denial as an end in itself.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   Boy has it got my attention.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.800]   We are told to deny ourselves and to take up our crosses in order that we may follow
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.480]   Christ and nearly every description of what we shall ultimately find, if we do, contains
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   an appeal to desire.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.320]   If there lurks in the most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and earnestly
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.360]   to hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I submit this notion crept in from Immanuel
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.080]   Kant and the Stoics and has no part in the Christian faith.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.480]   Are you kidding me?
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   No part?
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.920]   I thought it was the part.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.120]   Has no part in the Christian faith.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.680]   Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.840]   rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.640]   strong but too weak.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.200]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.360]   joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in the
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.520]   slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by a holiday at the sea.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.680]   We are far too easily pleased.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.800]   I have written many times, "Books don't change people.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.360]   Paragraphs change people."
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   That's all you remember when you're done with the book.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   That.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   That's enough.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.520]   That's world-shaking.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.440]   Whatever else was in the book, that changed the world.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.680]   And then I saw it, of course, as you have, all over the Bible.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.800]   As a deer pants for the flowing streams, so my pants, so...
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.400]   Not my pants.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Start over again.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   Get that one right.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.520]   Edit or leave it.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.720]   It's funny.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   As a deer pants for the flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.520]   My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.440]   When shall I come and behold God?
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   Psalm 42.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   Psalm 43.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.880]   Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.440]   Psalm 37.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.600]   Delight yourself in the Lord.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.400]   Give you the desires of your heart.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.440]   Psalm 100, verse 2.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.520]   Serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.040]   To sin, to serve the Lord another way.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.720]   Rejoice in the Lord, and again I say, rejoice.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.000]   Philippians 4.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.640]   So the mandate, the mandate from God to enjoy God was not, to my amazement, marginal.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   This was central.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760]   This was pervasive.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.200]   Being satisfied in God was not icing on the cake of Christianity.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.160]   It wasn't to caboose at the end of the train.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.980]   Don't mean to be offending anybody, except a little bit.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.920]   It was the essence and the heart of Christianity.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.200]   Christianity, now get this, Southern Bible Belt people.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.360]   Christianity, Presbyterian, Baptist, you name it.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.520]   Christianity is not a willpower religion.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.320]   It is not a religion of decisions to do what you don't want to do.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.720]   It is a supernatural work of God by which you are born again so that you want God more
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.080]   than you want anything.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.200]   And if you don't want God more than you want anything, you're not a Christian.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.120]   That's what the new birth is.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.560]   It takes hearts that are in love with the world and puts them in love with Christ and
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   his Father and the Gospel and the glory of being saved and promised to go into everlasting
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   paradise of joy.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.200]   And if it's a ho-hum, boring, insignificant thing to you and everything else in the world
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.560]   is real to you, you're not a Christian.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.080]   I don't care how many decisions you've made, how many aisles you've walked, how many cards
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   you've signed.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.480]   I don't care what you do, what church you go to.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.320]   That's not Christianity.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.400]   That was the revolution for me.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   It is very threatening.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.720]   Yes, it is.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.920]   It's terrifying to learn that my heart has to be changed in order to be a Christian.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.520]   I have to have values that are new, passions that are new, desires that are new, joys that
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   are new.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.040]   New things make me happy.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   I don't need to start going to church.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   Yuck.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.040]   Who wants to call that Christianity?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.440]   It's not.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   That was a revolution for me.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   My desires were not too strong.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.520]   They were too weak.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:58.840]   Because to become a Christian is to be given a new heart, which means new passions, new
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.280]   desires, new longings.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.760]   Jesus now is your highest treasure.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.840]   I count everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Jesus Christ,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.520]   my Lord, is normal Christianity.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.360]   Such a valuable clip.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.840]   This was sent in to us by a listener with a very French name that I'm sure I would butcher
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   if I even attempted to pronounce it.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.960]   Listener in Quebec, Canada, thank you for this clip.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.480]   The Lord knows who you are.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.440]   We're grateful for you.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.680]   This sermon was preached on October 9th, 2015 in South Carolina.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.880]   It's titled, "The Glory of God as the Ground of the Mind's Certainty and the Goal of the
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.320]   Soul's Satisfaction."
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   What a title.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   Let me say that again.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.000]   "The Glory of God as the Ground of the Mind's Certainty and the Goal of the Soul's Satisfaction."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.960]   The full message, of course, is on our site at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.080]   Well, should we make a decision in life with a coin toss?
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.520]   Why or why not?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.560]   That's the question on the table tomorrow.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you then.
