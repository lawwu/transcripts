[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]   The ideas that I am talking about are ideas
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.420]   that are widely supported.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.180]   Everything that I talk about, raising the minimum
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.840]   wage, healthcare for all, a tax system which
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.220]   demands the billionaires pay their fair share,
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.000]   those are all popular ideas, but people didn't know.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500]   You gotta run for president and have 20,000
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300]   people come out to your rallies and win 23 states.
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.100]   They say, "Hmm, well, maybe those ideas are not
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.100]   "so crazy after all, and we gotta entertain 'em."
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.660]   The establishment doesn't like that, they really don't.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.140]   They wanna tell you, and this is their main,
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.660]   this is how they succeed.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.980]   What they say, Lex, is the world is the way it is,
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.600]   it always will be this way, we got the wealth,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.180]   we got the power, and don't think of anything else.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.200]   This is the way it is.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.940]   You have no power, give up.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.220]   That, they don't say it quite that way,
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.260]   but that's really what the intent is.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.860]   And what we showed is, guess what?
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.740]   You know, running an outsider campaign,
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.380]   we took on the Democratic establishment,
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.260]   we came close to winning it, and we did win 23 states,
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.780]   and the ideas that we're talking about are the ideas
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.380]   that working class people, young people, believe in.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.440]   - The following is a conversation with Bernie Sanders,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.940]   senator from Vermont and two-time presidential candidate,
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.240]   both times as the underdog who, against the long odds,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620]   captivated the support and excitement of millions of people,
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.780]   both on the left and the right.
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.580]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.660]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.900]   in the description.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.640]   And now, dear friends, here's Bernie Sanders.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.140]   Growing up, did you ever think you'd be a politician?
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740]   - Nope, not in a million years.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.540]   - Yeah, I know that you hate talking about yourself,
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.420]   which is rare for a politician, I would say.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.900]   (laughing)
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.140]   What's your philosophy behind that?
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140]   You like talking about the issues, you like talking about--
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.540]   - I mean, you know, everybody talks about themselves.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.900]   It's not about me, you know, nice guy, not a nice guy.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.220]   What politics should be about is the issues facing
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.060]   the people of our country, the people of the world,
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.180]   and how we're gonna address it.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.100]   That's what it should be.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.260]   - That said, there's interesting aspects to your life story.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.220]   For example, in 1963, you were very active
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.540]   in the Civil Rights Movement, got arrested even
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.420]   for protesting segregation in Chicago,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.160]   and you attended the famous March on Washington,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.740]   where MLK gave his "I Have a Dream" speech.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.900]   What was that like?
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.340]   - It was extraordinary.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340]   Took a bus ride down with fellow students
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.700]   from the University of Chicago,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.260]   and there was a zillion people there.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.980]   I'm not sure if it was the first time I'd ever been
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.980]   in Washington in my life, but it was, you know,
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.780]   it was a very impressive moment.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.940]   And what he was talking about,
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.980]   what people very often forget about that,
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.300]   it was not only racial justice, it was jobs.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.820]   Jobs and justice, that was the name of that rally.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.740]   And so, it's something I've never forgotten.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.420]   - What influence did he have on you?
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.380]   What'd you learn about the way he enacted change
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.220]   in the world?
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.800]   - King was a very impressive guy.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.740]   More impressive, I think, than people think that he was.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.820]   And what he did is he created his movement
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.860]   from the bottom on up.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.580]   So, he developed real organization,
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.980]   grassroots organization, which put pressure
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.420]   on communities and officials to end segregation,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.280]   to open up voting patterns.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.540]   And I think what has to also be remembered about King,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.100]   which is really quite extraordinary,
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.540]   is, you know, he won the Nobel Peace Prize,
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.340]   and everyone's, "Oh, you're great, you're wonderful."
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.260]   But then, to the end of his life,
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.500]   he took on Lyndon Johnson on the war in Vietnam.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.860]   And as soon as he did that, suddenly the editorial pages
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.880]   throughout America, establishment papers,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.300]   no longer thought he was so great.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.060]   In fact, the message sent out,
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.140]   "You're black, deal with civil rights.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.420]   "Don't worry about foreign policy.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.260]   "We'll take care of that."
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.840]   But he said, "You know, if I talk about peace
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.400]   "and nonviolence, I can't sit back
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.140]   "and allow what's going on in Vietnam
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.640]   "to continue without speaking out."
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.740]   Incredible courage to do that.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.940]   And, by the way, when he was assassinated
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.740]   at a fighting for the rights of AFSCME workers,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.940]   garbage, guys who delivered the garbage,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.540]   who were treated terribly, low wages,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.180]   bad working conditions, and who went out
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.300]   to support their right to form a union,
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.220]   that's when he got killed.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.180]   - So on the war front, one of the things
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.740]   that people don't often talk about your work in politics,
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.300]   you gave what I think is a truly brave speech
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.220]   on the Iraq war in 2002, I believe.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   You voted no on the Iraq Resolution,
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.420]   you voted no on the Patriot Act,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.420]   and you basically predicted very accurately
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.860]   what would happen if we go into Iraq.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.820]   What was your thinking at the time
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.540]   behind those speeches, behind voting no
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.300]   on the Patriot Act, on the Iraq Resolution?
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.580]   - It maybe, ironically, came out of maybe
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.620]   the war in Vietnam and the ease and lies
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.780]   that people told.
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.940]   We went into Vietnam under a lie.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.100]   We lost close to 60,000 Americans,
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.140]   millions of people in Vietnam.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.500]   Cambodia died as a result of that.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.780]   So you think twice about it.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.340]   And then the war in Iraq, you had people
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.980]   like Dick Cheney and others telling us,
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.100]   oh, they have nuclear weapons and all that stuff,
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.140]   it's the only way we can resolve the issue.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.260]   I didn't believe it.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.380]   I didn't agree with it.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.220]   And you're right.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.700]   Turns out, historically, I was right.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.580]   - What's the way to fight this thing
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.380]   that Martin Luther King tried to fight,
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.140]   which is the military-industrial complex?
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.980]   - It's huge.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.420]   I mean, it gets to the broader issue
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.260]   of where we are as a nation.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.020]   And what I, almost uniquely in Congress,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.820]   talk about is the fact that we are moving
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.820]   Lex to an oligarchic form of society.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.300]   And not a lot of people are familiar
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.700]   with that term, but what it means,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.500]   we talk about oligarchy in Russia,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.780]   and oh, Putin is surrounded by the oligarchs.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.620]   Well, guess what?
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.860]   What do you think is happening in the United States?
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.420]   So what you have right now is an economy
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.180]   with more concentration of ownership
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.700]   than we've ever had, right?
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.260]   That means whether it's agriculture,
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.020]   transportation, healthcare, whatever it may be,
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.520]   fewer and fewer massively large corporations
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.580]   control what's produced and the prices we pay.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.740]   And then you look at our political system,
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.700]   and it's, we don't talk about it.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.560]   What is the reality of the political system today?
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.260]   And that is that billionaires are spending
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.800]   huge amounts of money to buy this election.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.100]   In Trump's campaign, he got three multi-billionaires
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.720]   spending over $200 million, three people.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.140]   Democrats have their billionaires
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.740]   not quite as concentrated.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.500]   But at the end of the day, billionaires
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.020]   play an enormous role in terms of electing politicians,
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.460]   and in Washington in determining
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.220]   what legislation gets seen and not seen.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.620]   - But it's not just single billionaires.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.380]   It's companies with lobbyists.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.500]   - You got it.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.460]   Let me give you one example, lobbyists.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.340]   We pay in the United States by far
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.500]   the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.140]   This is an issue I've been working hard on,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.440]   with some success.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.880]   Take a wild and crazy guess.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.540]   How many lobbyists are there from the drug companies
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.420]   in Washington, D.C.?
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.660]   - Well, over 1,000.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.180]   - Over 1,000, right?
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.860]   There are 100 members of the Senate,
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.940]   435 members of the House, 535 members of Congress.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.900]   There are 1,800 well-paid lobbyists
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.420]   representing the drug companies,
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.660]   including former leaders of the Republican
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.700]   and Democratic Party.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.080]   That is why, one of the reasons why,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.420]   we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.300]   Military-industrial complex.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.020]   You got a revolving door.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.700]   People go from the military into the General Dynamics,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.780]   into Lockheed Martin and the other large companies.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.620]   And what we see there is an institution in the Pentagon.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.560]   We spend a trillion dollars a year on the Pentagon.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.980]   It is the only federal agency that cannot,
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.820]   is not able to submit to an independent audit.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.820]   So if you think there's not massive fraud and waste
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.300]   and cost overruns in the Pentagon,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.540]   you would be sorely mistaken.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.320]   - Do you think most politicians are corrupt
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.560]   in accepting the money, or is the system corrupt,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.300]   or is it a bit of both?
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.620]   - If the corrupt means that, "Hey, here's $10,000.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.980]   "Vote this way."
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.900]   Doesn't work like that.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.500]   Very, very rare occasionally.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.340]   Very, very rare.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.340]   That's corruption.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.140]   What happens is that if you are in a campaign,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.580]   and right now, the amount of money
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.700]   that people have to raise.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.340]   You're running for Senate in Ohio.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.900]   You're talking about 50, 60 million dollars.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.340]   Where the hell are you gonna get that money?
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.220]   It's not gonna be $10 donations.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.660]   You're gonna be surrounding yourself
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.500]   with people who have the money.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.220]   You're gonna go $5,000 plate dinners, et cetera.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.180]   So you surround yourself with those people who say,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.860]   "Oh, these are my problems.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.140]   "This is what I need.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.660]   "I need a tax break for billionaires."
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.900]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.220]   So you become, you live in that world.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.860]   They are your financial support.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.220]   They are, in a sense, your political base.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.460]   So you're very cognizant of what you do
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.100]   in terms of not upsetting them.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.340]   So it's not corruption in the sense of people
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.820]   taking envelopes with huge amounts of money
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.820]   to vote a certain way.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.340]   That very, very rarely, if ever, happens.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.660]   It is the power of big money
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.180]   to make politicians dependent on those folks.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.860]   And that's why, when I ran for president,
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.980]   what I'm probably maybe most proud of
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.460]   is the fact that we received millions and millions
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.060]   of campaign contributions,
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.140]   averaging 27 bucks apiece, I think, in 2016.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.780]   - Have companies, lobbyists ever try to buy you,
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.140]   try to influence you?
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.980]   - We don't welcome them into our office.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.260]   I do deal with these guys,
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.380]   but it's usually on a confrontational tone, no.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.540]   So they don't come into my office very often
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.780]   telling me their problems.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.560]   - So how do we fix the system?
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.620]   How do we get money out of politics?
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.900]   - This is not, you know, like many other issues,
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.500]   we don't have to reinvent the wheel here.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.220]   It exists in other countries.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.700]   If you go to, you know,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.940]   every country has their own election system,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.740]   but nobody has a system where billionaires
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.780]   can spend unlimited sums of money through super PACs
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.260]   to elect the candidates of their choice.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.100]   So first thing you gotta do,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.740]   and it, you know, one of the things, Lex,
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.740]   I found that the more important the issue,
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.260]   the less discussion there is.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.100]   The less important the issue,
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.700]   the more discussion there is.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.980]   A number of years ago,
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.620]   the United States Supreme Court,
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.380]   in one of its more pathetic decisions,
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.500]   passed the Citizens United decision.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   And what Citizens United decision said is,
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.260]   you're a multi-billionaire.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.880]   You want the freedom.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.180]   You're a free person in a free country.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.940]   You want the freedom to buy the government.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.740]   And how terrible it would be
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.340]   to deny you the freedom to spend
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.520]   hundreds of millions of dollars on a campaign
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.580]   to elect the candidates.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.940]   And they said, that's your freedom,
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   and that's what Citizens United is about.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.780]   We've gotta end that.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.100]   In my view, we move to public funding of elections.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.460]   That means you wanna run for governing,
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.700]   you wanna run for Senate,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.980]   show that you have some support,
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.460]   get $5 contributions from X number of people
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.860]   to show you you're not a flake.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.020]   You have some support,
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.660]   and government will pay a certain amount more,
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.220]   and there will be a limited amount of money
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.060]   that can be spent.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.140]   So it'll be a real,
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.220]   you can run against me,
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.020]   and I'm not gonna outspend you 10 to one.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.660]   That's what we should be moving toward in my view.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.740]   - How do we make that happen
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.580]   when there's so much money in the system,
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.060]   and the politicians owe to the people
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.340]   who paid for their election?
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.700]   Does it have to come from the very top,
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.660]   essentially sort of a really strong,
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.900]   popular, populist president?
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.740]   - Well, you're right.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.900]   You raised exactly the question.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.180]   If I am getting a huge amount of money from billionaires,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.060]   do you think I'm gonna go out and announce,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.180]   I think billionaires should not be involved
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.060]   in buying elections.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.380]   I doubt that very much.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.320]   So what you're gonna need,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.300]   and you tell me if I'm missing something,
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.700]   but I pay attention,
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.740]   you don't hear either of the major candidates
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.420]   talking about that issue, do you?
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.140]   - I think what happens is,
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.980]   when an individual politician speaks out about it,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.940]   they get punished.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.180]   But I think this is a popular idea.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.620]   So if a lot of them speak out,
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.500]   that's why if it came from the top,
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.400]   if a president was using a very large platform
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.740]   to basically speak out,
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.420]   it provides a safety blanket for the other politicians
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.900]   to get it all out of the system.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.660]   But there has to be a kind of a mass movement.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.500]   - Yes, there does.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.220]   I mean, and every place I go,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.820]   I always speak about the issue.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.700]   And it always, people understand it.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.060]   You're a Republican, you're a Democrat,
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.080]   you're progressive, you're conservative.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.500]   Who really believes that we are a democracy
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.420]   when billionaires can spend tens and tens
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.700]   of millions of dollars to buy elections?
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.260]   So it is a very popular issue.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.260]   It's important, you're right.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.100]   We need political leaders to be speaking out on that.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.220]   But we need a grassroots movement to say,
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.580]   when somebody is at a town meeting,
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.780]   you're running for the Senate,
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.820]   you're running for the House,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.260]   what's your view on Citizens United?
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.700]   Are you prepared to vote to overturn that decision
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.780]   and move to public funding of elections?
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.900]   Extraordinarily important.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.140]   - So many of your policy proposals are quite radical.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.100]   - No, they're not.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.120]   I beg to differ.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.960]   - Okay, great.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.780]   - Go through.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.620]   (laughing)
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.980]   - Well, they're popular.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.740]   So what I mean is relative to what,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.720]   the way other politicians speak,
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.660]   it's usually a little bit more moderate.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.600]   So from everything you've learned from politics,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.120]   is it better to go sort of a radical,
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.920]   maybe we can come up with a different word,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.340]   versus a more moderate, safe, ambiguous kind of policy?
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.260]   - Let's talk about it, fair enough.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.860]   We talked about one issue, very important,
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.700]   money in politics.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.620]   - Money, yes.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.540]   - Getting money out of, big money out of politics.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.340]   Do you think that's a radical idea?
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.860]   - Well, I mean, yeah, it's a popular idea.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.700]   It's an idea that makes sense.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.820]   But in order to implement it and actually make it happen,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.340]   it requires, I mean, to flip the system upside down, right?
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.460]   In that sense, it's radical.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.900]   - In that sense, it's radical.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.180]   But if you go to walk down the street here and you say,
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.860]   "Do you think billionaires should be able to spend
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.480]   "as much money as they want to buy politicians?"
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.400]   I would say nine out of 10 people say, "That's crazy.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.360]   "That's not what America's supposed to be about."
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   So in that sense, it's certainly not radical.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.960]   Let's talk about healthcare.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.560]   I'd go out on the street, do it, or do a poll.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.960]   I've done the polling.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.680]   Is healthcare a human right?
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.160]   Should every American be able to go to a doctor
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.880]   when they need, regardless of their income?
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.000]   You know what people say?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.200]   I would say about 85, 90% of the people say, "Of course."
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.600]   The idea that healthcare is a human right
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   available to all exists, Lex, in every major country
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.940]   on earth except the United States.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.940]   So you're here with me in Burlington, Vermont, right?
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.020]   You got a car, go 50 miles north to Canada.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.800]   Walk a little Canadian, you know, walk into Canada
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.360]   and ask people, "When you go to the hospital,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.280]   "how much does it cost you?
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.120]   "Which kind of bill?"
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.980]   And they'll say, "What are you talking about?
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.900]   "It doesn't cost us anything.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.580]   "It doesn't cost us a nickel."
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.620]   That's the case in virtually every country in Europe.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:19.140]   So the idea that healthcare should be available to all,
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.500]   that there should be no out-of-pocket expense
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.980]   because it's a human right, is widespread around the world
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.980]   and very much agreed to in this country.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:36.020]   Bottom line is that because of our corrupt political system,
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.820]   we have a healthcare system designed
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.660]   not to provide healthcare to all people,
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.620]   to make huge profits for the drug companies
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.700]   and the insurance companies, and that is what's happening.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.540]   And we gotta change that system.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.060]   So I'm a strong advocate and I've led the effort
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.540]   on Medicare for All.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.500]   - Okay, let's talk about Medicare for All.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.980]   If you could snap your fingers today
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.780]   and implement the best possible healthcare system
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.860]   for the United States of America,
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.960]   what would that look like?
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.420]   - Well, we have a pretty good system, not great,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.780]   but a pretty good system in Medicare.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.380]   So it's there for the elderly, and Lyndon Johnson
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.900]   passed that in the 1960s, so huge step forward.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.980]   It is being chopped away by the private insurance companies
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.100]   through Medicare Advantage.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.980]   But if you strengthen Medicare and you do away
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.660]   with the kind of deductibles that seniors now have to pay,
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.860]   and you do away with other stuff,
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.300]   and you say basically, right now,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.240]   you're a senior in America, go to any doctor you want.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.340]   When you're in the hospital,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.920]   Medicare will pay the entire bill.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.540]   If you expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.540]   and vision, which it doesn't now cover,
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.980]   you do all of those things.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.420]   And then the next thing to do is say, okay,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.700]   to be eligible for Medicare, now you have to be 65.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.660]   First year, we're gonna lower it to 55,
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.820]   then we'll lower it to 45, then we'll lower it to 35,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.260]   then we'll have everybody in the system.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.780]   So I think in a four or five year period,
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.660]   you can strengthen Medicare and have everybody in the system.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.300]   And when you do that, and this is not just me talking,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.640]   a number of studies have pointed this out,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.100]   when you take the profit motive out of it,
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.400]   from the insurance companies and the drug companies,
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.000]   you can end up providing quality care to all people
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.520]   at no more than we're spending right now.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.120]   Because right now, we are spending twice as much
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.000]   per person in healthcare as the people of any other nation.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.840]   Incredibly wasteful system.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.520]   - So the way to pay for the system is to increase taxes,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.960]   but you're saying if you cut that cost
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.400]   and increase the taxes, you're saying it's going to--
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.160]   - Here's the story, and I've gotten my share
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.840]   of 30 second ads attacking me on this.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.940]   Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes on healthcare.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.760]   It's true, in a progressive way.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.120]   But right now, do you have health insurance?
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.320]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.280]   Somebody's paying for your health insurance.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.120]   It depends.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.640]   If you are working, most people get their health insurance
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.680]   through their jobs, okay?
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.360]   So if you're working for a large company,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.960]   your employer is paying your health insurance,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.000]   and by the way, that comes out of your wages.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.560]   Healthcare costs in America are very high,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.880]   and your employer will tell you honestly,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.000]   look, I can't give you more than a 3% wage increase
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.360]   'cause I got a 10% increase in your healthcare cost.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.280]   You want that?
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.340]   Or if you're a union negotiating,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.180]   you know what they'll say?
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.440]   Hey, you want decent wages?
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.940]   We're going to have to cut back on your healthcare.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.080]   That's what every union has to deal with
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.420]   every negotiating session.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.840]   So we're paying for it through employers out of pocket.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.720]   We pay through it through Medicare, Medicaid,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.940]   Veterans Administration, et cetera.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.080]   What I am proposing is really not radical.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.000]   It's what exists in Canada and other countries.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.760]   It is publicly funded like the police departments
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.040]   and like libraries are and like public education.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.960]   This is publicly funded in a progressive way.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.340]   So right now, rather than paying out of your own pocket,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.440]   if you are a family, let's just say
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.520]   you're self-employed right now,
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   and you are, you know, you have a couple of kids and a wife,
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.160]   it could cost you $15,000, $20,000 a year in insurance cost.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   Well, that's all eliminated.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.520]   Will you have to pay more in taxes?
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   Of course you will.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.080]   Maybe it depends on your income level,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.840]   but it could be that you'd be paying $12,000 more in taxes,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.760]   but not $20,000 more in premiums,
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.320]   copayments, and deductibles.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.520]   You save money.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.360]   So it's paying taxes rather than paying money
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.560]   to the insurance company.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.960]   You got a better deal through the tax system.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.720]   - So the most painful thing in today's system
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.560]   is the surprise bills, the number one cause of bankruptcy,
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.160]   and the psychological pain that comes from that,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.280]   just worrying, stressed, in debt.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.120]   - You got it.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.520]   - And just basically afraid constantly of getting sick
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.360]   because you don't know if insurance is gonna cover it,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.920]   and if you're not insured,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.800]   you don't know how much it's going to cost,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.080]   so you're not gonna go to the hospital
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.660]   even if there's something wrong with you,
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.960]   if there's pain and all that.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.480]   So you just live in a state of fear, psychological fear.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.660]   That's the number one problem.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.560]   It's not just financial, it's psychological.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.920]   - Look, and I think you said it very well.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.240]   I'm chairman of the committee that deals with this stuff,
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.800]   so I talk to a lot of doctors.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.000]   And doctors in Vermont and all over this country
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.520]   tell me that they are astounded.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.600]   People walk into their offices
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.260]   much sicker than they should have been.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.560]   And the doctor said, "Why didn't you come
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.760]   "six months ago when you first felt your symptoms?"
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.460]   And they said, "Well, I have a high deductible of it,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.320]   "$10,000 deductible, I don't have any money to pay.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.840]   "I'm uninsured."
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.360]   Some of those people don't make it.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.760]   Other people, and this is what is totally crazy.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.360]   They end up in the hospital at huge expense to the system
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.800]   rather than getting the care they need when they needed it.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   So that is how, I'll give you another example of it.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.380]   We pay the highest prices in the world
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.360]   for prescription drugs.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.000]   One out of four Americans can't afford
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.440]   the drugs their doctors prescribe.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.960]   So you walk into the doctor's office,
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.280]   and they say, "Okay, Lex, you got this, that,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.320]   "and the other thing, here's your prescription."
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.120]   You can't afford to fill it.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.580]   What happens? You get sicker.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.280]   You end up in the emergency room,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.600]   which is an extremely expensive proposition.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.880]   Or you end up in the hospital.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.120]   Rather than dealing with the problem when it occurs.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.880]   And what is not talked about, I mentioned earlier
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.080]   how we don't talk about some of the major issues.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.960]   The estimate is that some 60,000 people in America
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.440]   die every single year, unnecessarily,
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.860]   because they can't get to a doctor when they need
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.320]   because of financial reasons.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.620]   And you wanna hear it even crazier,
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.760]   one out of four people who get cancer treatment
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.760]   in this country either go bankrupt
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.240]   or deplete their financial resources or their family.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.480]   So your point is right.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.440]   If somebody diagnoses you with cancer,
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.880]   you're scared to death, you're worried about
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.160]   how you're gonna live, you're gonna die,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.000]   what's gonna happen?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.560]   And then on top of that, you gotta worry about
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.700]   whether your family goes bankrupt.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.840]   How insane and cruel is that?
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   So to me, I think healthcare is what unites us all.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.880]   Everybody has family, they get sick.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.980]   We'll get born, we all die, we all want care.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.980]   And we all have gotta come together
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.620]   to create a system that works for all of us,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.860]   not just the drug companies or the insurance companies.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.620]   - There's just so many stories.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.140]   And not even the horrific stories,
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.420]   there's countless horrific stories,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.340]   but just basic stories of cost.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.140]   Like my friend, Dr. Peter Atiyah has this story
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.140]   where he happens to be wealthy so he can afford it,
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.340]   but he had to take his son to the emergency room
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.780]   and the son was dehydrated and the bill was $6,000.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.840]   They just did a basic test and gave him an IV,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.200]   the basic thing, and he has really good insurance
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.680]   and the insurance covered $4,000 of it.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.080]   So he had to, at the end, pay $2,000
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.880]   for a basic emergency room visit.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.280]   And there's a lot of families for whom that one visit
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.200]   for such a simple thing would be just financially devastating
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.400]   - And you know what?
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.360]   People know that and you know what they say?
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.680]   I don't feel well today, something's wrong.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.040]   I ain't gonna go to that emergency room
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.260]   because I don't want a $6,000 bill.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.860]   And what happens, he had insurance
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.860]   that paid 2/3 of it, right?
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.700]   - Yes.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.520]   - So what happens if he didn't?
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.040]   What happens if he didn't have money?
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.380]   He'd be hounded by bill collectors
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.220]   for the rest of his life.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.820]   So it is a disgusting system, it is an inhumane system,
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.620]   but the insurance companies and the drug companies
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.180]   are very powerful and they make a lot
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.820]   of campaign contributions, have a lot of lobbyists
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.260]   and we are where we are.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.220]   But I think the American people
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.820]   want fundamental changes there.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.720]   - So that's another good example of a really popular idea
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.660]   that is not implemented because of the money in politics.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.980]   - That's a wonder.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.160]   And I'll tell you that, not only that,
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.620]   not only is it not implemented because of money,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.880]   it's not even discussed.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.900]   All right, so I'm saying here, and no one disputes me,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.200]   we are spending twice as much per person
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.300]   on healthcare, right?
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:51.280]   And yet 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.020]   and our life expectancy is lower
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.780]   than virtually every other major country on earth.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.100]   Do you think that might be an issue that we'd be discussing?
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.980]   - Again, if a single politician discusses it,
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.940]   they get punished for it.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.980]   So there needs to be a mass movement
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.500]   and probably, I mean, from my perspective,
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.580]   it has to come from the very top,
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.980]   it has to come from the president.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.940]   And the president has to be a populist president
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.820]   where they don't care about the parties
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.380]   with the rich people, they just speak out
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.900]   because they know it's a popular message
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.120]   and they know it's the right thing.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   So speaking of that, you had a historic campaign
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.800]   run for president in 2016.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:35.180]   And in the eyes of many people, mine included,
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.000]   you were screwed over by the DNC,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.620]   as especially the WikiLeaks emails showed.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.320]   What's your just looking back feelings about that?
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   Are you angry, are you upset?
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.840]   - Yeah, of course I'm angry and of course I'm upset.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.480]   But when you take on, in this case,
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.000]   the democratic establishment
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.320]   who have controlled that party forever,
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.600]   moneyed interest in the democratic party,
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.320]   you're taking on corporate America
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.060]   when you're taking on the corporate media.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.240]   And when you're calling for a political revolution
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.160]   that creates a government that works for all
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.760]   and not just the few,
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.180]   the opposition is going to be extraordinary.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.840]   But what I am extremely proud of
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.980]   from that campaign in 2020 as well,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.760]   is that we took on the anointed candidate
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.260]   of the establishment and we showed,
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.940]   you know, we showed, despite the fact,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.300]   the entire establishment.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.780]   I had in the Senate, I had one supporter.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.380]   There were 50 Democrats, I had one supporter.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.780]   I had no governor supporting me, I think.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.820]   Maybe a few people in the House.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.500]   But we took on the whole political establishment
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.700]   and we did, you know, got millions of votes
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.460]   and the ideas that we brought forth
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.700]   were ideas that they had to eventually
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.020]   deal with in one way or another.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.620]   And if you look at the American Rescue Plan,
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.980]   which I'm proud to have helped write
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.660]   during the midst of COVID,
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.220]   a lot of the ideas that we fought for
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.660]   were implemented in that bill
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.180]   and I want to make them obviously permanent.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.340]   - And you almost won.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.500]   And a lot of people thought
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.580]   that you would win against Donald Trump.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.700]   - I think we would have.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.800]   I think we would have.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.100]   You know, I think Trump is a very,
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.520]   you know, I think he's a little bit crazy
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.940]   between you and me, but he is a smart politician
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.340]   and he's appealing to a lot of the anger
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.520]   that working class people feel.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.360]   And you know what?
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.540]   Working class people should feel angry,
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.020]   but they should make sure that their anger
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.300]   is directed in the right direction
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.180]   and not against people who are even worse off than they are,
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.820]   which is what demagogues like Trump always do.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.380]   So, you know, I think we had,
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.820]   as I went around the country then and now,
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.420]   we have a lot of support from working class people
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.260]   who understand that there is something wrong.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.380]   And this is an incredible fact that no one talks about.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.460]   All right, I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.420]   Are you ready for this, Lex?
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.260]   - Let's go.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.360]   - Here we go.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.960]   Over the last 50 years,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.540]   there's been a massive increase in worker productivity
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.980]   as a result of technology, right?
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.020]   Everyone agrees with that.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.900]   And it's, I don't know exactly what it is,
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.660]   but the worker today is producing a lot more
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.220]   than the worker 50 years ago doing something similar.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.660]   Is the worker today, in real inflation accounted for dollars,
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.060]   making more money than that worker 50 years ago?
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.860]   - Well, there's a lot of close arguments there,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.100]   but your point is well taken.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.460]   It's either the same or a little bit higher
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.500]   or a little bit lower, depending on the statistics.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.100]   It has not increased significantly.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.220]   And the wealth inequality has increased significantly.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.060]   - That is the point.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.620]   - You would think that if a worker is producing a lot more,
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.380]   that worker would be better off,
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.140]   would be working lesser hours, et cetera.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.860]   That hasn't been the case.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.540]   And what has happened in that 50 years
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.860]   is according to the Rand Corporation,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.380]   there has been a 50 trillion, trillion with a T,
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.740]   redistribution of wealth from the bottom 90%
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.420]   to the top 1%.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.100]   So you got CEOs today making 300 times more
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.660]   than their workers.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.780]   You got three people on top owning more wealth
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.140]   than the bottom half of American society.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.640]   So that's why people are angry.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.820]   And they're worried that their kids
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.140]   may have a lower standard of living than they
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.580]   in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.340]   So there's a lot of anger out there.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.520]   And I think we tap some of that anger in a constructive way.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.380]   Essentially saying, you know what?
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.980]   We don't need so few to have so much in wealth and power.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.140]   Let's distribute it more fairly in America.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.980]   - I gotta get back to 2016
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.780]   'cause it's such a historic moment.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.640]   So there's a lot of fans of yours
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.260]   that wanted you to keep fighting
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.820]   because you forgave in the end the establishment
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.980]   and joined them in support.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.900]   And your fans wanted you to keep fighting
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.020]   for a takeover, for a progressive takeover
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.260]   of the Democratic Party.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.280]   If you just look back and had to do it all over again,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.620]   what would you do different?
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.140]   - Well, by the way, in terms of a takeover
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.180]   of the Democratic Party, we did try.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.660]   We ran, do you know who Keith Ellison is?
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.060]   Keith is now the attorney general
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:12.980]   of the state of Minnesota.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.180]   He's doing a great job, really.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.300]   One of the outstanding attorney generals in the country.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.840]   And Keith was then a member of Congress.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.420]   And we ran Keith to become the head of the DNC
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.500]   and the establishment
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.100]   from the president of the United States on down, went crazy.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.580]   And they beat him by a few votes, not a whole lot.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.980]   So it's, look, you're faced,
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.460]   and that's the exact same position
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.780]   that many of us are in right today.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.860]   So people say, well, why did you support Hillary Clinton?
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.420]   Yeah, what's the alternative, Donald Trump?
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.460]   I think Donald Trump is an extremely dangerous person
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.940]   trying to undermine American democracy.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.220]   So I can't support him.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.660]   Hillary Clinton, obviously,
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.460]   his views are very, very different than mine.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.340]   But in that moment,
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.140]   that's where politics becomes really tricky.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.820]   And it ain't easy.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.780]   And, you know, sometimes you have to do things
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.620]   that you're not really all that excited about.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.880]   But I think it was right to try to do what I could
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.940]   to prevent Trump from getting elected.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.420]   And in 2020, I did the same with Biden.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.940]   We had more success with Biden than we had with Clinton.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.980]   - Well, there's this interesting story
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.820]   about a long time coming meeting
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.980]   between you and Obama in 2018, I believe.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.940]   So Ari Rabenhoft, who was a former deputy campaign manager,
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.260]   wrote a great book, I would say, about you,
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.340]   called "The Fighting Soul on the Road with Bernie Sanders."
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.540]   And he tells many great stories,
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.860]   but one of them is your meeting with Obama.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.100]   And he says that Obama told you,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.900]   "Bernie," I wish I could do a good Obama impression,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.900]   (laughing)
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.980]   "Bernie, you're an Old Testament prophet,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.180]   "a moral voice for our party, giving us guidance.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.440]   "Here's the thing, though.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.600]   "Prophets don't get to be king.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.220]   "Kings have to make choices, prophets don't.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.940]   "Are you willing to make those choices?"
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.460]   Basically, Obama's making the case
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.380]   that you have to sort of moderate your approach
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.580]   in order to win.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.860]   So was Obama right?
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.300]   - Look, and again, that's why politics
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.100]   is very, very fascinating.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.020]   Sometimes you can run and lose and you really win
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.100]   if your goal is not just individual power,
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.620]   but transforming society.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.360]   - One of my heroes, you mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.240]   Who is one of my heroes?
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.680]   Another one of my heroes is Eugene Victor Debs.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.600]   That ring a bell?
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.920]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.760]   - Okay.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.880]   - For many reasons, yes.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.960]   - All right, Debs, many listeners may not know
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.560]   who Debs was.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.080]   Debs was a union organizer in the early 1900s,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.800]   helped form the American Railway Union,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.540]   ran for president I think five times,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.380]   ran the last time while he was in a jail cell
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.440]   because of his opposition to World War I
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.500]   and got a million votes doing that.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.100]   Debs lost badly in every race that he ran in.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.800]   1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran for president.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.640]   And much of what Roosevelt ended up doing
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   was at least some of what Debs had talked about.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.760]   Debs helped lay the groundwork for ideas.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.700]   So sometimes you can lose and win
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.280]   if you're into transforming society.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.320]   What my view is, where I disagree with Obama,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.720]   is I think you have got to raise consciousness
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.240]   among ordinary people.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.000]   And when people know what's going on
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.800]   and are prepared in an organized way to fight for change,
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.480]   they can make incredible changes.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.840]   And we've seen that in recent years.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.280]   You know, today we take for granted,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   we have a woman running for president of the United States,
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.180]   so I'm supporting.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.000]   We have had other women running for president.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.800]   We have women governors and senators.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.080]   Not so many years ago in the United States Senate,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.960]   there were 98 men, two women, all right?
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.080]   Even before that, 1920,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.160]   it was when women got the right to vote.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.520]   How did that change?
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.520]   How did women's role in society change?
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.800]   It changed because women and their male allies
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.760]   stood up and fought.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.720]   Gay rights.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.000]   I'm old enough to remember that anybody I knew who was gay,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.820]   you think they would talk about it?
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.660]   Come out about it?
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.480]   No, they wouldn't.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.320]   That's changed.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.160]   We have seen, you know, in terms of civil rights,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.220]   massive changes.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.560]   Change happens when people at the grassroots level demand it.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.160]   We talked about healthcare a moment ago.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.420]   We will get universal Medicare for all
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.920]   when millions of people make it clear
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.000]   that's what they want.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.640]   So I believe politics starts at the grassroots level,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.280]   and that's how you gotta bring about change.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.600]   - So just to go back to Obama, though,
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.200]   in many ways, he too is a singular historic figure
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.040]   in American politics who has brought about a lot of change.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.000]   He's a symbol I think that'll be remembered for a long time.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.080]   What do you admire most about Obama?
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.600]   - Well, you know, I know him.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.560]   We're not best friends, but I know him well,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.600]   and we chat every once in a while.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.960]   First of all, don't underestimate what it was
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.000]   in 2008 to be the first black president
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.560]   in the history of this country.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.420]   And I think fewer deny that he's an extraordinarily
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.400]   intelligent guy, very, very articulate,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.200]   one of the best speakers that there is in America,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.640]   and that he and his family, and again,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.960]   it's a lot harder than it looks.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.080]   He and his family, for eight years,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.920]   that's his wife, Michelle, and his kids,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   really held that office in a way that earned,
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.400]   I think, the respect of the American people,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.680]   even when people disagreed with him politically.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:52.760]   So he deserves, and again, don't ever underestimate.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.680]   I think years ago, there were people who said,
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.520]   "A black president in our lifetimes?
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.240]   "Never gonna happen, can't happen.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.520]   "Too racist a country."
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.320]   He did it, and that is a huge accomplishment.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:08.720]   And I think he has had some significant achievements
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.280]   in his presidential tenure.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   He and I did disagree on a number of issues.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.160]   I think he will tell you, I think his public stance
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.480]   is that, "Yeah, if you had to start all over again,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.820]   "he would do Medicare for all, single-payer,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.560]   "but where we are right now, the best he could do
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.720]   "is the Affordable Care Act."
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.640]   Well, we disagree on that,
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.960]   and we disagree on other things.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.240]   But I think he deserves an enormous amount of credit
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.640]   for what he has accomplished.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.920]   - And he, like you, also gave a damn good speech
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.240]   opposing the Iraq War before running for president,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.520]   and that takes courage.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.540]   - Yes, it does.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.320]   - But then it also shows that, once again,
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.400]   to office, it's not so easy to oppose
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.560]   or to work against the military-industrial complex.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.760]   - It is very hard.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.400]   People do not fully appreciate
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.280]   how powerful the establishment is,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.740]   whether it is the healthcare industry,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.420]   whether it's the military-industrial complex,
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.920]   whether it's the fossil-fuel industry.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.040]   These people have unlimited amounts of money,
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   they are very smart lobbyists in Washington, D.C.,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.720]   and they are very, very greedy people.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.560]   They want it all.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.440]   - I have to ask you about capitalism, the pros and cons.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.080]   So you wrote a book,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.360]   "It's Okay to be Angry About Capitalism,"
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.560]   that is a thorough, rigorous criticism
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   of, I would say, hyper-capitalism.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.400]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.600]   - A certain kind of capitalism that you argue
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.220]   that we are existing in today in the United States.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.960]   But a lot of people would attribute to capitalism
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.880]   all the amazing technological innovations
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.680]   over the past 70-plus years
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.920]   that have contributed to increase in quality of life,
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.760]   in GDP, in decrease in poverty,
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.480]   decrease in infant mortality,
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.680]   increase in expected life expectancy.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.440]   So how do you see the tension,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.060]   the pros of capitalism and the cons of capitalism?
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.060]   - Some of my European friends, they say,
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.620]   "Bernie, in the United States,
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.060]   "you're considered to be very radical.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   "If you were here in France or Denmark or someplace,
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.540]   "you'd be kind of mainstream left guy,
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.340]   "not all that radical."
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.680]   So this is what I think.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.720]   I mean, I think the best that we could do right now,
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.920]   where we are right now,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.960]   is to create a society which does two things.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.380]   It encourages innovation,
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.160]   but at the same time,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.600]   it makes sure that all people in a wealthy nation
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.320]   have a decent standard of living.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.560]   In some countries, if you look at Scandinavia,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.600]   and this shocks people
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.480]   'cause we don't talk about this at all.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.400]   So in Scandinavia, it has been the case,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   you know, Denmark, Finland, Norway,
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.520]   for years that people have healthcare.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.440]   That's not a big deal.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.780]   You end up in the hospital, so what?
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.880]   They don't pay a bill.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.220]   You have, and this shocks people.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.220]   In America right now, we have people who get one week,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.300]   two weeks off paid vacation.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.780]   Sometimes people get nothing, you know that?
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.120]   There are people out there who have no vacation at all.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.900]   You know, in Germany, you get six weeks paid vacation
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.700]   and other holidays as well.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.060]   People are shocked by that.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.620]   In America, we don't have paid family and medical leave.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.660]   The only major country not to do it.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.940]   You know, other countries, you know,
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.620]   your wife gets sick, you stay home with her.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.240]   Your kids get sick, not a big deal.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.720]   You get a certain amount of paid family and medical leave.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.160]   Cost of prescription drugs are far more affordable.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.600]   So what you wanna do
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.280]   is create what's called a social safety net.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.380]   That means, I don't care what your income is.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.800]   Of course, you're gonna have healthcare as a human right.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.580]   Of course, you're gonna have housing that is affordable.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.960]   Of course, your kids are gonna have
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.840]   great quality education from childcare to university
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.880]   without much cost.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.120]   You know, every country has a little bit different,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.900]   but there are countries in the world right now,
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.220]   I think in Germany,
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.560]   I think college is now tuition-free, as I recall,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.940]   for obvious reasons.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.100]   They want to have the best educated workforce they can.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.020]   So in terms of government playing a role
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.460]   in a civilized democratic society
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.620]   of providing all basic needs,
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:26.180]   healthcare, education, housing, retirement benefits,
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.940]   yes, that is what we've gotta do.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.320]   Now, does that mean then that the government
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.320]   is gonna run every mom-and-pop store on the corner?
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.400]   Of course not.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.000]   You want innovation.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.120]   You wanna go out and start a business,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.600]   produce a product, good luck to you, make money.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.400]   But on the other hand, in terms of even making money,
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.720]   we want you to be able to do that,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.360]   come up with good products, good services.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.400]   But do I think you should end up with $100 billion?
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.860]   No, I don't.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.700]   And you know what's funny?
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.080]   I did an interview with Bill Gates,
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.840]   who is, I think, the third wealthiest guy in the country,
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:04.200]   struggling behind Musk and Bezos, I think.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.840]   And he's only worth 100-plus billion, but he gets by.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   And I said to him, "Bill."
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.240]   He was supposed to ask me questions.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.080]   I asked him the question.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.420]   I said, "Bill, tell me something.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.680]   "You're an innovator with Microsoft and all that stuff.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.180]   "Did you know that you'd become a multi-billionaire
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.680]   "and was that what motivated you?"
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.720]   And he said, "No."
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.560]   And I believe he was honest.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.640]   He said, "I love doing what I do.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.480]   "I love programming."
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.320]   You know, he was a kid.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.140]   He started doing that.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.980]   He loved it.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.240]   He was motivated by it.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.720]   Do you think that there are scientists out there
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.520]   who work day and night trying to develop drugs
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.600]   to deal with Alzheimer's or cancer,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   that they motivate, "Oh, boy, if I come up with this drug,
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.240]   "I'm gonna become a billionaire"?
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.160]   So I think we want to reward success.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.080]   Fine.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.380]   But you don't need a billion dollars.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.280]   We want people to get satisfaction
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.500]   from what they accomplished, the work they're doing,
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.080]   whether it's cleaning the street
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.440]   or developing a new drug.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.480]   So I think we have gone a little bit too far,
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.960]   and you're right in talking about the book
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   was an attack on, I call it hyper-capitalism
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.300]   or uber-capitalism, but right now,
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.680]   and this is not an American issue,
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.000]   this is a global issue, you know,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.680]   it's not an accident that Musk is over there
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.720]   in Saudi Arabia talking to the, you know,
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.560]   trillionaire families in the Mideast.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.760]   These guys that were Putin and his friends.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   You got probably not more than, you know,
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.300]   five, 10,000 extraordinarily wealthy families
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.240]   who have unbelievable economic power,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.920]   over seven billion people on this planet.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.740]   - Well, Elon Musk is actually an interesting case
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.840]   because he's investing all the money back
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.300]   into the businesses.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.120]   So I think there is a balance to be struck,
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.160]   and you just spoke to it, which is we can still celebrate
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.000]   even big companies that are bringing wealth to the world,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.220]   that are building cool stuff,
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.860]   that are improving quality of life,
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.580]   but we can question of why is it that the working class
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.440]   does not have a living wage in many cases,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.400]   and sort of trying to find that balance.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.480]   - That's right, that is the, look,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.000]   I am no great fan of Elon Musk,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.640]   especially in the role that he's playing right now
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.000]   in Trump's campaign.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.960]   But is he a brilliant guy?
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.840]   Of course he is.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.920]   Does he work like a dog?
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.200]   Of course he does.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   Does he come up with these incredible innovations
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.040]   in companies?
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.860]   Yes, he does.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.700]   Does he deserve credit for that?
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.800]   Yeah, he does.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.000]   But, you know, even in terms of encouraging innovation,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.800]   I would hope that we are focusing on the important issues.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.240]   I would love to see great innovators figure out
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.440]   how we build the affordable housing that we need,
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.760]   come up with the great drugs that we need to solve
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.840]   many of the terrible illnesses that plague people,
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.720]   climate change, for God's sakes.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.080]   All right, do we need innovation?
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.680]   You know, we're making good, some progress in this country.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.520]   Should we do more?
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.160]   What kind of technologies out there
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.520]   can really cut back on carbon emissions?
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.360]   So, you know, I hope we focus
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   on some of the most important issues that impact humanity.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.800]   But, you know, reward innovators,
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.760]   I don't have a problem with that,
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.800]   but I do have a problem when three people
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.640]   end up owning more wealth
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.000]   than the bottom half of American society.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.560]   - Maybe you can briefly speak to something
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   you tweeted recently about Donald Trump
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.120]   going to McDonald's and the minimum wage,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.680]   I believe, of seven and a half dollars.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.920]   Can you just speak to that tweet?
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.160]   - Look, nothing new.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.240]   Trump didn't invent it.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.720]   That's, of course, a photo opportunity.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.640]   I don't want it to in my life, too.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.480]   So, you go to a place, he puts on an apron.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.220]   He, good old Donald Trump,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.160]   just another McDonald's worker.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.880]   But, anyhow, he was civilized.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.560]   He did his photo op, that's fine.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.040]   Kamala Harris was in North Carolina
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.840]   handing out food to people who were victims
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.600]   of the hurricane, fine.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.120]   That's what politicians do.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.680]   But some reporter asked him, they said,
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.600]   you know, Mr. Trump, are you for raising the minimum wage?
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.960]   And that was a fair question,
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.320]   because you got, I don't know how many,
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.320]   but many, many thousands of McDonald's workers
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.040]   and millions of other American workers right now
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.480]   are trying to get by on nine, 10, 11 bucks an hour.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.840]   Federal minimum wage is seven and a quarter.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   You have people working at McDonald's right now,
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.880]   for sure, who are working with 12, 13 bucks an hour.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.840]   So, the reporter said, you know,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.960]   what do you think about raising the federal minimum wage?
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.480]   And he's, oh, these are great workers.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.880]   I love McDonald's, so forth.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.500]   He didn't answer the question.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.760]   Well, I think that in the richest country
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.080]   in the history of the world,
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.520]   if you work 40 hours a week,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.080]   you should not be living in poverty.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.120]   And that means we should have a federal minimum wage,
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.600]   not absurdly seven and a quarter an hour,
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.160]   but in my view, $17 an hour.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.080]   Will that solve all the economic problems
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   for working class people?
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.920]   No, it won't.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.720]   It'll help, it'll help.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.040]   - Since running for president,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.640]   you've often been attacked, especially from the right,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.800]   about being worth, I believe, $2 million
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.680]   and owning three houses.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   So, from my perspective, the answer to that
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.520]   is most of your wealth has been earned
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.680]   from writing books and selling those books.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.040]   And you are one of the most famous politicians
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.840]   in the world, and so your wealth and the context
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.120]   in comparison to other people of that fame level
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.600]   and other politicians is actually quite modest.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.720]   So, what's your response, usually, to those attacks?
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.240]   - Do I own three residences?
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.140]   Yeah, I do.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.440]   I live here in Burlington, Vermont.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.000]   We live in a middle class neighborhood, nice house.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.320]   Guess what, I'm a United States senator,
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.840]   and I own a home in Washington, D.C.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.880]   as do most senators.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.600]   You know, you live there year after year.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.980]   When I first went to, actually, when I was in Congress
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.000]   for 16 years, I rented all the time.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.960]   But I got elected, okay, got a six-year term.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.120]   You know what, let's buy a house.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.760]   So, we bought a house, and guess what?
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.120]   Like many thousands of people in the state of Vermont,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.440]   I have a summer camp, it's a nice one, on Lake Champlain.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.580]   That's it.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.720]   Now, how did I get the money?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.800]   You're right.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.280]   I wrote two best-selling books,
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.200]   including this book on capitalism.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.120]   It was New York Times bestseller for a while.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.920]   And also another book was a youth book.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.600]   And that's, and I make, I don't know, 175,000 a year.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.880]   And that's more or less how I became
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.240]   the zillionaire that I am.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.080]   (laughing)
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.520]   - Well, I should also mention that sometimes
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.440]   the word "mansion" is used, and I think your residences
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.280]   are quite modest, at least from my perspective.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.080]   - Yeah, normal houses in Vermont.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.880]   And they're not, you know, they're middle-class houses,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.760]   very nice house.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.180]   - So, when you started in politics,
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.520]   I read you were worth $1,100.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.360]   - That much?
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.960]   - Yeah, that much, that's right.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.560]   Has the increase in wealth changed your ability
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.640]   to relate to the working class?
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.560]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.360]   And obviously growing up in a working-class family
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:30.600]   has been maybe the most singularly significant
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.400]   aspect of my politics.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.680]   It's, you know, I grew up without money
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.840]   in a family that lived in a rent-controlled apartment
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.100]   in Brooklyn, New York.
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.720]   So that has impacted me.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.560]   I'll tell you, I don't really give a damn about money.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.520]   I drive a car that's 11 years old, you know,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.440]   it's an old car.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.920]   And money, here's my jewelry, it's a solar watch.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.760]   - Nice.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.600]   - And my wedding ring, that's about it.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.280]   I don't have a Rolex watch, would not be interested in it.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.800]   But I'll tell you what has impacted me.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.920]   My wife, who also grew up in a working-class family,
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.080]   will tell you the same.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.800]   We don't worry.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.040]   You raised that issue, you know,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.160]   if we have to go to the doctor,
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.520]   if our kids have to go to the doctor, we go to the doctor.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.080]   I don't spend nights worrying.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.720]   I used to, there was a time I had to worry about
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.640]   how to pay my electric bill.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.200]   I don't worry about that anymore.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.760]   So what has happened, that stress,
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.680]   that economic stress of not worrying
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.160]   about a financial disaster, that's gone.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   And that is enormous.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.320]   I, you know, maybe as much or more
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.240]   than any other member of the Senate,
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.760]   work hard, not only for, but with working-class people.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.000]   I'm chairman of the Committee that Deals with Labor Issues.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.800]   We have been involved probably in dozens of strikes,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.160]   all over this country, I've been on picket lines.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.200]   So, you know, I do my best.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.160]   It's a very easy trap to fall into.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.360]   You can get separated from ordinary people
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.840]   and their struggles, not hard to do.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.440]   I try as hard as I can not to do that.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.680]   - So sometimes people say, "Can money buy happiness?"
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.680]   I think I agree with you, that worry,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.080]   sort of being able to fill up your car
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.040]   and not worry about how much it's going to cost,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.680]   or be able to get food for dinner
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.060]   and not worry about how much it's gonna cost.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.000]   Or even, you know, I've been poor most of my life,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.400]   but I've been very fortunate recently
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.280]   to have enough wealth to not worry about healthcare,
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.480]   to have insurance and be able to afford
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.040]   an emergency room visit.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.740]   And that worry is just such a giant lift
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.720]   off your shoulders.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.760]   - Lex, I think you said it very well.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.000]   I remember, even to, and I saw this change in myself.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.560]   When I used to go out and I'd do the grocery shop.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.800]   My wife does a lot of the cooking.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.960]   I do the grocery shop.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.880]   And I used to look at the prices of everything.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.840]   I do that less now.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.680]   You know, I said, "What the hell?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.500]   "So what?
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.440]   "It costs 50 cents more for this can of stuff, so what?"
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.720]   But that's a luxury you have
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.940]   when you don't have to worry about that.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.120]   And I don't have to worry about it.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.840]   But your point is, again, to me,
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   I don't like big fancy cars or big fancy homes.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.480]   Don't go on.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.520]   My wife will tell you we've not been on a real vacation
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.280]   for God knows how long, 'cause I work pretty hard.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.340]   But the major thing about having money,
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.080]   which is enormously important, is just what you said.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.240]   I don't have to worry.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.680]   If somebody in my family gets sick,
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.080]   I don't have to worry about that.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.600]   I don't have to worry about putting food on the table
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.520]   or paying the mortgage.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.920]   So that's what money has done.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.760]   - Okay, let me ask you about the future
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.800]   of the Democratic Party.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.520]   So one of the biggest impacts you've had
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.380]   is you've been the fuel, the catalyst
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.560]   for the increase of the Progressive Caucus,
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.160]   the progressive movement within the Democratic Party.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.320]   Do you think that is the future,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.180]   the progressives, even Democratic Socialist leaders
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.720]   will take over the party?
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.520]   - That is the most important question
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.960]   regarding, to my mind, American politics.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.000]   One of the successes that we've had,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.200]   and I'm proud to have played a role in this,
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.720]   is that if you go to the House of Representatives right now,
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.520]   you will see almost 100 members of the Progressive Caucus
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.120]   led very well by a woman from Washington,
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.960]   Pramila Jayapal, does a great job.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.040]   You know, it's people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.920]   and Ilhan Omar, and many others.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.720]   Many of them are young, often women, people of color,
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.880]   and many of them come from working class backgrounds.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.160]   So what we have been able to do in recent years,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.840]   elect a number of strong progressives
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.520]   who represent working families very, very effectively.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.920]   The struggle in the Democratic Party
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.740]   is between the corporate wing and the progressive wing.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.360]   And the corporate wing takes a whole lot of money,
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   sees its salvation in getting a whole lot of money
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   from wealthy individuals and large corporations,
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.080]   and is not very vigorous, in my view,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.900]   in representing the needs of working class people.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.180]   If they were, we would have health care for all,
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.820]   we would have a minimum wage that was a living wage,
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.880]   we would not have a housing crisis,
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.480]   we would not have a tax system
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.060]   in which billionaires pay an effective tax rate
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.280]   that is lower than a truck driver or a nurse.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.800]   So I think one of the reasons
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.440]   that Trump has had political success
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.760]   is not so much his ideas.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.500]   Most working class people don't think
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.080]   we should give tax breaks to billionaires,
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.920]   or worry about the size of Arnold Palmer's genitalia.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   But they are angry, people are angry.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.360]   And the Democrats have not responded
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.400]   effectively to that anger.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.240]   So the struggle that we are waging right now
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.480]   is the future of the Democratic Party.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.880]   Will it be a party of the working class
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.480]   and represent working class issues,
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.400]   whether you're black or white or Latino or Asian,
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.840]   or whatever you may be?
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.960]   Or will it be a corporately dominated party?
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.820]   That's the struggle we're in right now.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.020]   - Did you consider running in 2024?
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.220]   From my perspective, I would have loved it if you ran.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.700]   I think you would have had a great chance
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:00.620]   of winning not just the primary, but the presidency.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.900]   - I gave it about five minutes, though, to it.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.380]   And the reason was, we have a slogan,
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.640]   the progressive movement, it's not about me, it's about us.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.540]   And to have taken on Biden, who, in my view,
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.120]   on domestic issues, has been quite strong,
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.720]   would have really split the Democratic Party
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.160]   and laid the groundwork for an easy Trump victory.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.960]   And that I did not wanna see.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.440]   So sometimes in life, and I know that a lot
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.920]   of younger people don't agree with me,
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.780]   but you gotta make choices which are painful.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.260]   So I strongly supported Biden,
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.120]   because I liked his domestic record.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.940]   He's done some good things against a lot of opposition.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.740]   And I'm supporting Kamala right now.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.900]   But I'm doing my best to see that a dangerous guy
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.380]   like Donald Trump does not become president.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.180]   - And the hope for you is that there will be
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.380]   future candidates that are populist, that are progressive.
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.300]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.860]   - Let me ask you about AOC.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.300]   She's become one of the most influential voices
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.940]   for the progressive cause in the United States.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.040]   You two had a great conversation on your podcast,
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.980]   and in general, you worked together.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.180]   So what's, to you, is most impressive about her?
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.180]   - I really like Alexandria a whole lot.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:18.640]   She is a young woman who comes
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.660]   from a working class background.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.400]   She helped her mother clean houses.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.180]   She was a bartender in the Bronx, New York.
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:31.980]   And I'm very proud that my campaign
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.080]   for president inspired her to run.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:39.900]   And she ran on a progressive working class program.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.660]   And she took on one of the more powerful guys,
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.660]   a guy named Joe Crowley,
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.520]   who was pretty high up in the Democratic Party.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.860]   And she knocked on doors.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.580]   She had no money.
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.460]   She did a very strong grassroots effort.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.420]   And I appreciate that.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.300]   So that's number one.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.020]   I like what she stands for.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.700]   She's incredibly smart.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.180]   And she has that certain charisma
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.140]   that, you know, maybe you're born with it,
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.060]   maybe you develop it, I don't know.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.780]   She, a couple of years ago,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.340]   she came up here to Vermont at some time.
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:12.100]   She and her partner, Riley, came up.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.820]   And we were out in the street,
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.100]   and people saw her, and they said,
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.340]   "Oh, Congresswoman," and she just smiled.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.740]   And she had an approach to people which was beautiful.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.900]   I mean, it wasn't phony, it was real.
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.980]   But to be a politician, you gotta know how to,
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.500]   you know, you could be a great intellectual,
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.740]   but you can't relate to people.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.300]   She relates well to people.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:36.220]   And so I think both from a personality perspective,
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.020]   from an intellect perspective,
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.260]   from an ideological perspective,
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.860]   she helped create the Green New Deal concept,
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.940]   the need to create jobs as we transform
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.260]   our energy system away from fossil fuel,
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.700]   strong advocate for Medicare for all workers' rights.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.060]   So I'm a big fan of Alexandria.
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.780]   - What do you think is the most powerful,
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.700]   enduring impact you've had on American politics?
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.900]   Looking back, you've been in it for quite a bit.
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.620]   - Well, you know, I don't know that I can give you
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.300]   a singular answer, you know, I was mayor of this city,
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:07.500]   and proud of what we accomplished here.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.700]   Proud of my accomplishments as a U.S. Senator, you know.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.740]   When COVID was devastating this country,
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.460]   and we had a massive economic downturn,
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.620]   as chairman of the Budget Committee,
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.980]   I helped write the American Rescue Plan,
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.700]   which put a lot of money into people's pockets.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.900]   We cut childhood poverty by 40%,
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.580]   by providing a child tax credit.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.460]   We kept hospitals going, we kept colleges going,
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.420]   kept people from getting evicted,
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.940]   helped get public health out there,
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.540]   people getting the vaccines, you know, I'm proud of that.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:39.660]   But at the end of the day, I think what I have shown
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.340]   is that the ideas, this gets back to the early part
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:46.420]   of this conversation, the ideas that I am talking about
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:51.020]   are ideas that are widely supported, you know.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.300]   So when, you know, Donald Trump says,
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.660]   "Oh, Bernie Sanders is a far left!"
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.300]   You know, it's like I'm some kind of extremist
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.900]   coming up with ideas that nobody supports.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.980]   Everything that I talk about,
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.340]   raising the minimum wage, healthcare for all,
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.340]   a tax system which demands the billionaires
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.180]   pay their fair share, those are all popular ideas,
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.460]   but people didn't know.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.220]   You gotta run for president and have 20,000 people
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.780]   come out to your rallies and win 23 states,
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:17.300]   and they say, "Hmm, well, maybe those ideas
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.020]   "are not so crazy after all."
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.580]   And we gotta entertain 'em.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.580]   The establishment doesn't like that.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.420]   They really don't.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.620]   They wanna tell you, and this is their main,
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.140]   this is how they succeed.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.460]   What they say, Lex, is the world is the way it is.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.220]   It always will be this way.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.340]   We got the wealth, we got the power,
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.660]   and don't think of anything else.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.660]   This is the way it is.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.420]   You have no power, give up.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:40.660]   They don't say it quite that way,
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.720]   but that's really what the intent is.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.420]   And what we showed is, guess what?
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:50.220]   You know, running an outsider campaign,
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.820]   we took on the Democratic establishment,
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:55.720]   we came close to winning it, and we did win 23 states,
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.000]   and the ideas that we're talking about
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.360]   are the ideas that working-class people,
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.720]   young people, believe in.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.620]   - Yeah, you showed that it's possible to win,
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.100]   and that's an idea that will resonate for decades to come.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.820]   - And out of that came dozens of candidates
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:10.480]   now in the House of Representatives,
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.760]   people on city council, people on state legislature,
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.080]   who did win.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.500]   - So we mentioned about the worry of getting sick,
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.800]   the worry of life that many people
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.680]   in the working class are suffering from,
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:26.920]   but there's also the worry that we all experience
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.760]   of the finiteness of life.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.560]   Do you ponder your own mortality?
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.400]   Are you afraid of it?
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.840]   - Well, when you're 83, it does come across.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.240]   - All right.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.920]   - Yeah, of course I do.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.800]   - Are you afraid of it?
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.820]   - No, I'm not afraid of death.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.520]   What I am afraid of, I think, is infirmity.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.480]   I have been, knock on wood, this is wood, I think,
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.160]   reasonably healthy, with an exception.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.840]   I had a heart attack five years ago.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.080]   And what blew me away was that my body failed me
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.300]   for the very first time in my life.
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.160]   That was stunning to me,
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.380]   that suddenly I was in a hospital bed.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:05.280]   I have a great deal of compassion for people,
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.500]   as we speak, who are in nursing homes,
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.920]   having a hard time walking,
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.280]   maybe your mental agility is slipping a little bit.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.200]   That's tough, that's what worries me.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.080]   We're all gonna die, and that's that.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.000]   So I'm not afraid of that.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.560]   But that aspect of getting older,
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.800]   and that does concern me.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   - That said, your mind is as sharp
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.720]   as any politician that I've ever heard.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.640]   And also, just off-mic, I should say,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.440]   just the warmth that you radiate,
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.120]   and I deeply, deeply appreciate that.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.360]   - Well, thank you. - Just as a human being.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.960]   So you still got it, after all that,
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.720]   after all those speeches,
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.880]   after all those houses,
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.400]   after all of it, there's still the humility
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.900]   and just the sharpness, the wit is all there.
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.000]   So Bernie, yeah, like I said,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.880]   I wish you would've ran this year,
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.180]   but I also wish that there's future candidates.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.200]   - Yeah, and there will be, Lex.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.560]   I absolutely do, and I think,
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.440]   you know, you asked about my legacy,
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.240]   the idea that they're all wonderful,
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.120]   really, really wonderful people
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.800]   who are now got involved in the political process
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.920]   that are fighting for justice.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.480]   That's a great legacy.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.720]   - What gives you hope about the future of this country,
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.480]   about the future of the world?
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.120]   - You know, sometimes one can become very cynical.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.020]   You look at the terrible wars that are going on right now.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.120]   You look at the divisiveness in this country,
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.480]   the ugliness, the poverty.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.920]   You look at climate change.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.800]   You know, you can get depressed from all of that,
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.440]   but I am lucky in this sense,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.920]   in that I've had the opportunity.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.400]   People often ask, "What inspires you?
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.960]   "How do you keep going?"
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.680]   And I remember, it actually was in California
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.280]   where it really crystallized for me.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.360]   I was at a rally in the agricultural area of California,
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.120]   and we did a rally, and it was sunset.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.600]   Thousands of people were out,
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.680]   and you looked around the crowd,
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.600]   and there were young people, black and white and Latino
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.820]   and Asian American, huge cross-section.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.720]   They're older people, and they all wanted
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.880]   to make America a very much better country.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.280]   And it really moved, I mean, I see that time
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.480]   and time again, I've just been on the campaign trail,
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.840]   and you see great people, really beautiful people
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.480]   who are not interested in becoming billionaires.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.560]   They want to improve life for other people in this country.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.440]   So, you know, I am grateful that I, you know,
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.640]   it sounds like a platitude, you know,
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.240]   it's what every politician says, "Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.280]   But when you go out around the country, you know,
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.200]   you go to Native American reservations,
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.440]   and you go to factories and everything,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.400]   and you see so many wonderful people.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.160]   You know, I have been able to see things
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.000]   that many others have not,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.040]   I've been to every state in the country.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.320]   And that inspires me.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.080]   - I share their optimism, I share your optimism.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.340]   Bernie, I've been a fan for a long time.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.040]   It's a great honor to speak to you today.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:02.880]   Thank you so much.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.200]   - Well, thank you very much for what you're doing.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200]   Let me just say a word about what you're doing.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.040]   - Okay, let's go.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.320]   - Apparently, the compliments here.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   You know, I think there is a growing dissatisfaction
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.160]   with corporate media.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.880]   And not because it's fake news,
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.120]   or the reporters lie all the time, that's nonsense.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.520]   They don't.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.840]   But I think people want to hear folks really talk about,
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.960]   in a calm manner, about some of the very important issues
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.320]   which are not discussed in corporate media.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.960]   And I think that's what you and some others are doing.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.160]   So I thank you very much.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.280]   It's a very important service to the country.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.560]   - And thank you from a mayor perspective
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.400]   of creating a wonderful town.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.680]   And I look forward to looking at the fall leaves
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.520]   walking around tonight.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.720]   - Well, I didn't quite create the leaves.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.560]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.440]   - I did create some other things.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.760]   - Okay, thank you so much, Bernie.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.320]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.880]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.200]   with Bernie Sanders.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.480]   To support this podcast,
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.400]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.440]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Aristotle.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.480]   "The real difference between democracy and oligarchy
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.240]   "is poverty and wealth.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.460]   "Wherever men rule by reason of their wealth,
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:15.260]   "whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.160]   "And where the poor rule, that is democracy."
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.000]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
