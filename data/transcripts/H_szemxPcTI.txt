[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   There are no right answers for anything involved in art.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.480]   We're all trying experiments to find a way.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.320]   And even for the things that I work on,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.400]   I don't have a set way that I do anything.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.920]   Every, I come to every project blank.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.200]   - Maybe you're just a meat vehicle
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.560]   and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.320]   - I believe we know close to nothing,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.480]   close to nothing about anything.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.760]   If we embrace that not knowing,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.800]   we'll have a healthier experience going through life.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.840]   - The following is a conversation with Rick Rubin,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.280]   one of the greatest music producers of all time,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.600]   known for bringing the best out of anyone he works with,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.040]   no matter the genre of music or even the medium of art,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.480]   or just the medium of creating something beautiful
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.920]   in this world.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.560]   And the list of musicians he produced includes many, many,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.720]   many of the greats over the past 40 years,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   including the Beastie Boys, Eminem, Metallica,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.600]   LL Cool J, Kanye West, Slayer, Tom Petty,
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Aerosmith, Adele,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers, System of a Down,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.640]   Jay-Z, Black Sabbath.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480]   I can keep going for a very long time here.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.560]   Most importantly, Rick is just an amazing human being.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.800]   We became fast friends, which is surreal to say,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.600]   and is just an incredible honor.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   I felt truly heard as a person when I spent the day with him
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.360]   eating some delicious Texas barbecue,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   talking about life, about music, about art, about beauty.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   This was a conversation and experience I'll never forget.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.280]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.480]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   in the description.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Rick Rubin.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.680]   Are you nervous?
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   - I'm not shaky, but I would say I feel uneasy.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.640]   And I feel like the sooner we start talking,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.360]   the more relaxed we'll get.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.240]   - Yeah.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.960]   Well, maybe we should sit in this moment
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.880]   and enjoy the nervousness of it.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.760]   Let me start with Nietzsche.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.960]   He said, "Without music, life would be a mistake."
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720]   What do you think he means by that?
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000]   Let's talk some philosophy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.360]   Let's try to analyze Friedrich Nietzsche from a century ago.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.520]   - It seems like music has the ability to bring us
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   so much depth in our soul
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.760]   that's hard to access any other way.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.200]   And without it, there would be a loss
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.640]   beyond the pleasure of it.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.200]   Feels like it's a window into something else.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.880]   - Something that no other medium
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.040]   can express quite the same way.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.120]   - I would say not as automatically.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   Something about music can do it automatically.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   Maybe poetry or maybe certain abstract forms
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.720]   can get us there.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.920]   But there's something about music
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.440]   that really can get us there quickly.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.040]   - But it's also the time, the place, the history.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.000]   There's something about,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.440]   like a lot of my family's still in Philly,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.640]   there's something about driving through Jersey
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.880]   and listening to Bruce Springsteen.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.920]   And then it just, I'll get like emotional.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.000]   Like listening to "I'm On Fire."
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.880]   That like, one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.760]   there's a haunting kind of strumming to it.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   It's not a strumming, it's actually picked.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.160]   Has a country feel to it,
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.200]   almost like a Johnny Cash feel actually.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.640]   And it, I don't know, makes me feel,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.080]   so for people who don't know "I'm On Fire,"
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   that song is, I guess, a love song to a woman
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.920]   that you can't have because she's married
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.800]   or she's with somebody else,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.360]   which I guess is quite a lot of love songs.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.520]   But there's something about the haunting nature
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.960]   of the guitar and then it has to be driving through Jersey.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.040]   And I feel like everyone has fallen in love
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   with a Jersey girl at one point in their life.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.040]   I don't know if that's true for everybody.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.440]   But I feel like that.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.640]   I haven't either, but I just feel like that.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.960]   There's something about Bruce Springsteen's like,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   "Yeah, I've been there."
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.680]   And that just takes you to a place of emotion
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.320]   that you just, that captures love,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.880]   that captures longing, that captures the heartbreak
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.440]   of just the way time flows in life
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.560]   and the fact that it's finite
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.520]   and just all of that in a single, simple song.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.240]   What else can capture that?
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.720]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.920]   But it's true that there's a connection
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.840]   both between time and place and music.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.000]   Certain music growing up on the East Coast
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.280]   didn't really resonate with me
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.200]   until I spent time on the West Coast.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.680]   Eagles being an example.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.200]   When I lived in New York,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.840]   the Eagles didn't really speak to me.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.400]   ZZ Top didn't really speak to me.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.640]   And then when I started spending time in California
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.840]   and driving through Laurel Canyon,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.360]   all of a sudden the music of the Eagles
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.880]   felt appropriate somehow.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.840]   And I started listening to it more.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.680]   - Got it.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.080]   So not until you went out West
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.520]   can you understand the sounds of the West.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.600]   So it's really like New York has a sound.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.760]   What other places have a sound in the United States?
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   - I think every place does.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.360]   And that said, sometimes we can get an experience
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.800]   through music of a place,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.520]   like we can resonate with the music and not understand why.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.800]   And then maybe when we go to the place where it was created,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   it's almost like we have a knowingness of that place.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's not a strange place anymore.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.960]   - Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan with blues and Texas blues.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.640]   You can just listen to Texas Flood and just,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.680]   again, there's like a woman you're missing, a broken heart,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.200]   and somehow that connects you to the place.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.400]   The Eagles, what song with the Eagles connects with you?
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.520]   Are we talking about like "Take It Easy"
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.440]   or are we talking more like "Hotel California"?
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.240]   - I'm thinking "Take It Easy," but both are great.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.760]   - Yeah, there's certain songs
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.000]   when I started learning guitar when I was young
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.480]   that's like, I would like to be the kind of person
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.920]   that not only knows how to play this song,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.960]   but understands this song.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   And like have that song be something I played 20 years ago.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.680]   And I've lived with that song for a while.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.320]   Like "Hotel California" is an example.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.480]   Obviously there's the solo,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.360]   but there's also the soulfulness of the lyrics,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.760]   which I still don't understand.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.920]   And it could be about anything.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.800]   And as you get older,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.080]   I feel like the meaning of the song could be anything.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.720]   - Yeah, I think that's true.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think that's the beauty of them.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.240]   I think when the person wrote them,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   they may have had one interpretation,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.400]   but it's not contingent on us getting that interpretation
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.800]   to like it or resonate with it or feel it.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.680]   In some ways, the best art is open enough
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.640]   where the artist gets to have their experience
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.480]   when they make it.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   And then the audience gets to have their experience
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.880]   when they listen and they don't have to be the same.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.360]   - And then it connects thousands
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.960]   or millions of people together.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.160]   There's a togetherness of music when you share that music,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.800]   when you're listening to stuff together, like in a car.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.720]   First of all, the car is a sacred place.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   So I work in part on autonomous vehicles.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.800]   And you start to think, well, what are the things you lose
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.200]   when the car stops being the central part of American life?
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.920]   The car ownership.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.800]   It just feels like the car, when you're alone,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.120]   it's like a therapist thing, session,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.240]   because you get angry at other humans,
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.040]   you get to, and then you get to like sit
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.560]   in your own anger and emotion.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.320]   You get to listen to the song on a long road trip
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.000]   and remember, like run through your memories,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.320]   the heartbreak, I don't know, the one that got away,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.480]   but also like the beautiful moments, all of it.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.000]   And all of that in the car. (laughs)
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.840]   - Yeah, driving also serves another purpose.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.240]   And it's one of the things that we can do
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   that we have to pay attention enough,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.320]   not to crash, but typically can essentially run
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.680]   on autopilot enough where we could be thinking
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.560]   about something else or concentrating on something else.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.480]   And the difference between concentrating on something
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.560]   or trying to solve a problem,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.600]   when you're solely trying to solve a problem
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.640]   versus when you have some little task
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.960]   that's keeping you occupied,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   I find if I have something slight to take care of,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   it frees a more creative side of my mind
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.520]   to better solve problems.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.200]   - You know, I'm kind of jealous of people
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.700]   that found that in painting, for example.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.680]   They'll be drawing or painting and listening to,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.080]   so that's the small task you do.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.400]   You're coloring in the lines.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.600]   It's like this gentle, peaceful, slow process
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.760]   that requires just a small fraction of your mind
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.780]   and then you can listen.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.980]   Some people listen to podcasts that way.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.120]   Some people listen to music that way.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.980]   - How do you do it?
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.980]   How do you free your mind?
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:49.020]   - Running is one of them.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.000]   There's a process.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.660]   So most freeing of the mind for me has to go
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.360]   through a process of a bit of pain for a bit.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.980]   So doing something difficult,
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.920]   it's just like a airplane taking off or something.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.060]   So I have to, like for example, running,
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.220]   the first few miles would just be just,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.700]   first of all, the physical aspect,
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.180]   which is like, ah, you're so fat, you're out of shape,
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.060]   you're, this is, this is, getting old, this, that.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.060]   Okay, that slowly dissipates.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.600]   And then the demons come in who are like,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.040]   you should be getting this and that and this done.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.400]   You haven't gotten it done.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.580]   You're like breaking promises,
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.000]   all those kinds of voices coming in.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And after that, maybe mile four, it's like, fuck it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.900]   You just, you just run, run with the wind
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.700]   at a very slow pace, but with the wind,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.940]   and then, and then you could think.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.940]   So it's the footsteps, the physical activity,
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.640]   then you could deeply think about stuff, ideas,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.000]   sort of design, whether it's program design stuff
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.360]   or like high level life decisions,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.280]   all those kinds of things.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.480]   I would say running.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.620]   I used to build bridges from toothpicks.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.800]   It used to be a thing.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.520]   It's an engineering, I guess some people like
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.120]   glue together airplanes and stuff like that.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.560]   But the bridges, it's such deeply honest work
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.020]   because at the end of it,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.420]   you're gonna have to test that bridge.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.140]   And you're gonna see how good your work was,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.700]   the little details, but also the big picture.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.760]   - Do you use glue or no?
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.800]   - Yeah, I use glue.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.200]   So it's not pure physics.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.780]   It's materials engineering too.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.280]   'Cause the way you want to do it is
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.740]   you actually split the wood as thin as possible
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.980]   and then glue it back together
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.900]   'cause the glue is really strong,
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.060]   except for the arches and things like that.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.740]   So you're building arch bridges,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.300]   which is a whole nother skill
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.460]   'cause you have to bend the wood.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.340]   And it's so cool 'cause the thing can hold
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.860]   thousands of times its weight.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.720]   And then you get to watch it explode
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.560]   at a certain point from the pressure.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.420]   And when you do a really good job,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.620]   it doesn't explode in a kind of some weak point
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.680]   that you didn't anticipate,
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   just kind of starts cracking.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.260]   Everything cracks, everything explodes.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.420]   It's just pieces fly everywhere.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.520]   And it's literally hundreds of hours of work
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.580]   just explode in front of you.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.400]   And that's a metaphor for life maybe.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.700]   And it's all for nothing.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.940]   (laughs)
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.960]   Except for the journey that you took to get there.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.580]   And no one understands.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.660]   Speaking of which, back to Nietzsche.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.280]   These questions are ridiculous.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.020]   So you're gonna have to try to figure out
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.380]   what the heck I'm trying to do here.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.700]   So Nietzsche also said,
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.260]   a line I love, which is,
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.000]   and those who were seen dancing
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.740]   were thought to be insane by those
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.280]   who could not hear the music.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.460]   Do you, Rick Rubin, ever feel crazy?
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.860]   Or maybe you're the one who's sane
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.260]   and everybody else is crazy.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.900]   You know that the dancing, the joy of the music,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.940]   of just feeling the music
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.820]   and everybody else just doesn't understand.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.680]   And this doesn't have to be literally about music.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.420]   This is about art, about creation.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.940]   - I would say I feel different.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.400]   And it's hard to say, it's like,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.600]   which side of the equation is crazy, you know?
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.100]   - Did you ever find a group of people
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.180]   that you get, they get you?
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.020]   - Yes.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.120]   - Is that what producing is essentially?
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.480]   Is you try to find the moments
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.560]   when you just get each other?
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.400]   - No.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.740]   I would say they're definitely,
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:58.420]   certain artists with certain temperaments,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.580]   when you're around them,
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.380]   it feels like you can finish each other's sentences,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.860]   you know, just see the world the same way.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.140]   Comedians as well.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:12.940]   - And that's not essential for the two of you together
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.740]   creating something special?
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.140]   - No, no.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.180]   - So it could be attention too?
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.800]   - It could be anything, it could be any,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.540]   there's no rules.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.220]   It'd be like, think of it like a coach.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.220]   A coach could bring what they have to bring
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.700]   to any talented individual
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.640]   and help them find their way.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.460]   And sometimes it's the right,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.160]   the right coach for the right athlete really works.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.100]   And other times there's a mismatch.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.660]   - Have you seen the movie "Whiplash"?
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.500]   - I did.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.220]   - When it came out, so I don't really remember it well,
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.060]   but I did see it.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.340]   - So there's a coach type of figure
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.100]   who is pushing a drummer to create,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.220]   to grow as a musician,
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.140]   but also to create something special.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.260]   I don't know if it's even special music skill wise,
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.060]   it's a special moment.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.020]   I don't know what he's trying to create.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.140]   From one perspective, it's just an abusive,
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.240]   a person who selfishly gets off on being abusive
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.660]   to those he's with.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.660]   But from another perspective, the way I saw that movie,
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.340]   it's just the two right humans finding each other
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.740]   at the right moment in life
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.340]   and risking destroying each other in the process,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.700]   but maybe something beautiful will come of it.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.940]   Do you think that's a toxic relationship?
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.620]   Or is there, does some of that movie resonate with you
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.640]   as that sometimes is required to create art?
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.700]   That kind of suffering.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.940]   - Yeah, it doesn't.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.140]   Well, there's suffering involved,
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.700]   but not that kind of suffering.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.620]   Not for me.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.180]   There are some people who that's their process
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.300]   and that's whatever works.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.980]   There's no right answers for anything involved in art.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.380]   We're all trying experiments to find a way.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.220]   And even for the things that I work on,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.420]   I don't have a set way that I do anything.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   I come to every project blank
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.420]   and see, I really listen to what the artist plays and says.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:23.980]   And through what they explain they wanna do,
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:29.380]   help find the best way to get there.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.940]   Was it implicit in the movie
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.940]   that the mean teacher liked being a mean teacher?
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.740]   You said the way you described it
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.340]   was that he got off on treating people this way.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.540]   Do we know that to be the case?
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.820]   I don't remember that in the movie.
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.900]   - But we sometimes project that onto people,
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.180]   people who are really rough on students.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.080]   You start to think, well, maybe,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:01.020]   maybe that is fundamentally who they are.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.460]   And if it's fundamentally who they are,
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.180]   that there must be some pleasure in it
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.460]   or it's an addiction of some sort.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.460]   But it could be also a deliberate choice made by the teacher.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.380]   - It also could be a lineage.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.980]   Like in the Zen tradition,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.980]   there are sort of the mean Roshis,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.360]   who if you do something wrong, take a physical action.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.740]   And it's just in the lineage,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.180]   it's considered that's how you teach.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.540]   I didn't come from that lineage.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.740]   So I'm much more of a,
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.020]   I feel like it's more of a collaboration
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.540]   between people working together to make the best thing.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.500]   It's not a boss-slave relationship at all.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.980]   It's much more of a, let's find our way.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.700]   And we agree at the beginning of the process
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.140]   that if either of us or any of us
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.420]   don't like what's happening, we say it.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.740]   And the goal is to keep working
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.420]   until we get to a point where we're all really happy with it.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.980]   It's like if we make something
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.060]   that an artist likes and I don't like,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.780]   or that I like and they don't like,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.220]   we haven't gone far enough.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.020]   - In terms of lineage,
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.220]   the ones that seek destruction
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.500]   and the ones that seek happiness
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.720]   all come from the same lineage.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.740]   Well, it came from fish.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.460]   So somewhere in you, deep down,
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.340]   there's the other stuff too.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.780]   It's just that you haven't been yet, by the way,
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.260]   'cause you said every new project,
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.200]   including maybe starting today,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.780]   is an opportunity to channel, to plug into something
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.860]   that was always there
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.060]   and you haven't gotten a chance to plug into.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.380]   You mentioned listening.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.580]   How do you listen to a person?
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.420]   How do you hear a person?
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.500]   When you first come in, like we just met,
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.700]   what's the analysis happening?
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.780]   But I mean, with me is one thing.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.940]   I'm an artist of sorts.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.980]   I program and I'm just, I'm human, I guess.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.660]   We're all creating art.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.660]   How do you see, like, how do I bring out?
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.640]   So for people who don't know,
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.500]   I mean, obviously everyone knows
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.020]   that you've produced some of the greatest records ever,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   but the way I see that is you just brought out the best
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.520]   in a lot of interesting artists.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.900]   And so in order to bring out the best
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.580]   in them, you have to understand them.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.140]   You have to hear the music of their soul,
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.820]   hopefully I'm not being too romantic here,
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.220]   but just like, is there something you can say
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.620]   of how difficult that is, if there's a process,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.820]   if there's tricks, if it's luck?
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.260]   - I think it starts with this, again, coming in blank,
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.460]   like not having any preconceived ideas,
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.860]   being open and really listening,
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.980]   listening and not thinking about what you're gonna say next
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.940]   or what your opinion is or any,
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:14.060]   basically being a recorder and just hearing what comes in.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.180]   And then once you hear what comes in,
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.180]   processing that information and trying our best to do that
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.780]   without any of the beliefs that we might have
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.700]   to impact what that is.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.980]   If I ask you a question, I don't wanna hear what,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.460]   I don't wanna listen to you and have any reaction happening
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.980]   when you're speaking.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.100]   I wanna be as neutral as possible.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   For me, my goal is not to form an opinion,
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.900]   it's to understand.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.460]   So if anything, I would draw you out further
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.940]   and just ask questions to really understand.
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.940]   - And if you say something that somehow triggers me
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:08.300]   in a way that I wonder how he came to that,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.420]   I wouldn't challenge you, I would ask,
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.700]   how did you find that?
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.900]   How did you get to that place?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.380]   - Form a place of curiosity.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.340]   You would try to figure out--
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.380]   - Yeah, I wanna understand who the person is
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.660]   and through questioning, we can usually get there
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.180]   or through just spending time together,
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.260]   you find out who the person is.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.740]   - What about finding out and figuring out
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.500]   how to then take the next steps
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.060]   of bringing out the best in them?
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.260]   Is it just trial and error?
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.260]   Let's try this.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.820]   - It's definitely trial and error.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.220]   It's always trial and error.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.060]   - Are you afraid of making a mistake?
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.380]   Let's add this instrument, let's remove this instrument.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.580]   - Let's try. - Let's add this line,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.500]   let's remove this line.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.340]   - Let's try.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.340]   And let's be open.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.820]   So one of the, we don't really have rules,
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.140]   but one of the agreements in the studio
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.340]   is any idea that anyone has,
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.620]   we'll always demonstrate it, we'll always try it
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.940]   because I can describe to you an idea
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.460]   and you can think that's a terrible idea,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.340]   let's not do that.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.020]   And then I can play you the idea
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.540]   and then you can say, oh, that's really good.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.020]   And it's completely different because we,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.060]   when we're told something,
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.820]   we have to imagine what that is.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.940]   And the way you see something and imagine it
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.300]   and the way I see something and imagine it
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.500]   are completely different.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.420]   - So you say a thing and now there's two humans
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.220]   that play that thing in their mind differently,
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.740]   in their imagination,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.060]   and then there's a cool creative step
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.620]   and when you actually do it,
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.660]   to see how it differs in the imagination,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.220]   and then the difference or the commonality
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.060]   will be like an exciting little discovery together.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:57.180]   - So many groups of people making things together in a room,
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.220]   one person will suggest something
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.060]   and someone else in the room say,
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.780]   "Ah, that doesn't sound like a good idea,
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.620]   let's not do that."
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.580]   And then they move on.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.780]   The testing of every idea is really important
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.740]   and that's how you get to see,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.620]   oh, that's not at all what I thought it was gonna be.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.420]   Happens to me all the time, I know,
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.620]   because someone will suggest,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.780]   why don't we do it like this?
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.740]   And I'll think, that sounds bad.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.260]   And then I'll think, okay, let's try it.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.540]   And then we hear it and then eight times out of 10,
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.660]   it's nothing like I imagined and great.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.540]   - And you try not to have an ego about the fact
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.500]   that you thought it was not a good idea in your head.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.980]   - There can't be any ego in this.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:43.900]   If everyone's there with the purpose
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.780]   of making the best thing we can,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.260]   there's nothing else.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.020]   There can't be any boundaries to that.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.060]   - So there's a moment I saw with,
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.420]   I know you don't love talking about
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.940]   previous things you've done,
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.860]   but it's cool to dive in there.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.100]   - I'm fine to talk to maybe.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.940]   - To sample it.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.940]   Anything?
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.100]   Well, I have this pain I gotta talk now.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.540]   I'll think of something ridiculous
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.920]   that would make you change your mind.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.860]   You mentioned, I saw a video of you with Jay-Z
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.420]   and working on 99 Problems where you suggested acapella,
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.420]   opening the song with acapella,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.180]   just no instruments, just voice.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.180]   That to me, I mean, that's one of the characteristics
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.420]   of the things, of the ways you've brought out
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.700]   the best in an artist is doing less.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.180]   Sort of the tending towards simplicity in some kind of way.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.660]   So that choice of acapella is really interesting
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.620]   'cause I could see a lot of people think
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.260]   that that's a bad idea,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.300]   but it turned out to be a really powerful idea.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.420]   Can you maybe talk about the simplicity,
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.740]   how to find simplicity,
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.940]   why you find simplicity is beautiful?
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.860]   It does appear to be beautiful.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.900]   What is that?
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.860]   - Yeah, I don't know where it comes from.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.460]   It has been with me from the beginning of my work.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.860]   The very first album I ever produced,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.860]   the credit I took was reduced by me
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.140]   instead of produced by me.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.780]   For that reason, I like the idea
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.540]   of getting to the essential.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.540]   And I have a better idea now that I've done it for a while,
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.940]   but at the time it was purely an instinctual thing.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.140]   And part of it is a sonic, there's a sonic benefit,
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.460]   which is the less elements you have,
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.940]   you can hear each of the ones that are there
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   and they can sound better.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.380]   And the less there are,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.700]   the more space they could have around them
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.940]   and the more you can hear their personality.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.940]   If you were to record 10 people playing the same guitar part
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.740]   and you listen to it, it would sound like guitar.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.780]   And if you record one person playing a guitar part,
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.620]   it sounds like a person playing the guitar.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.460]   It's different than just guitar.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.940]   And often in the studio,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.500]   the idea of building upon things
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.420]   and adding layers to thicken, to make it sound bigger,
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   sometimes the more things you add, the smaller it gets.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.460]   So a lot of it is counterintuitive
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.980]   until you just in practice see what works.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.740]   - To try it, to try removing stuff until it's just right.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.100]   It's the Einstein thing,
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.820]   make it as simple as possible, but not simpler.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.460]   That's such a, like finding a stopping place,
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.460]   just keep chopping away and chopping away.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.580]   - Yeah, there's something we also like to do
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.460]   called the ruthless edit, which is,
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.100]   let's say you're at a point where it can work for anything,
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.300]   but I'll give you the example with an album.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.580]   We've recorded 25 songs.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.100]   We think the album is gonna have 10.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.060]   Instead of picking our favorite 10,
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.940]   we limit it to what are the five or six
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.300]   that we can't live without?
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.540]   So going past even the goal
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.820]   to get to the real like heart of it,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.540]   and then see, okay, we have these five or six
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.300]   that we can't live without.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.420]   Now, what would we add to that
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.260]   that makes it better and not worse?
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.580]   - It puts you in a different frame
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.900]   when you start with building instead of removing.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.420]   - And you might find that there's nothing you need to add.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.260]   - Sometimes.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.380]   Sometimes something happens when you get to the real essence.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.740]   Then when you start adding things back,
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.820]   it becomes clear that it was just supposed to be
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.180]   this tight little thing.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.220]   - Can I ask you like a therapy session question?
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.660]   So you mentioned somewhere that one way
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.940]   to kind of think about music to get into music
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.900]   is to look at the top like 100 albums of all time
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.740]   and just go down the list and like just take it all in
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.620]   like one piece of artwork.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.100]   So I was doing that for a while.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.420]   It's a cool experiment 'cause unfortunately I have to admit,
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.060]   I've gotten lazy and stopped taking in albums as albums.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.780]   And I looked at one interesting top 100 list,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.860]   top 500 actually, which is put together by Rolling Stone.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.780]   And they put, this is the therapy session part,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.300]   and this has to do with simplicity too.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.100]   They put Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at number one.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.940]   Spoiler alert.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:51.100]   So I'd like to maybe get your opinion on that choice.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.380]   The reason Marvin Gaye is really interesting,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.780]   it'd actually be cool to play what's going on in a second,
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.660]   but when you just listen to his like acapella,
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.940]   just listen to his voice, it is really good.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.140]   It makes me wonder if it's possible to pull off
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.180]   like most of his songs with no instruments.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.780]   In many parts, there's so much soul
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.820]   in just "Mercy, Mercy Me," "What's Going On."
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.620]   There's so many songs that you could just be like,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.140]   "I wonder if you could just like, just go raw."
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.340]   Or maybe in parts, or maybe do what you do with Jay-Z,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.380]   just open up with nothing.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.700]   Anyway, there's something so powerful
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.180]   to a great soulful voice.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.740]   Do you mind if I play it real quick?
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.580]   - No, please.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.420]   - "What's Going On."
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.300]   This is probably one of my favorite songs.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.420]   I mean, it's up there.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.500]   (indistinct chatter)
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:52.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:30:01.460]   That voice.

[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.700]   I mean, so for people who don't know,
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.140]   his own father ended up killing Marvin Gaye.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.540]   I mean, that one is really painful.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.620]   I mean, for a lot of people,
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.980]   your relationship with your father, your mother,
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.180]   I mean, there's different dynamics,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.100]   but it's almost like part of life is resolving
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.860]   some kind of complex puzzle you have
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.940]   with the people you love, the people close to you,
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.300]   or the people who are not there, all those kinds of things.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.780]   That's so much pain in that,
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.860]   we don't need to escalate, father, father.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.780]   I never thought if it's,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.100]   I always thought it's his father directly.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.180]   - Yeah, I don't get that.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.100]   It could be, but I don't, I feel like it's a more
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:33.700]   masculine spirituality.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.780]   - Like a father figure,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.220]   or just broadly some kind of spirituality.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.500]   - Could be like God, father God, mother God,
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.100]   you know, like could be, I don't know.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.440]   - But there's so much, it's like both hope and melancholy.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.220]   - You're saying war's not the answer.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.500]   It's like, you don't tell that your father war's not,
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.300]   your blood father war's not the answer.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.460]   It's a strange conversation.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.020]   It's a bigger conversation than a personal.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.380]   - Don't you think it feels like war when it's personal?
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.920]   What's the difference between,
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.020]   is, war is personal too.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.860]   It's only leaders think about war in a geopolitical sense.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.660]   When people that fight wars, you lose your brothers,
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.420]   you lose, I mean, death is just right there.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.700]   So it might feel just like that.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.380]   But yeah, there is a dance between like the personal
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.660]   and like talking to the entirety of the society.
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.220]   It's like John Lennon, imagine,
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:36.900]   also a song where, is that hopeful?
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.120]   Is that cynical?
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.540]   Is it like melancholy?
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.480]   Like heartbroken?
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.020]   Like you hope, you wish things would be a certain way
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.940]   and they're not.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.740]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.980]   I don't know if John Lennon is giving up
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.860]   on the world in "Imagine."
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.860]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.580]   No, it's an interesting question.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.260]   There's another John Lennon lyric in,
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:04.860]   let me think of what it is, take me a second.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:11.420]   Different songs keep coming into my head.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.260]   It's not the one that I'm looking for.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.440]   - And you keep pressing next.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.480]   - Um,
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.360]   cross the universe.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.500]   Nothing's gonna change my world.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:30.360]   And when I hear that, I hear it as hopeless.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.380]   But I don't think, I don't believe that that's,
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.200]   well, it may be how he meant it,
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.740]   but I don't think that's how it's normally taken.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.040]   - And it's also the taker is important.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.600]   I'm generally optimistic and hopeful,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.800]   so I always look for the hope.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   And actually the harshest love heartbreak songs
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.080]   are somehow hopeful to me.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.260]   That's a love song.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.760]   To me, a song about losing love
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.460]   is a song about the great capacity for love
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.600]   in the human heart.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.520]   That's what I hear.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.740]   So to me, losing love is exciting.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.040]   'Cause it's like, that means you really cared.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.160]   That means you felt something, you feel something,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.440]   you can sit in that pain,
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.660]   and that pain is a reminder of what it means to be human.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.920]   When you're that, what is it?
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.960]   We're just listening.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.120]   The only man who could have reached me
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.440]   was the son of a preacher man.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.120]   So it's like that early love or something,
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.020]   partially sexual or whatever.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.440]   That's not as interesting to me.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.960]   It's fun, it's great.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.260]   But it's that heartbreak.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.400]   That's the reminder that it can go deep.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.160]   Although that's a damn good song.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.280]   - Have you ever heard the Detroit mix
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   of the Marvin Gaye album?
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.120]   - No.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.200]   - Call it up.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.960]   By far better.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.800]   Mind-blowing.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.460]   I just heard it recently, blew my mind.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.160]   - Oh, wow.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:04.980]   Reverb.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.880]   Distant.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   Interesting.

[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.560]   If you listen to the whole album,
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.200]   even though you just said you don't listen to albums anymore,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.440]   the Detroit mix of the whole album changes the album a lot.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   - I mean, that felt,
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.800]   so that's the opposite of a cappella, I would say.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.640]   - Yes.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.480]   - 'Cause it's,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.400]   there's layers, there's,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.720]   and maybe, I don't know if you remember,
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.360]   but if memory serves me correct here,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.400]   he produces this own album here, Marvin Gaye
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.160]   was the producer on this, I believe.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.000]   - I believe so.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.160]   And this one sounds more like it's a get-together.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.280]   And the whole album sounds more like a get-together
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.960]   where it's a group of people in a room
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.760]   playing music together,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   whereas the album version sounds more like a recording.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.360]   This sounds less like a recording
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.920]   and a little more like a party.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.480]   - Now, you had a series of conversations
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.000]   with Paul McCartney, which is amazing
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.160]   that people should watch,
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.760]   but is there, this is continuing our therapy session,
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.920]   is there a case to be made that what's going on
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.360]   is number one album above the Beatles,
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.040]   a white album, or Abbey Road above Pet Sounds?
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.200]   Can you still manage case?
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.480]   - There's always a case.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.000]   I mean, there's always a case.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.960]   In reality, in art, there is no metric that makes sense.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.760]   So you could put numbers on things,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.760]   but it's like, is this apple better than this peach?
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.600]   Like, it's not really a fair comparison.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.280]   - But if you just had to keep one
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   to represent the human species,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   that's the way I think to the aliens.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.960]   - So I think it's a very personal decision.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.360]   I think you can make your choice
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.040]   to represent the human species and I'll make mine.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.240]   - Well, I would pick the Beatles over the Beach Boys,
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.920]   so that's my, if I became dictator of the world
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.400]   and was talking to the aliens,
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.360]   but I don't know the full historical context
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   to the impact of the music.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.840]   I don't know if that's something to consider,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.240]   like this kind of thought experiment
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.000]   of imagine what it was like back then
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.000]   to create, to go into the studio,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.200]   to do such interesting work in the studio,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:44.120]   as opposed to like listening to just as a pop song almost.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   'Cause I've never been able to understand
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.520]   Beach Boys, God Only Knows.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.160]   - The song God Only Knows?
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.560]   - God Only Knows, but all of it,
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.600]   the album, the Pat Siles just--
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.760]   - In My Room?
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.080]   - What, In My Room?
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.920]   - That song.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.360]   - Is that, what was your favorite on the album?
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.000]   That non-favorite? - On the Pat Siles album?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.240]   - Pat Siles.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.480]   - The opening track.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.360]   - Do you mind if I play it?
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.200]   - Please.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.840]   - It's too fun.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.800]   - That's part of their trip though.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.880]   - You open the heart with the fun?
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.600]   - It's possible.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.800]   Original mono and stereo mix versions.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.960]   - What's the opening song?
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.160]   Wouldn't It Be Nice?
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.320]   Yeah, that's the song.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:48.840]   ♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we were older ♪
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.600]   ♪ Then we wouldn't have to wait so long ♪
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.440]   ♪ And wouldn't it be nice to live together ♪
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.440]   ♪ In the kind of world where we belong ♪
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.720]   ♪ No one's gonna make it that much better ♪
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.560]   ♪ When we can say goodnight and start living together ♪
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.640]   - This part is good, man.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.560]   And then back to fun.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.200]   - Yeah, that we could say goodnight and stay together.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.320]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.280]   - Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.840]   - To wake up together.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.680]   But we're not.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.600]   - There's heartbreak in this one too.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.400]   - Still, to me, George Harrison,
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.320]   is that the way the album, While My Guitar Gently Weeps?
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:37.000]   With the Beatles, it's so hard to,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.040]   depending on the day, I'll say a very different song
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.440]   that's my favorite song, but I often return
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.080]   to While My Guitar Gently Weeps as my favorite song.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.760]   - Spectacular, it's spectacular.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.360]   - And anything George Harrison, honestly.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.280]   Something in the way she moves.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.160]   What would you classify that?
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.120]   - There's several Beatles songs,
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.720]   categories of Beatles songs.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.960]   That's the melancholy love songs
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.640]   or ballads or something like that.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.800]   Yesterday, Let It Be.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.240]   Do you have favorites?
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.040]   So from your, how have you changed as a man,
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.840]   as a human being, as a musician and music producer,
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   ever having done that lengthy interaction with McCartney?
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   - Anytime you're around someone who's such a hero
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.280]   and you spend time with them and they're a human being,
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.760]   it helps put perspective on everything.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.120]   - Oh, that they're just human?
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.560]   - Well, obviously.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.480]   I mean, everyone's just human.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.560]   But I remember the first time I got to see
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.440]   Paul McCartney play live, it was in a stadium
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.920]   of 70,000 people and he started playing
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.800]   and I started crying and I couldn't believe I was in,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.880]   even with 70,000 people, I couldn't believe
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.440]   that this man walks the earth
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.560]   and that I'm in the same place as him
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.400]   and he's the person who wrote that and played that
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.840]   and now he's here playing it for us.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.160]   Mind-blowing.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.280]   That's the voice.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.720]   - That's the, I--
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   - It's overwhelming.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.800]   - Is it inspiring or is it,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.600]   like, 'cause sometimes when you have,
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.080]   and I've gotten a chance to meet,
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.800]   I mean, I love people in general,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   like every person is fascinating to me,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.600]   but yeah, when you've been a fan for a long time
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.520]   and you meet a person, sort of,
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.800]   I'll just remove present company,
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   is you, it's like, oh, they're just human.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.280]   So there's both, it's both inspiring
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.140]   that just a simple human can achieve such beautiful things,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.820]   but it's also like almost wishing
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.720]   there were gods moving around us.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.420]   It's somehow peaceful.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.300]   It's more comforting to know that there's,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.340]   there's bigger fish, I'm just a small fish,
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.860]   and then there's bigger fish,
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.780]   and they will take care of the ocean for us.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.660]   - I think we're all capable of being big fish.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.220]   I don't think that there are special people.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.860]   I don't think it's like that.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:19.340]   I would make a case, so the variety of artists
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.140]   that you worked with and brought the best out of,
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.280]   it does seem that you're out of this world.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.600]   So do you think you would know,
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.860]   like, if you're the same kind of species,
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.100]   maybe you're just a meat vehicle,
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.940]   and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else?
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.300]   - I feel like I'm channeling ideas
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.100]   from somewhere else, 100%.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:45.580]   But I think--
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.060]   - Have you asked questions about where from?
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.860]   - I believe we all are, though.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.140]   I believe we are,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:57.540]   we're vehicles for information
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.700]   that when it's ready to come through, it comes through,
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.780]   and the people who have good antennas pick up the signal.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.660]   But if, I'm sure you've had an experience in your life
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.340]   where you've had an idea for something,
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.020]   and you've not acted on it,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.420]   and eventually someone else does it,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.660]   and it's not because they're doing it
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.700]   because you had the idea and they stole your idea,
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.120]   it's because the time has come for that idea.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.820]   And if you don't do it, someone else is gonna do it.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.780]   - It's being broadcast by whatever the source is.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.180]   - Whatever the source is.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.140]   - Yeah, I tend to,
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.860]   I tend to see humans as not quite special in that way, yeah.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.460]   It's different kinds of antennas walking around,
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.020]   listening to ideas, and ideas that are,
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:44.020]   I like the notion of Richard Dawkins of memes,
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.420]   it's kind of the ideas of the organisms,
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.660]   and they're just using our brains to multiply,
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.220]   to select, to compete, to evolve.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.860]   And humans, we really wanna hold onto the specialness
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.140]   of our body, of our mind, but it's really the ideas.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.980]   So if Rick Rubin was born two centuries ago,
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.740]   you wouldn't be a music producer.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.840]   You'd be, or I mean, maybe,
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.540]   but you have an antenna.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.740]   And if no signal's coming in,
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.740]   or you'd be hearing potentially a different signal.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.500]   Is there--
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   - I think we all have our own antenna for whatever it is
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.800]   that we, maybe not everyone has tuned into their antenna
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.820]   to see what it is that their strength
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.180]   in bringing through is.
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.460]   I'm lucky in that it found me,
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.820]   'cause I didn't know that it was a,
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.060]   I didn't even know this was a job.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:41.780]   I sometimes wonder, I mean, a lot of young people,
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.860]   a lot of people wonder, like, what's the purpose
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.080]   and the specs of my antenna?
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.480]   What am I put on this earth to do?
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:58.380]   Like if, you know, I can live a thousand lives.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.620]   There's so many trajectories.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.300]   And imagine the greatest possible trajectory
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.020]   that reveals the most beautiful thing
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.820]   I can possibly create in this world.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.680]   Live the most beautiful way.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.740]   What is that?
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.300]   I feel like that's a good exercise to think about.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.700]   'Cause it's also liberating to think
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.040]   that you can do anything.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.720]   I mean, that, more and more, I suppose that's kind of life.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.940]   It's like society is pushing conformity on you.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.580]   You know, I thought, I had my own flavor of conformity.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.300]   I thought I was supposed to be following.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.500]   And then early on, I would say like in the late 20s,
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.780]   you realize, wait a minute, you don't have to tell,
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.620]   you don't have to do what teachers tell you to do,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.100]   what parents tell you to do, what society tells you to do.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.280]   You can, like, I would never wear a suit
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.580]   if I listened to like my colleagues in community
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:01.580]   who think that a suit is like the symbol of, what is it?
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.620]   A symbol of conformity, actually, which is hilarious.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.220]   But it's actually a kind of rebellion
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.020]   and everything else of that nature,
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.260]   doing these silly podcasts.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.780]   - I have a question I have to ask.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.340]   - Sure. - 'Cause you brought up the suit.
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.980]   - Yeah.
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.980]   - Do you wear the suit?
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.320]   Is this your daily uniform outside of podcasting?
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.580]   - So for the longest time, it was some kind of suit.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.500]   And then recently, coinciding with going to Texas,
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.480]   I'm such a loner, I'm an introvert,
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.160]   and there's a bit of a hiding from the world
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.740]   when I wear other stuff.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:49.980]   I really want to not make fame, recognition,
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:56.560]   money, all of those things a motivation at all.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.480]   And the world kind of wants you to make those motivations.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.120]   Not the world, but I would say maybe the Western world,
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.540]   maybe America, maybe a capitalist system does.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.520]   But--
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.120]   - That's a choice to buy into that or not.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.520]   - Right.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.760]   It takes a brave person, a person of character
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.640]   to not buy in.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.440]   And I'm like a baby deer trying to find its legs.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.620]   You don't have to buy in.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.080]   'Cause I love people, and I think I'm kind of an idiot.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.280]   And so when other people say, do this and do that,
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.680]   there is a pressure there.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.640]   It's actually very difficult to not listen necessarily
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.360]   to the advice of others,
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.600]   and yet keep yourself fragile and open to the world.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.160]   It's easy to be like, I'm always right,
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.260]   just kind of sticking your ground.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.440]   But if you want to be vulnerable,
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.720]   if you want to connect with people
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.880]   and just wear your heart on your sleeve,
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.960]   then you're going to listen to them.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.120]   I mean, that's the double-edged sword of it.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:04.720]   But then again, that pain, if you don't let it destroy you,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.240]   you can grow from that.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.800]   Has fame affected you at all?
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.440]   Did you unplug from the system at some point?
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.280]   - Same.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.440]   I've always been sort of removed.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.480]   I don't feel like I'm part of any system.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.400]   - Do you feel famous?
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.760]   - I'm aware that when I go out,
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.480]   people say nice things to me, which is great.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.440]   (laughing)
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.720]   But that's about it.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.800]   That's about as far as it goes.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.520]   - But it doesn't affect your art, about your creativity,
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.600]   or your thoughts.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.800]   Like when you're sitting alone and thinking about the world.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.920]   - It can't.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   It's a destructive force.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:46.120]   The reason that you're who you are,
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.280]   and the reason that you're finding the success
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.080]   you're finding is because you've been true to yourself
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.800]   to get to that stage.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   So to start changing that, to either conform
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:01.200]   to someone else's idea of what you should be doing,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.280]   it just seems like it doesn't make sense.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.480]   - Do you have a sense of who you are?
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.040]   'Cause I don't necessarily have a--
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:09.880]   - I don't know.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.960]   I know that I really like making good things,
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.360]   and I know that I'm crazy about it in that
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.000]   it's like an obsession.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.840]   And I want things to be as good as they could be,
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.680]   whatever it is.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.840]   And if I finish a music project,
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.640]   and I have a window of time where I'm not working on music,
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.560]   I might be moving the furniture around in the house.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.560]   You know, I'm always looking for a creative outlet
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.440]   to find a way to make something better.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.160]   Or there was a period of time where I was in a weird
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.080]   corporate situation that was,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.680]   that didn't allow me to flourish.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   And I turned, I focused the creativity in on myself,
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   and I lost a bunch of weight and changed my life.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.800]   - So that was the kind of art,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.200]   like you've gone through a whole process of losing weight,
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.120]   getting in shape, getting healthy.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.240]   That was a kind of creative act.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   - It certainly was.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.520]   It wasn't an intentional creative act,
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   but I had a lot of energy.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:16.520]   And I just, a series of events happened.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.960]   I read a book.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.280]   At the time, that was my heaviest.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.760]   I weighed about 318 pounds.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.400]   And I'd never been, I'd been sedentary my whole life,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.240]   basically laying on a couch working on music.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.960]   So I've never been physically active in my life.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.200]   And I read a book about a guy named Stu Middleman, a runner,
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.840]   who ran a thousand miles in 11 days.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.280]   And I thought, wow, I get out of breath
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.600]   walking to the corner,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.000]   and another human being can run a thousand miles in 11 days.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.360]   I feel like I have bad information.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.160]   Clearly I'm doing something wrong.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.360]   And I reached out to a person
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.080]   that Stu mentioned in the book, Phil Maffetone.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.120]   - Who's a legend.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.080]   I really appreciate him as well.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.360]   He's Math 180 Method 2.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.320]   He's such an interesting, I think he focuses on--
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   - Heart rate training.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   And he was the first person to talk about essentially a--
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.720]   - Low carbs.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.920]   Paleo, keto diet.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.400]   - For a person-- - 40 years ago.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.960]   - For a person who's going to be healthy,
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.600]   who can exercise and actually perform at an early level.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.040]   He's the first person when I,
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.560]   talking about heart rate training,
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.760]   him and other endurance athletes he influenced,
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.680]   he gave me permission to run slower.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.520]   - Yeah.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.960]   - It was the first time I realized,
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.480]   oh, I can run long distance as if I just run slower
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.000]   and then take that seriously.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.720]   And I actually fell in love with running very much so.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.600]   'Cause for me, everyone's different,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.000]   but for me the love of running happens
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.920]   in the longer distances.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.960]   - Did you read Born to Run?
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.800]   Great book.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.620]   - Amazing book.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.520]   There is something special about running.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.760]   And everybody has their own journey with it.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.560]   And even ultra marathon running, those kinds of things.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.080]   It is like many journeys,
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.640]   one that can pull you in.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.520]   Like you won't be the same person after.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:22.000]   And I try to be deliberate about making choices
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.220]   after which you'll not be the same person.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:29.620]   And so I'm nervous about the ultra marathon running world.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:35.640]   I have to talk to you about Johnny Cash.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.640]   I mean, when people ask me what my favorite musical thing is
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.980]   of all time,
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:53.160]   you know, it's a very difficult question to answer,
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.880]   of course, but I'm pretty quick,
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.280]   if I'm not allowed to pick anything by Tom Ways,
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:04.080]   I'm pretty quick to say Hurt by Johnny Cash,
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.480]   the performance, the whatever you call it,
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.800]   whatever the heck that is.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   Because that's not just a song covered by an artist.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.500]   That's a human being at the end of their life.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.140]   That the rawness of that,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.880]   I mean, just there's also a music video,
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.160]   which for a lot of people adds a lot to it.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.520]   For me, just the music alone is,
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.680]   I mean, the guitar, every choice on that.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.320]   See, the few things I've heard about it,
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.200]   it seemed like almost accidental.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.360]   I mean, like little subtle choices here and there.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   Can you maybe comment on that to the degree,
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.480]   I think you had a huge role
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.280]   in sort of bringing Johnny Cash back
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.600]   from a different part of his life.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.520]   It's like bringing something out that wasn't there before.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.720]   And it was incredible.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.520]   It was a celebration of a really special musician.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.960]   And that's totally new kind of celebration.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.560]   Now, Hurt is just one of the songs
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.240]   that's an amazing celebration of Johnny Cash.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.280]   But Hurt is like at the peak of that.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.900]   So what was that like putting that song together?
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.200]   It might be nice to listen to it
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   'cause I freaking love that song.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.780]   And as a guitarist,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.400]   I just, the simplicity of it,
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.840]   it seems like every choice contributes
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.300]   to the greatness of the song.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.100]   (gentle music)
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:51.440]   Simple, it's crisp, but it's dark too.

[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.240]   - It's one of the greatest opening lines of any song.

[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.440]   the choice of instrument, the layers there,
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   the freedom to give him, to use the voice that's fading.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:34.120]   It's not fading, it's changing.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.240]   Maybe he's losing some aspects of his voice.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.000]   And it's almost like shaking a little bit.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.160]   And it's a little bit out of tune in parts.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.160]   How much of that was deliberate?
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:56.040]   Like, how do you give Johnny Cash the freedom to do that?
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.680]   How do you find that together?
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.760]   Is there any insights you can give?
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.600]   - I think it's a case almost of like the right,
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.680]   pairing the right role with the right actor, you could say.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.920]   The song lyrics, the reason we chose the song
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.320]   was because of the lyrics, purely about the lyrics.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.480]   And at that point in time,
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.440]   both Johnny and I would send each other songs
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.480]   of possible ideas to record.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:27.200]   And that was one that I sent him
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.160]   and he didn't respond to initially.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.080]   I would send him, at that time we would burn CDs
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.040]   and I would send him like CD of 20 songs or 25 songs.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.600]   And then, and he would send them to me.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.040]   - You burn a CD for Johnny Cash
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.720]   and you send him of different songs.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.200]   - Of like songs to consider recording.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.040]   - Yeah.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:46.600]   - And we would send these back and forth.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.920]   And then that I had hurt on one of the ones that I sent him
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.760]   and he didn't respond.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.640]   And usually if he didn't respond, we didn't go back to it.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.200]   And that one, I remember I sent it again
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.560]   and I put it first on the next CD.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.920]   And when we spoke about when he listened to the CD again,
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.760]   he didn't respond.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.320]   I said, check out that first song.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.360]   And I really feel like that one could be good.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.600]   - What did you see in that song?
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.040]   - It's the lyrics.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.120]   It's the lyrics.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.600]   'Cause I feel like nobody,
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.800]   there's very few people in the world
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:24.840]   that would see these lyrics in Johnny Cash's mouth
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.520]   and think this is a good idea, including Trent Reznor.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.360]   - Yeah.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.520]   I know that Trent had trepidations in the beginning.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.960]   But if you listen to the words, if you forget the music
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.920]   and if you forget what Nine Inch Nails sounds like
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.840]   and you just read it like a poem,
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.520]   and then you imagine a 70 year old man reading these lyrics,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.880]   it'll be profound.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.200]   It's profound.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.840]   So that was the, based on the lyrics
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.000]   that started the journey.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.360]   And then at this point in time,
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.880]   Johnny was not in great health.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.720]   And sometimes I would go to Nashville
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.800]   and record with him at his house.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.240]   Sometimes he would come to California,
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.800]   but he was coming to California less regularly.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.240]   And because there were so many songs we wanted to try,
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.480]   he would start sometimes recording
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.240]   just a straight acoustic version.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.560]   Like he would have someone play guitar, he would sing,
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.760]   and they would send those to me.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.320]   And we would discuss like, is this one to build on?
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.880]   And that was when we said,
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.040]   I don't wanna record this one until we're together.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.080]   I feel like we should do this one together.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.600]   So on the next trip to California,
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.080]   we recorded it at my old house.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   And I mean, all the songs we recorded felt special.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:55.360]   So I can't say this one felt special,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.320]   but lyrically it just, it's more,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   the lyrics have such a profound sense of regret.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.760]   - What have I become?
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.800]   - Yeah, and to hear, when you're 20 years old,
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.440]   talking about regret, it's heartbreaking,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.800]   but it's heartbreaking in a different way
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.520]   because you have a whole life to figure it out.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.240]   When you're looking back over your life
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.400]   at the end of your life with regret, it's brutal.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.320]   It's brutal.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.600]   So that was the initial spark of doing it.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.160]   And then when we recorded it,
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.160]   I believe it was two guitar players,
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.880]   if I remember correctly, maybe even three,
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.400]   Smokey Hormel, Matt Sweeney, and Mike Campbell, I believe.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.600]   And Ben Montench was playing the piano in my living room
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.800]   as we were doing it.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.880]   And we cut the basic track with Johnny singing.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.880]   And then Johnny probably sang over that basic track
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.440]   a few more times.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.200]   And then we comped his vocal and then built up the drama.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.000]   And you didn't get to the part,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   but at the end of the song, it gets very loud.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.120]   The music gets very loud.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.200]   It's subtle because it's not anything that takes your ear
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.680]   and the vocal is so powerful
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.160]   that you don't really think about what's going on.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.600]   - But it's building the whole time musically.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.720]   - It's building and it even gets distorted at the end.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.240]   It gets really like overpowering.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:36.080]   And that's part of the emotion of it.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.120]   - It's a...
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.480]   (soft music)
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.920]   I hear almost the anger and frustration.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.520]   ♪ You know ♪

[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.200]   - And it just rings out, the clean vocal.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.800]   I mean, it's so simple, so incredible.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.960]   And it's interesting to have a young man's lyrics
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.960]   in an old Johnny Cash voice and heart and mind.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.440]   Are you a fan of Tom Waits?
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.280]   - Of course.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.240]   - Tom Waits, when he was younger,
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.600]   there's a song called "Martha,"
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.720]   but there's a bunch of songs he's written when he was young.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.280]   It's like, how does a young man
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.840]   have that like melancholy wisdom?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.680]   The song "Martha" is about an older man
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.640]   calling a woman he used to love
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.840]   that she's now married and he's married.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.320]   And they're having that conversation.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.240]   They haven't spoken for 30 years
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.160]   and they realize that there's still love there
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.560]   and it could have been a different life,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.200]   a different world where they could have been together.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.080]   And here's like a 23-year-old Tom Waits
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.440]   writing so beautifully about something that's very...
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.640]   I've had a lot of people like tell me
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.840]   how real that as an older person,
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   looking back at that love that you had
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.960]   and realizing it wasn't, it was really, it's still there.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.160]   Inklings of that love are still there.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.280]   - I think there's a...
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:36.100]   When a young person writes a sad song,
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:43.160]   they almost seem more willing to go to a more hopeless place
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.160]   because they have a long journey ahead.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.960]   And older artists tend to wanna look
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.600]   at the bright side of things,
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.440]   which also I think comes from the wisdom of aging.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.360]   It's a more realistic position.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.400]   So it's not uncommon for younger people to write.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.680]   I think even in the Beatles,
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.200]   you'll see like they're very heavy lyrics,
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.680]   middle to late era Beatles, which is still,
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.800]   they're in their early 20s, I guess.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.600]   - Wow, that's hard to think about.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.640]   So much accomplished. - Unbelievable.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.320]   - And they went through the full journey
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.200]   from fun to darkness in the span of a few years.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.380]   You mentioned lyrics.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.260]   So you've obviously produced albums with incredible lyrics.
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.200]   I think you've mentioned the interesting characteristics
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   of hip hop, of rap is that you're writing poetry to rhythm
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.820]   versus writing poetry to melody.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:50.840]   So that's like one way to think about it.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.520]   And I'm a fan, I mean, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen,
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.140]   I'm a fan of poetry, period.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:01.640]   Is there something about highlighting the poetry of it,
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.840]   the power of words as you did with "Hurt"?
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   - If I have to put, it's one, a Tom Waits song
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.200]   that's like less than a minute long
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.000]   that I always go back to, it's one I really love.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.660]   And it has just a few lines.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.840]   It's called "I Want You."
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.660]   And all it is is him saying, "I want you."
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.240]   (gentle music)
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.640]   ♪ I want you, you, you ♪
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.400]   - This is a 22 year old Tom Waits.

[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:27.880]   (laughs)
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.720]   - Yeah, beautiful.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.000]   So simple, man, that young man,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.440]   but for people who don't know Tom Waits,
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.960]   you should definitely listen to him.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.920]   And his voice sounds very different now.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.920]   And it's interesting to see the evolution of a human voice,
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.160]   the artist over time,
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.560]   because that's a young, boy-like voice, hopeful,
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.240]   less clever, less witty, more simple.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.080]   That simplicity is there.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.440]   And he's not, I mean, that takes guts to be so simple,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.920]   I would say, lyrically and musically.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.920]   Is there, sort of laying that out on the table,
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.280]   is there ways that you like to highlight the voice,
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   the lyrics, or is there's no one rule?
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.680]   So do you, what is the thing that makes music special?
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.840]   Is it the rhythm, the melody,
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.520]   or is ultimately the lyrics are always there, or the idea?
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.920]   - You just asked me five different questions.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.480]   - I don't care, I'll just get back.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.600]   (laughs)
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.600]   It's not about you.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.880]   (laughs)
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.920]   - You don't want the answers.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.760]   - I don't want the answers.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.600]   - Just wanna ask questions.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.280]   Okay, I'll listen.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.360]   (laughs)
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:45.560]   - I look forward to your comments, the internet.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.400]   Okay.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.080]   (laughs)
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.440]   You have the greatest producer of all time in front of you,
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.000]   and you can't shut the hell up.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.540]   That's right, friends.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.060]   Is, but you do value lyrics.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.460]   Is there a way to celebrate lyrics?
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.660]   - I value lyrics if the lyrics are important.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.460]   I'm not a lyric person.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:08.460]   I'm very much, whatever the thing that makes the thing good
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.260]   is the thing that I'm drawn to, for me.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.500]   For a long time, lyrics meant very little.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.540]   I would say from the--
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.380]   - Really?
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.220]   - Yes. - In the beginning?
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.060]   - Yes.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:19.880]   From the earliest days--
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.540]   - Fight for your right to party, Beastie Boys?
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.900]   - Yeah, it was fun.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.180]   I thought they were good lyrics,
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.960]   but it wasn't what was important.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.060]   I mean, it was in a, almost a novelty way,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.220]   not in a serious way.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:38.220]   Early in my career, I was much more focused on the rhythm,
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:40.240]   first the rhythm.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:44.980]   And I would, if the lyrics weren't good enough,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.900]   I would be aware of it,
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.980]   but it wasn't the driving force for me.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.340]   And eventually over time,
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.280]   then melody became an important piece,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.340]   which it wasn't in the beginning.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.820]   And then lyrics became more important over time,
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.540]   but it's always been a,
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:05.100]   always changing what draws me in.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.140]   And one of the things I found as it relates to lyrics
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.140]   that can give a lyric a different power
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:18.920]   has to do with rhythm, where if there's no drum,
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.360]   the lyrics tend to mean more.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.220]   So earlier what you were saying about
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.800]   if it was just acapella,
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.220]   you felt Marvin Gaye in a different way
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.500]   hearing the acapella.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.260]   - Can you comment on, I mean,

[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.460]   - But this is, you're not doing anything else.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.460]   You're doing the, there's strumming,
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.220]   and then there's just a single beat.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:07.180]   And then it builds.

[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.860]   and the instruments not getting in the way.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.720]   I mean, the same with her and Johnny Cash.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:17.900]   Is there, why does it sound so like raw?
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.380]   It's the same as her.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.820]   There's a, it feels like you're in the room with them.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.220]   It feels like they're not even singing.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.020]   They're like, they're literally freshly mad and angry.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.220]   - I think those are the things
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.700]   that make great singers sound like great singers.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:37.900]   It's not anything that's happening in the studio.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.100]   I mean, I would say the only thing
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.620]   that us in the studio can do
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:46.620]   is kind of get out of the way and not ruin it.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:51.580]   You know, it's like, that's what comes through
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.220]   of these people.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:56.140]   - I should also, before I forget,
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.380]   there is a lot of song choices on that CD.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.900]   I would love to see the full options on the CD
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.660]   that you sent to Johnny Cash that I love.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.860]   So "Solitary Man" is one of my favorite choices made there.
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:11.380]   Is that a Neil Diamond song?
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.820]   - It's funny you talk about them as songs
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:17.500]   'cause I tend to listen more to albums than songs.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.340]   So.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.780]   - That's what you're doing in your head.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.140]   You're pulling up the album, essentially.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   - No, I'm like, I'm going to that song,
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.720]   but I don't know, I've never listened to that song.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.940]   But I know that when that song comes up
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.020]   in the sequence of the album,
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.020]   it has a really powerful effect in me.

[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.360]   - Such a beautiful melody in "Haunting Words".
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.680]   - It's sung so simply.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   I have to, I mean, so I was born in the Soviet Union.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.400]   When you're growing up,
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.680]   there's a few bands that kinda,
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.400]   I mean, they're probably forbidden still,
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   but they seep in and you get like bootlegged
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.240]   and they somehow take over the culture
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.760]   of the young folks such as myself.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.760]   So on the metal side, it was Metallica and Iron Maiden.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.960]   And on the, I don't know what you call them,
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.960]   but Beastie Boys, I remember hearing "Fight for Your Right"
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.200]   and it was just like, for some reason that stuck
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.000]   as it did for a lot of people in Russia.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.080]   It's like, wow, America is when you get to say fuck you
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.680]   to the man, the rebellion, the freedom.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.440]   I probably heard it a few years after it was released
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.920]   because it kinda, it dissipates to the culture.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.960]   You get the bootleg, I mean, it's hard to get your hands on.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.760]   I just remember, I wanna kinda bring that up
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:03.240]   because it was such a personally important song to me.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.160]   And yet probably you didn't even think of that.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.080]   You probably thought of it as its role in the culture here
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.000]   in the United States, like in terms of musically.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.440]   - But I was 20, 21 years old and we just--
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.280]   - Well, you were that kid too, right?
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.840]   - Yeah, we were just making fun songs for our friends.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.920]   There was no expectation.

[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:31.760]   - So hearing that and hearing Metallica, Master of Puppets,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.360]   I was like, I knew I'm gonna have to end up
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.560]   in America one day.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.360]   I mean, maybe now that I'm more mature
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.440]   or maybe a little bit more mature,
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.360]   I realized that was kind of the longing for freedom.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.400]   It felt like, at least at the time,
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.720]   if this is allowed, then anything is allowed.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.840]   - Yeah.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.840]   - And I think that the rebellion of it,
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.880]   I guess it's also fun.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.000]   I just loved it.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.080]   If you look back to that, 'cause you were,
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.400]   I mean, you were that person, not just the producer.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.240]   It feels like--
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.080]   - Well, yes and no.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.680]   Like it was, even to us then, it was still satirical.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.640]   You know, it wasn't just-- - It was.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.240]   But isn't music in part, like you're dancing in the line,
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.640]   it's part satirical, part serious in the sense,
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.960]   like you're losing yourself in the satire?
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.840]   Anytime you go over the top, isn't that part of the,
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:37.600]   or is it explicitly satirical?
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.280]   You're making fun, I mean, "Girls,"
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.200]   there's a lot of ridiculous songs in that album.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.920]   - I don't know, I just think it was definitely
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.360]   to make each other laugh.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.560]   Like we were trying to make each other laugh.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.760]   We weren't trying to make a point.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.840]   We were trying to make each other laugh.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.600]   - But that person, how's that person different
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.800]   than the person today in you?
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.600]   The person that produced that record?
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.000]   - I wouldn't say so different.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.600]   It's like, it really is that,
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.040]   I like things that make me laugh.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.560]   You know, I like ridiculous things.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.880]   - It's the same person still.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.120]   - I think so.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.440]   - Is it strange, just how many incredible--
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.480]   - I mean, I don't think I would make that today,
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.360]   but I understand why we made it when we did.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:23.360]   It's in the vocabulary of ridiculous
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.160]   that would make sense to do.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.920]   You know, for the right artist today,
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.600]   could make something ridiculous and gives you that feeling.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.200]   - I mean, there's just a sense when you make
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.280]   so many different albums,
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.080]   then you look back at that creation,
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.960]   and it can feel like a different person created that.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.480]   But you're making it seem like if you travel back in time,
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.280]   or maybe do a memory replay,
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.520]   you'd be able to hang out with a teenage
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.320]   and then a 20s recruitment.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.640]   - I don't think I was so different, honestly.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.600]   - That's hilarious.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.600]   - It's funny, I ran into someone recently in Costa Rica,
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.440]   who I hadn't seen in a long time,
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.800]   and who I knew from the New York days
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   when those days, and we spent a couple of hours talking
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.360]   and she said, "You're exactly the same person
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.680]   that you were then."
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   So I have a short, you know, a recent confirmation
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.160]   that that's the case.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.280]   - That's beautiful.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.320]   Was it, Tim Ferriss asked you about like,
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.080]   who's the most successful person you know?
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.920]   That's the definition of success, I would say.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.720]   You're exactly the same person.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.240]   You haven't lost yourself,
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.840]   or rather you found yourself early on.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.080]   - I would say there are aspects of me
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.840]   that have changed for sure,
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.720]   but I can't say that it's necessarily better.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.600]   It's different.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.600]   I would say at that time,
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.320]   I was more confident than I am now,
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.560]   and I'm very confident now,
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.280]   but then I had an unrealistic confidence.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.920]   And I think now it's a little more based in reality.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.240]   At that point in time, I had never been depressed.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.560]   And then once you go through a depression,
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.400]   well, some people I know in my case,
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.480]   when I went through depression afterwards,
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.640]   I was a different person than I was before.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:33.520]   And I feel more grounded now than I did then.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.480]   And I probably relate to the artists who,
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.360]   so many of the artists I work with suffer.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.520]   So many artists suffer because that's part
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.560]   of what makes an artist great,
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.240]   is their level of sensitivity.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:53.040]   That the same thing that makes an artist uncomfortable,
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.600]   other people don't feel at all.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:01.000]   - The time you were depressed,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.400]   what was the darkest moments of your life?
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.240]   What took you there?
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.040]   How did you get out?
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.320]   - It was triggered by a person making a comment
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.400]   about something to do with work that didn't matter.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.880]   It was like to anyone else, they would hear that
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.720]   and it would just be like,
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.920]   "Okay, we'll deal with it next week, whatever."
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.760]   But for some reason, I took it in a way that I felt
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.120]   like the rug had been pulled out from under me.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   Even beyond the rational part of it, of understanding,
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.240]   even after the problem that came up was solved,
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.320]   it somehow undermined something in me
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.840]   and made me feel very vulnerable
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.320]   in a way that I hadn't felt before.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.120]   - And it spiraled, how did you get out?
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.880]   - I did a lot of different kinds of therapy.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.520]   I did, starting with alternative therapies,
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.860]   I was seeing, I would say,
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.560]   between seven and eight doctors and or therapists a week.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:12.080]   Acupuncture, talk therapy, herbs,
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:19.160]   or any possible modality, tried everything for a long time.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:24.720]   And nothing seemed to have an impact.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.720]   And then finally, I'm wary of taking any Western medicine.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:40.760]   I'm not a drug taker or drinker or partier in any way.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:48.040]   And I found a psychopharmacologist who was a psychic,
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.840]   but because she was a psychic, I was okay to see her
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:56.600]   'cause like, I'll listen to a psychic,
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.680]   but I'm not gonna listen to a psychopharmacologist.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.340]   But the fact that she had the psychic,
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.920]   that made her fit into my worldview.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.880]   And she recommended antidepressant,
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.960]   which went terribly wrong in the first night that I took it.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.720]   And then that set me on a journey
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.440]   of looking for the right antidepressant,
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.120]   which was a long and painful process.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.200]   - That's a heck of a journey.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.360]   - Every one that I took made me sick, every one.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.480]   And then finally, so I don't know, five months later,
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.880]   six months later, I found the magic one that worked for me.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   And it shifted me out of the depression.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.000]   I took it for, I can't remember, it was six months
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.520]   or a year, and then weaned off and was okay.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.120]   And then I had another event some years later.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.160]   I think I took it again for a short period of time
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.880]   and got out of it and I've not needed it since.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.280]   - Were you able to kind of introspect the triggers
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.700]   that led to the events?
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:02.680]   Or is it random events of life?
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:07.680]   - I think it's more that because of the way that I grew up,
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.740]   I never had to deal with much controversy.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:18.840]   And when I was challenged,
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.960]   I didn't have any ability to deal with it.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.240]   It's like Jonathan Haidt talks about, it's like that.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.080]   - So you've actually also mentioned
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.720]   like business sometimes gives you stress.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.440]   So this was business-related stuff.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.360]   - Yeah, it was a business-related thing.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.080]   It just made me feel bad.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:40.320]   - It's one of the sadder things about art and music
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.680]   is that it's often interleaved with business folk.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.720]   I suppose that's the way of the world
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.320]   if you have a capitalist system,
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   but it makes that business folks rubbing up against artists
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:01.920]   can sometimes destroy a fragile mind and soul.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:07.120]   To me, like one of the best representations of an artist,
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.760]   honestly, is Johnny Ive, the designer from Apple.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.640]   And he's just so fragile with his ideas.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.800]   And you talked about like when he has ideas,
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.600]   he really wouldn't show it to Steve Jobs or anybody
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.440]   except for the small design team
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.520]   'cause he was so nervous that it would break.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.880]   Let's give it a chance, let it give it a chance to grow.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.240]   And it seems like the outside world,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.080]   business people, PR people,
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.360]   people that kind of have not lost themselves
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.120]   in the passion of creating,
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.760]   but instead are kind of representing
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.040]   or like making deals, all that kind of stuff.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.120]   They can kind of trample on those little ideas.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.400]   And it's sad to see.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.280]   It's really heartbreaking to see
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.080]   'cause you know how much trampling there's going on.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.560]   - It's one of the main jobs,
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.560]   my jobs as a record producer is to keep the voices
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.080]   away from the artist,
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.040]   from all of the people who are really on their side,
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.360]   but don't know, like the, whether it be people,
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.720]   anyone on the business side who doesn't make things
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.200]   they're excited to do their part.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.040]   You know, they're excited.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.760]   If when you deliver the thing, the art that you make to me,
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.680]   then we can start the project.
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.600]   But there's nothing to sell
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.040]   if the art doesn't happen in the right way
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:33.120]   and it has to be protected and it can't happen
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.120]   on the same kind of a timetable that business can.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.080]   It's just a different thing.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.840]   It doesn't, art doesn't come in a quarterly way.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.400]   - And that doesn't apply just to music or it applies to art,
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.000]   it applies to all creative pursuits.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.500]   Like this is generally the case, like at MIT,
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.800]   it's just, there's the administration
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.400]   and then there is the professors and students.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.240]   And the professors and students are the creative folk.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.800]   They create stuff, they dream,
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.720]   they have wild ideas that go on tangents and so on.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.160]   They have hopes and they go with those
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.640]   and they get like on these weird, passionate pursuits
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.320]   and then the administration can often just trample on that.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:22.920]   And they set up bars on all kinds of,
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.320]   in all kinds of ways
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.480]   that you think you're not actually hurting,
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.140]   but you really are.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.600]   And I won't mention why, but,
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.120]   'cause this happens to everybody
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.320]   and I have a large amount of leverage at MIT now,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.520]   but even I get a little bit of pressure
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.880]   in such stupid ways to like, don't,
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:47.360]   like be careful, be careful, Lex.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.880]   Like we really want your career to succeed, be careful.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.400]   And that little pressure to an artist,
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.920]   do you wanna go acapella?
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.020]   Do you wanna go, do you want to do a country record?
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.680]   Like be careful, like you're already a superstar,
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.800]   be careful.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.880]   And then in that way, you kinda push people,
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.880]   like flock of fish into one fish tank
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.680]   but they're all the same.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.280]   And it's sad to see.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.560]   And it's obviously in the modern world,
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.400]   there's nice mechanism to protect,
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.440]   to let artists flourish a little bit more
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.240]   'cause they get to put themselves to the world
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.220]   and get a little bit more confidence,
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:26.260]   maybe different funding mechanisms, all that kind of stuff.
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.760]   - Tremendous problem.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.480]   The voices that don't understand
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.440]   interfering with the process is huge.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.760]   The other side of it is in success,
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.600]   there can be a lack of reality
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.840]   where all of the people around the successful person
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.000]   just tell them everything they do is great.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.040]   And then they don't have anything to bump up against anymore
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:52.040]   or have a realistic sense of how things work
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:57.360]   or how things measure.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.360]   So both sides are really important,
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:06.360]   both avoiding the voices getting in the way
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.560]   and having a trusted group of, a sangha,
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.000]   a group of people who can say,
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.040]   I don't know if that's as good.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.280]   And you can still say, I don't care what you think,
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.960]   that's fine, but it helps to hear it.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:26.960]   It helps to have, if someone who you respect
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.860]   tells you something isn't good enough, it's helpful.
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.760]   - When you know it comes from a place of love,
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.400]   when it comes from a place of wisdom.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.880]   - 100%, and not from a place of fear,
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.560]   not from a place of, oh, this doesn't sound like
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.440]   it's gonna do as well as your last thing.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:45.660]   That's not the point.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:49.620]   The point is on this quest for greatness,
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:55.180]   are you living up to your ability?
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.960]   - By the way, is there something interesting to say
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.200]   about your worldview?
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.400]   'Cause you mentioned psychic
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.400]   and sort of the ways we can be healthy,
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:09.920]   the ways we can grow in how much maybe medicine
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.480]   or science has the answers.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:18.120]   Is there some interesting way to describe that worldview?
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.960]   - I would just say I'm open-minded.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.620]   I believe anything's possible.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:26.960]   And if I was gonna trust in any practical information,
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.200]   it would be something thousands of years old.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.040]   - There's wisdom in that history, yeah.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.180]   - Well, it's more tested.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.360]   It's not always right,
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:42.240]   but at least it's been somewhat tested.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.760]   - Though science is also tested.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.200]   The thing I'm a little bit skeptical of sometimes
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.080]   is just the hubris that often comes with the modern,
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.440]   with the latest, the newest,
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.680]   this feeling like you figured it all out.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.680]   Everything that's been done in the past has no wisdom.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.460]   And we basically solved every problem.
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.880]   There's nothing else to be solved.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.400]   I mean, that's a defining characteristic of any age
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.760]   is like we've solved all the problems there are,
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.680]   we've had the final answers,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.880]   and our parents are all stupid.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.280]   That kind of energy, yeah.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.720]   And you have to be extremely, extremely careful with that
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:17.840]   when it talks about,
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.560]   when you think about something as complex
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.360]   as the human body or the human mind,
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.400]   you have to be very, very, very careful.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.280]   - I believe we know close to nothing.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.320]   - Yeah, exactly. - Close to nothing.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.200]   - That's-- - About anything.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.440]   - About anything. - About anything.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.440]   - That place of humility is a good place
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.000]   to start to figure it all out.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.600]   And in the end, we'll still know almost nothing.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.000]   - Yeah, I don't think we need to know.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.560]   It's like we need to see what works,
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.560]   and we need to see what works for us.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.520]   It's interesting to know.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.100]   I know on the art side,
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:53.120]   knowing how it works isn't what makes it work.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.800]   Isn't the magic of it, isn't how it works.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.800]   The magic is the magic.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:02.240]   And the magic happens in a way that's intuitive
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.920]   and accidental at times,
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.680]   or incidental where you're trying many things,
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.880]   all of a sudden something works,
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.480]   and you don't know why.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.240]   And it's okay not to know why.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.400]   It doesn't really matter why,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.360]   as long as it does the thing that you want it to do,
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.000]   whatever that is.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.720]   - Yeah, that's so weird.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.280]   When you know the components,
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.560]   you don't, you still, yeah, the magic.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.360]   What's the magic, where is the magic?
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.680]   We know the components for stuff I care about,
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.640]   artificial intelligence.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:36.520]   We know the components of a powerful computing machinery.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.320]   Where does consciousness come from?
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.480]   What is that?
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:46.480]   Where does the brilliant moments of insight come from?
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.880]   What's that?
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.000]   Even in simple games of chess, or in simple,
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.520]   where do those breakthrough ideas
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.920]   of taking the big risk that doesn't make any sense,
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.200]   and then all of a sudden it becomes something beautiful.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.680]   Yeah, we don't need to understand why.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.680]   It just happens.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.520]   - It just happens.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.680]   And often the things that end up breaking through
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.400]   don't break through in the way we thought,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.680]   or turn out to be a third iteration of something
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.120]   that we thought was an entirely different thing.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.440]   We don't know.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.200]   And I think it's, if we embrace that not knowing,
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.520]   we'll have a healthier experience going through life.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.480]   - You made a lot, it's not just music, everything.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.560]   Rearranging the chairs, the furniture as well.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.440]   You've done, like I said, the documentary,
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.040]   I guess you would say, with Paul McCartney.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.440]   And you've done a podcast yourself,
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.600]   Broken Record podcast,
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.680]   and you've done conversation too.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.920]   So what have you learned from that process
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.680]   about the art of conversation?
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.160]   And also maybe what advice would you give to this,
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.880]   to me about how, what to do with conversation?
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.600]   Like what is interesting to you about conversation?
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:03.040]   - One of the things that I like
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.720]   is to not feel like it's,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.240]   there is any stakes,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:12.320]   or that it's actually, almost that it's not happening.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.880]   Like the fact that when I came in,
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.160]   you were setting up cameras,
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.160]   made it less good for me.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.040]   I knew that that would impact the conversation
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.120]   in a negative way.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.160]   The best version of it would be
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.600]   if we didn't see the cameras,
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.480]   and we didn't see any technology,
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.840]   and we were just sitting at this table
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.960]   having a conversation.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.760]   Maybe even if we were mic'd beforehand,
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.580]   would be okay if it was necessary.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.560]   But then we were just sitting here having a conversation,
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.160]   no people in the room, nothing,
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.600]   and feeling like we're just having a conversation.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.160]   I feel like it would get closer to,
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:52.160]   closer to the relaxed feeling.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.960]   Same thing we do in the studios.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.920]   Like you've heard of red light fever,
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.760]   you know when artists get nervous
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.480]   when like they play a song great,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.680]   and then the tape starts rolling,
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.080]   and they can't play it.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.320]   And it's, we're all to some degree like that.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.120]   - When you were with Paul McCartney,
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.680]   I mean, were you cognizant of cameras?
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.800]   - We had the room black.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.960]   Everybody who was working there was dressed in black.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:19.640]   Everything was invisible.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.260]   We were lit in a way where,
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:26.360]   even though there were probably 20 people,
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.400]   between 12 and 20 people working in the room,
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.700]   within three minutes of starting the conversation,
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.640]   Paul and I were alone in the room.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.460]   So that was the feeling.
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:39.240]   On occasion you'd hear a noise, and it would be weird.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:42.280]   People, we also had, nobody was allowed to wear shoes,
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:45.040]   because it had to, we were trying to create
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.160]   this intimate space.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.480]   And I know from in the recording studio,
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:55.480]   when we're recording, if even one person is there,
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.680]   that's just watching and not working,
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.060]   you know, like there's usually,
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.000]   I'm usually there, and an engineer is there
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.440]   technically making it happen.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.520]   If anyone else is in the room, it's different,
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.440]   because then it goes from this moment
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.560]   where the person's doing a performance,
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.000]   to the sense, or where the person is
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:21.040]   feeling something internally, and we're capturing it,
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:25.320]   to the other version is, they're performing for someone.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.160]   - It's so interesting.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:29.000]   So like to push back in the alternatives here.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000]   So one, about the third person,
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.760]   not to make people self-conscious,
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.160]   but I find that I'm so torn on that,
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.100]   'cause sometimes when that person,
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.840]   so Evan is in the room here,
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:42.960]   he's been in the room before,
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.520]   he's a huge fan of yours, by the way.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.520]   So he'll nod, yeah, yeah, he'll get excited.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.800]   He's like, and you can see that nodding,
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.760]   and for some reason for me, it's like, yeah,
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.020]   you get it, like, yeah, you get excited together.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.760]   I mean, that third person can be like a really special,
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.600]   so having an audience, when it's a friend,
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.440]   or somebody that has that love in them.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.720]   - It depends on the performer.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.560]   It's all positive, yeah.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:17.280]   Yeah, some people really thrive in front of an audience.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.840]   - And you're saying you like that simple intimacy
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.680]   of everything just evades.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.440]   - Well, I like the reality of it not being,
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.760]   I want it to be as far from a performance as possible.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.600]   - Got it.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.660]   - And if someone, I'll tell you a story,
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:33.520]   a story that just happened, and it was viewed as kind of a,
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.080]   it seemed uncool in the moment
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.180]   to the person that it happened to.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:38.460]   It wasn't at all.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.120]   We were recording the new "Chili Peppers" album,
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.560]   which is coming out, I think, any day now.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.600]   Like, I don't know what today's date is,
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.080]   but within the next, maybe by the time this airs,
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.720]   it will be out.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:55.360]   And the band was playing in the studio,
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.720]   and it was ripping 'cause they're incredible.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.720]   And one of the members walked through the control room
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.300]   after a particularly great performance,
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:12.740]   and the engineer said, "Wow, that solo's really great."
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:16.560]   And the person who heard this said,
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.980]   "Please don't say that," and walked away.
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:23.940]   It's like, it was not, it just changed
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:27.140]   this feeling of we're in this place
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.100]   where we're doing this thing,
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.140]   and there is no outside world.
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:33.100]   You know, we're doing this for us.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.720]   We're going as deep as we can for us.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:38.280]   And as soon as there's an acknowledgement to someone else,
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.280]   in a way, it breaks the concentration of being inside of it.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.980]   - That's so well told.
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:51.100]   But something about saying, "Wow, that solo's great,"
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:55.140]   is shows the, it reminds you that there's an outside world,
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.920]   but I feel like there's a way to enter the inside world
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.220]   as an audience.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:02.660]   So you just have to do that.
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:04.300]   (laughing)
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.460]   So it matters what you say.
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.740]   It matters how you look.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.940]   It matters, so there's these generic compliments,
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.940]   not generic, but they sound in the way
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:18.020]   an outside world would interact,
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.380]   as opposed to in that creative thing
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:22.980]   where you're dancing around the fire together or something.
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:23.820]   - There's actually, I can tell you,
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.980]   there's another interesting one that happened to me,
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.900]   and I didn't know this until I saw the film of it,
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.940]   which was a strange one.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.400]   We were recording with the Avett brothers,
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.720]   and the song was called "No Hard Feelings,"
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.460]   and it was this recording of "No Hard Feelings."
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:44.040]   (gentle music)

[01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:00.860]   with more like so much more sort of flavor to the voice.
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:04.260]   He's go so many different places.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:07.540]   It's cool when it's like acappella just mostly him.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.540]   You could do like "Hallelujah"
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:11.860]   the Jeff Buckley way I could tell.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:12.700]   It's incredible.
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:14.540]   That's an incredible song.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.980]   Is this a new record?
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.740]   - This was, I don't know, four or five years ago,
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.580]   something like that.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:22.820]   But what happened with this, that happened.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:26.940]   And I mean, they're great and it's always good.
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:29.100]   But that performance in that moment
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:32.020]   was felt like the sky opened up.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:32.860]   It was unbelievable.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:33.900]   - But this was a single take?
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:35.340]   - This was a single take.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:36.180]   - Oh, wow.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.020]   - That was just like--
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:37.840]   - That was incredible.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:38.680]   Yeah, that was perfect.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.700]   That was perfect, yeah.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:44.700]   - When it ended, I said, "Great, what do you wanna do next?"
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:50.340]   And they said, "We just need a few minutes."
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.060]   And they walked out and that's all I know.
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:54.940]   It's like, okay, I'm laying down,
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:56.940]   waiting until they're ready to start again.
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.100]   And in the film, there was a film made
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:01.500]   of the sessions of this.
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.620]   They went out and they're like,
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:03.620]   what was that like?
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:06.900]   Like, didn't he get what just happened?
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:11.700]   Like, because it was so heavy.
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.780]   - Yeah.
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:17.780]   - And it was just as heavy for me.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:20.380]   And in the spirit of we're here to make
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:22.420]   the most great stuff we can,
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:24.420]   we're not gonna like open champagne.
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:27.180]   Like, that's not, it's like, great,
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:28.380]   what do you wanna do next?
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:33.380]   It's like, let's not revel in this.
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:37.380]   But they took it as like,
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.500]   this guy just like doesn't even understand
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.340]   what we're doing.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:42.540]   (laughing)
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.300]   But I had no idea until I saw the film.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.140]   - That's funny.
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:46.700]   - Whoa, that was the reaction.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:48.580]   - Yeah, but I think your response
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.540]   is the right risk to take, right?
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:54.180]   'Cause it's the celebration at the end of a,
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.740]   you wanna keep like, people celebrate too early.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.860]   - Yes, great.
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.180]   And now let's use that momentum.
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.380]   We're in the zone.
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:04.700]   What's next?
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:05.940]   - Yeah.
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.780]   But you, yourself in conversation.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:12.260]   So you said that you wanna create this,
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:13.780]   would you use the word intimacy?
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:16.300]   Like, is it to create, or just the most real?
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.140]   Like there's no cameras, there's no mics.
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:21.740]   - I would say a place where you're comfortable to be naked.
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:25.860]   You know, a place where you can be your most vulnerable
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.620]   without questioning it.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:32.100]   You wanna really be able to let your guard down
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.060]   and to, you know, if you wanna start crying
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:37.140]   when you're singing, whatever it is, whatever it is.
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.420]   And it's hard to get to that place.
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.500]   And again, just the idea of someone, you know,
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:42.940]   like, hey, that was good.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:46.860]   That could take you right out of that going in,
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:47.940]   you know, going in.
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:51.140]   - It's so interesting to think about how to achieve that
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.300]   and still have mics.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:54.180]   - Yeah.
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:55.020]   - That.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:59.220]   - It's hard, it's harder, it's harder.
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.260]   - Some of it is space,
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.620]   some of it is raw conversational skill.
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:07.340]   Like there's something about certain,
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.540]   well, some of that is also just like,
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.740]   you have that, as I'm sure you are,
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:14.620]   there's a legend to Rick Rubin.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:16.980]   And there's like my now friend Joe Rogan,
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:18.540]   there's a legend to him.
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.380]   And when you show up into Joe Rogan's studio,
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.860]   the legend creates an aura.
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:28.660]   And he, I think, subconsciously or consciously uses it.
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:34.380]   To like, this is somehow, it's nervous, nervous, nervous.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.140]   And then you realize, oh, he's just human or something.
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:40.420]   There's a relief.
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:43.620]   And then, yeah, you could be yourself.
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:46.420]   And that, so it's that nervousness, nervousness, nervousness
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:48.900]   and it's like, oh, it's not that,
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:51.940]   this legend is just a human and it's just, it's normal.
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.540]   So I don't know how that's done.
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.500]   But it's so interesting to think about how that's,
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:00.900]   because I forget recording,
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:02.980]   I just enjoy it when it's real.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:05.460]   Like this microphone gives us an excuse
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.980]   to connect on a human level and forget,
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:09.620]   and nobody's listening, it doesn't matter.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.660]   - I would say I felt maybe in the last 15 minutes,
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.740]   I was less aware of anybody else being in the room
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:16.100]   or any equipment here.
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.740]   - Yeah. - But it took that long.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.700]   - That's so interesting.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.340]   I didn't have that at all.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:25.420]   All I had, I mean, the wind calmed down outside,
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.300]   but there was a wind before.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:29.860]   And there's something about the wind,
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:30.940]   that you can think of it
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:33.100]   from an audio engineering perspective.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.580]   Like, oh, I wonder if the wind creates sound
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:36.860]   or whatever that you hear.
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:39.460]   But I was thinking like, none of this matters.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:41.260]   (laughing)
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:46.220]   Like the wind is like nature will be here before us,
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:49.460]   after us, and all of this will be dead and forgotten.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.100]   That's what the wind was reminding me of.
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:52.980]   It's almost like laughing at the fact
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:56.700]   that we could even consider ourselves important enough
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:01.540]   to put on clothes and talk.
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:03.900]   You love it, you love talking.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.700]   You love the podcast and just that.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.060]   Why did you dive into that?
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:09.900]   Like why?
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:13.820]   - It was a strange occurrence.
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:16.540]   My friend Malcolm said he wanted to start doing a podcast
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:18.140]   about music and asked if I would do it with him.
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:19.780]   He's like, I like Malcolm.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.260]   And I thought it would be more like his podcast,
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.780]   which is, it's not an interview podcast.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.660]   I thought it was gonna be telling stories
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:32.660]   in the music world using audio stories.
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:37.060]   And then it just started being interviews.
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:39.020]   Not again, it wasn't intentional,
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:42.300]   just started that way and ended up being that.
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.300]   But I love it.
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.940]   And I love both because I get to talk to people
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:48.900]   that I don't know, but also when I get to talk to people
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:51.140]   that I know and ask them about things
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.580]   that we would never talk about ever.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.540]   I don't know the origin stories of any of the people,
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.100]   any of my friends.
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.860]   So to get to hear their perspective,
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.740]   another like relating to Chili Peppers,
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:04.060]   their album's coming out now.
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:08.940]   I interviewed all four members of the band individually.
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:13.780]   I interviewed John and midway through Anthony came in
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.300]   and then I interviewed Flea separately
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:17.340]   and I interviewed Chad separately.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:19.220]   And it was fascinating.
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:22.580]   I know them for 30 years and I learned a tremendous amount
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:25.340]   because you don't ask people about themselves
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:30.340]   when you're just workmates or friends.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:33.340]   I do this sometimes, I'll just set up my microphones
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:36.060]   and I'll record a thing for private consumption
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:38.100]   from with friends or loved ones.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:38.940]   - Yeah. - It's fascinating.
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:39.780]   - Good idea.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:42.460]   - 'Cause you get to ask those ridiculous questions.
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:44.060]   First of all, about life, about the future,
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:48.460]   about the past, about little fears and the things you miss.
[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:51.200]   And yeah, there's something people just reveal.
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.700]   First loves, all those kinds of things.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.100]   Your view on love, your view on,
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.700]   and those are things don't come up in regular conversations.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.100]   It's so nice that that's something about,
[01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:06.060]   see, that's the pushback.
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:07.540]   There's something about this microphone
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:10.300]   or maybe it's just the deliberate nature of sitting down
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.780]   and let's just talk.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:16.460]   There is something about the microphone that for me thinks,
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.000]   just same with the suit.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.260]   I'm gonna take this moment seriously.
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:23.260]   I've long forgotten that anyone is listening.
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:27.220]   I'm gonna try to really listen to another human,
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:32.220]   first of all, and to also ask the questions
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:35.180]   that are really interesting.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:38.060]   I feel like when I talk to normal people out on the street,
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:40.940]   I'm not allowed to ask anything.
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:44.460]   I'm allowed to ask only the more generic things.
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:46.420]   - I think you can ask anything.
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:47.980]   - I'm starting to think that.
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:50.020]   - I think you're allowed to ask anything.
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:54.300]   - I think you're allowed to basically do anything,
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:55.980]   especially in Texas.
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:57.460]   - Yeah, I think it's okay to ask people
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:00.220]   and I think people like it when you ask them.
[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:05.280]   People like to be seen and like to show who they are.
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:08.100]   - As the wind blows again,
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.540]   do you have advice for young people?
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:14.880]   You have a fascinating life journey.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:19.220]   Is there advice you can give to people in high school
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:24.220]   and college about how to have a life like yours
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.340]   in whatever pursuit in terms of,
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:32.740]   success is such a silly word,
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:37.740]   but just find success or maybe happiness in career
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:40.580]   or just in life in general?
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:43.580]   - Yeah, the only advice I would have
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:46.220]   would be to not listen to anyone
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:50.140]   and to do what you love and to make things that you love,
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:53.260]   whatever it is, make your favorite things.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:54.980]   Be the audience, you be the audience.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.900]   Make the thing for you, the audience.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:02.900]   And it doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.980]   and if you have to get a job to support yourself
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:07.140]   so that you can make your art, that's fine.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:10.220]   You can't make art for someone else,
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:12.100]   you can't make art with someone else in mind,
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.460]   I don't believe, I don't believe it can be good.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.500]   - So what does success feel like?
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:21.500]   Are you grateful, are you proud of the work
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.780]   you've done in the past
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:26.540]   or is there some engine of constant dissatisfaction,
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:30.060]   like self-criticism of I could have done better?
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:33.540]   - No, I'm pleased with the work that we did,
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:36.020]   excited to keep working, it's fun.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.780]   I don't know what else I would do with myself
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:42.060]   'cause I like making things, it's fun.
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.700]   I feel like it's my reason to be on the planet
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.900]   so I just keep doing it.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:50.540]   - Whatever ideas are actually coming from elsewhere
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:54.540]   and are using your mind as a temporary vehicle,
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.620]   that's their purpose to be on this planet.
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.780]   Your purpose is to procreate and not die
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:05.660]   and eat regularly enough such that the brain is alive,
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.180]   it's a biological purpose.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:09.980]   - Yeah, and anything I can do to keep the channel open
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:12.180]   to allow what wants to come through to come through,
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:15.380]   I'm a willing channel.
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.860]   - It's so interesting 'cause I'm extremely self-critical
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:21.300]   so you don't have that self-criticism harsh,
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:25.140]   like this could have been better, this--
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:27.940]   - If it could have been better, I would keep working on it.
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:32.180]   It's like if it could be better, it's not done.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:37.860]   - So when it's done, it's done.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.940]   - Well, it's the best it can be.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:43.540]   I've done everything I can to make it the best it can be
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:45.660]   and I can't do more than that
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.300]   so there's nothing to be critical of.
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:51.980]   I did my very, if you always give all of yourself
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:54.820]   and do your best, which you're capable of doing,
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.820]   I'm not suggesting that you're capable
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.500]   of doing more than you can do,
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.180]   but whatever it is that you can do,
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:03.420]   if you've given all of yourself to it,
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:07.420]   you've done your best, where could there be regret?
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:11.500]   - Yeah, there could be, you re-listen to an album,
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:14.020]   you re-listen to anything you've created
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:17.860]   and think, oh, there's so many interesting ideas missed.
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:19.860]   - It's fine though, but that was that moment.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:22.820]   It's like everything is like a,
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:25.060]   it's almost like a diary entry.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:28.980]   Everything we make is a reflection of a moment in time,
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.220]   a window in time.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.820]   Could be a day, it could be a year,
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:37.180]   it could be whatever window you decide that it is.
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:40.860]   But if you give it all of yourself
[01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:42.740]   and you know if you're not interested
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:46.180]   in working on it anymore, it's done.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:47.620]   Now you may decide it's not good enough
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:50.580]   to share with people and that's fine,
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:51.980]   but if it's good enough to share with people,
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:54.580]   there's no regret looking back.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:58.500]   - That's funny, 'cause like think of it as a diary entry.
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:01.580]   It's hard to look back at a diary entry and say, you know--
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.180]   - I did it wrong. - I did it wrong.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:04.260]   - It's impossible.
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:09.700]   - Yeah, and even if it's read by 100 people,
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:11.420]   a thousand people, a million people,
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:14.340]   it's just a diary entry. - Doesn't matter.
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:17.480]   - Speaking of doesn't matter, this life is finite.
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:22.620]   All of us, even recruitment, will be forgotten one day.
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:25.420]   Do you think about your mortality--
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:27.420]   - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow, yes.
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:33.700]   Do you think about the finiteness of this thing?
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.660]   Do you think about mortality, about your mortality?
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:37.900]   Does it make any sense to you?
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:38.980]   Do you think about death?
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:40.180]   Are you afraid of death?
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:44.380]   - I don't think about it very much.
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:45.260]   - Are you afraid?
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:48.620]   - I don't think I'm afraid.
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:50.860]   I mean, I don't wanna die,
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:53.740]   but I know that that's in the cards,
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.740]   and when it happens, it happens.
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.000]   - Your nature of not wanting to die is kinda like,
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.260]   you don't wanna go to a shitty restaurant.
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.620]   You'd like to go to a nicer one.
[01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:03.860]   So it's just a preference thing.
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.860]   - Well, I wanna keep living
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.780]   because I wanna do what I like to do.
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:11.200]   So whatever, now who knows?
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.000]   Whatever comes next may be even better.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.180]   Maybe we're, I don't know.
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:20.680]   I can't, I haven't experienced it yet, so who knows?
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:23.220]   - What do you think happens after we die?
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:26.540]   - I believe we go on in some capacity.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:27.540]   I don't know what that means,
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:30.780]   but in the same way that everything recycles,
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:32.620]   everything comes around.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:37.180]   I don't know why we would be different.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.220]   - In some way.
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:39.060]   - In some way.
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:39.940]   I don't know what that way is,
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:42.620]   and I don't know that it's in the same being,
[01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:47.140]   or in the same grouping of information, whatever that is.
[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:49.620]   But the thing that makes us us,
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:52.960]   that information, I imagine, goes on.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:55.100]   - Yes, it does seem like our world here,
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.860]   at least on Earth, has a memory.
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:00.900]   And just like history, it kinda rhymes.
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:05.900]   It brings back creations of the past and riffs on them,
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:07.980]   improvises on top of them,
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:11.420]   and in that way, humanity propagates.
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:12.700]   - I mean, you see it with garbage.
[02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:15.540]   You see the mountains of garbage.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.140]   It's like it doesn't really go anywhere.
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:19.540]   Even when it breaks up, it disintegrates,
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:22.140]   but it's never really gone.
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.740]   Same.
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:27.020]   - Is there anything in this world you're afraid of?
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.700]   - A lot of things.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:29.540]   - But not death.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:33.180]   - I mean, I don't know.
[02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:34.020]   I don't know.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:35.340]   - What are you afraid of?
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:36.860]   - Death is more of a question mark.
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:38.980]   Again, I'm not in any--
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:39.820]   - To be answered.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:42.940]   - Yeah, I'm not in any hurry for that to happen,
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.700]   but it will happen, and when it does,
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.380]   we get to experience what that is.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:50.220]   - Well, okay, then the big question mark,
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:52.380]   what's the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:55.000]   It's the meaning of life, Rick Rubin.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.700]   - Putting my name on it makes it harder to answer.
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:03.340]   - It's just a diary entry, like we said.
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:04.180]   - It's true, it's true.
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:05.860]   - You will get a different answer tomorrow.
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:07.540]   Let's see, what's the meaning of life today?
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.800]   - Late and later today.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:14.220]   It could be, so for people who don't know,
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:18.180]   we were maybe thinking of maybe meeting in Austin,
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:21.300]   have some barbecue, and now we're in the middle of nowhere
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:26.300]   in beautiful West Texas, and this is basically
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:31.340]   a glorified delivery of barbecue, of my favorite barbecue,
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:34.420]   maybe one of your top favorite barbecues,
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.620]   to one of my favorite humans,
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:38.420]   so we get to eat some barbecue today.
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:39.660]   Maybe that's the meaning.
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:44.220]   Do you have something bigger than barbecue?
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:45.460]   - Barbecue's pretty big.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.300]   (Lex laughing)
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:47.140]   Barbecue's pretty good.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:49.140]   - Where's your love for barbecue come from, by the way?
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:49.980]   Do you, is this--
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:53.760]   - Well, I was a vegan for 20-something years,
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.260]   and once I found my way back into eating meat,
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:01.780]   I think barbecue's my favorite of any of the things
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:03.800]   that I didn't eat for so long.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:09.340]   - I have to ask you, I almost forgot.
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:13.540]   So there's an SNL skit with Will Ferrell that he wrote
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:16.180]   about "Don't Fear the Reaper,"
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:19.860]   where it's Bruce Dickinson as the producer.
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:21.740]   I always think about you when I see that skit.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.820]   I don't know why, people should definitely watch it,
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:27.980]   and he demands more cowbell into the mix,
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:29.660]   and the whole band,
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:31.260]   this is how I imagine people interact with you.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.660]   The whole band is really impressed.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.580]   We get to work with the great Bruce Dickinson,
[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:37.980]   and then it's played by Christopher Walken,
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:41.140]   and he says, "Fellas, fellas,
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:44.540]   I put on my pants one leg at a time,
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.380]   just like the rest of you,
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:49.820]   but once my pants are on, I make gold records."
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:50.860]   (Lex laughing)
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:54.460]   And I just, and then the whole skit continues,
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:56.140]   and he wants to add more and more cowbell,
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:58.260]   and Will Ferrell said he wrote that skit
[02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:00.620]   'cause he always heard the song "Don't Fear the Reaper,"
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:02.220]   and there's a distant cowbell.
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:04.060]   It's very light in the mix,
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:09.060]   and he's like, "I wonder what the story of that cowbell is.
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.180]   Like, if we just look at that one layer,
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:13.300]   who's that guy that was in there?"
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:14.900]   - That's me.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:18.220]   - So is that basically exactly how your life is,
[02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:20.620]   is Bruce Dickinson from the cowbell?
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:22.520]   I don't know if you've seen that skit.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:25.460]   - I don't think it's like that.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.540]   - It's not, okay, all right.
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.980]   I'm just gonna pretend then.
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:32.060]   Rick, this is a huge honor that you sit with me.
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:37.060]   I mean, what can I say about how incredible of a human you are?
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:40.100]   You truly are out of this world,
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:42.020]   and thank you so much for talking today.
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:42.980]   - I'm a great fan.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.780]   I'm so happy that you agreed to do this with me.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:49.300]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:50.460]   with Rick Rubin.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:51.740]   To support this podcast,
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:54.540]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.580]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:58.580]   from Albert Einstein.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:01.220]   Imagination is everything.
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:04.120]   It is the preview of life's coming attractions.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:07.880]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:10.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:13.040]   (upbeat music)
