[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   What I think it can be useful for people to understand is that many things will spike
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.800]   cortisol throughout the day, stress, cold water, exercise, but the idea is that it comes
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.060]   down to baseline or near baseline rather quickly.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.340]   One of the worst situations as you pointed out is when the highest level of cortisol
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.940]   is consistently shifted to the afternoon period.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.040]   In fact, that's a pretty reliable signature of certain forms of depression.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   This is work by my colleague David Spiegel at Stanford Psychiatry and the great Bob Sapolsky,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.320]   Robert Sapolsky of Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, Behave, et cetera, and Fame, lots of popular
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   books there.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.600]   I think that if people are trying to regulate their cortisol and they just understand that
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.440]   basic contour that the baseline should rise pretty quickly after one rises in the morning,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.720]   so it's easy to remember, rise, rise, rise out of bed and rise cortisol with light, bright
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.000]   light, with exercise, with caffeine, these things will all increase cortisol.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.480]   And then across the day, it's normal for cortisol to spike, but then to use some of the down
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.880]   regulation methods that you described, in particular the breathing methods and exercise
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.920]   itself, as the case may be.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.680]   But then to really pay attention to how much psychological and physical stress is occurring
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.600]   in the six hours or so or eight hours prior to sleep, does that seem like a good broad
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.800]   contour of how to have a healthy pattern of cortisol release?
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   Because you actually want the cortisol to reduce inflammation and initiate or participate
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.120]   in the recovery process.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.060]   You will not see any progress from exercise training without a large spike in cortisol.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.400]   It is critically important when we think of phrases like cortisol, inflammation, stress,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.320]   this is not bad.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.000]   Physiology is not personified, right?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.760]   Things don't hate you in the body, right?
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.440]   It's all, it's not good and bad.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.760]   They just are.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.520]   The more you try to suppress cortisol, the more you suppress adaptation.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.720]   What you want is exactly what you mentioned, large spikes met with large quick recovery.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.080]   And you want to do that throughout the day and get that hormetic stressor.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.640]   This is, so going back to your ashwagandha and rhodiola issue, I think it would be very
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.720]   short-sighted for people to do that as this is a prophylactic.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   If you blunt cortisol, you're going to cause immunosuppressant.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400]   - Especially early in the day.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   - Totally.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.320]   - Taking ashwagandha before going to train is counterproductive.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   - Yeah.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.680]   We do not just, this is not a baseline part of our foundational package, right?
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.600]   If you go look at the athlete foundations or the athlete resilience protocols I've put
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.800]   together, you're not going to see these things in there for that specific reason.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.740]   Any form of cortisol regulation needs to be done strategically.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.960]   If you are excessively high and we're bringing you back down to normative values at the right
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   time, then great.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.200]   If you're normal though, then taking you down lower than that is actually problematic.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.240]   The same thing is actually true since we're here for oxidative stress, foreign information,
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   antioxidant use.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   We mentioned I think earlier about taking vitamin C and vitamin E post-exercise will
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.540]   actually blunt adaptations or at least it has the potential to do so.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.540]   Same thing, right?
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.640]   If you're modulating this response just because and you have not done so because of actually
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.920]   biological testing that indicated you needed to do such, then you actually may be making
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   things worse.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.520]   We see this constantly with people who take a number of supplements and substances for
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.280]   sleep and then they wake up the next morning groggy and your cortisol is suppressed.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   Okay, great.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.560]   Then they take something for stimulation and then the rest of the day they're trying to
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   reduce.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   Then you're in this nasty cycle.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.320]   Instead of just getting out of the way and letting cortisol do what it's supposed to
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.360]   do and then making sure again you're teaching it.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.080]   So this is actually a coachable response.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.000]   You can coach your own body to go down in the later part of the day and go up in the
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   earlier part of the day.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.500]   You want to make sure that you are driving that train with intent and so again to reiterate,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.920]   if you don't need that, you shouldn't do it.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.480]   If you don't need to lower cortisol, you shouldn't walk around doing it.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   You're just going to suppress the state even far and this is what's needed.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.880]   This is needed for anabolic response, so you're not going to grow muscle if cortisol is not
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   spiked.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.200]   It's going to compromise it rather.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.640]   So you want to be intentional with these practices, especially in the form of supplementation.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.840]   Be very, very intentional.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.680]   I've heard it said that carbohydrates, in particular starchy carbohydrates, can inhibit
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:43.240]   cortisol and this could be through the tryptophan amino acid related pathway.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.820]   It ratchets up to serotonin release.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.820]   Probably some other things too.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.960]   I mean the idea that carbohydrates just stimulate serotonin is a little bit overly simplistic.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.720]   >>COREY: No, those cellular mechanisms, AMPK going up and immediately turning on there,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720]   yeah.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   >>AJ: Right.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.280]   So I think we've all experienced this.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   We're stressed.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   We're stressed.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.080]   It doesn't necessarily even have to be highly processed, fatty carbohydrates like potato
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.340]   chips and dip or these kinds of things.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.400]   It can also be a bowl of rice, a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of pasta, which here I'm not trying
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.600]   to demonize carbohydrates.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.640]   I do ingest carbohydrates minimally or non-processed carbohydrates most of the time, but not all
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.560]   the time.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.040]   They have a fairly potent effect on lowering stress and perceived stress and even quality
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.480]   of sleep, which is not to say that somebody has to load up on them like crazy unless their
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.800]   glycogen is really depleted.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.720]   We talked a lot about this in the endurance episode.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.600]   I know we'll touch on it more in the nutrition supplementation episode.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.800]   But in thinking about the relationship between carbohydrates and cortisol and what we've
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.760]   just been talking about in terms of cortisol as being vitally important for the adaptation
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   trigger or triggering adaptation, it's probably a better way to put it, but that it can blunt
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.000]   cortisol taken post-training or maybe in the evening before sleep.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.120]   What are some of the basic ways that one can think about and maybe use carbohydrates in
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:21.100]   specific ways in order to, let's say, control cortisol rather than quash cortisol?
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.720]   You actually have alluded to it a number of times already.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.480]   We oftentimes will give people a lot of carbohydrates at night for some of these reasons.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.120]   You're going to feel fantastic.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.200]   A lot of people it helps you sleep, both get to sleep and stay asleep, sleep quality.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.380]   You talked about specifically, remember, think about it this way, cortisol at its core is
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.360]   an energy signaling molecule.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.160]   It says we are in the need for energy.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.560]   Great.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   Epinephrine is the same way.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.800]   You'll start seeing, for example, cortisol will liberate free fatty acids, put them in
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.320]   the bloodstream, get you prepared to do something.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   The problem is if it's continually elevated throughout the day with no down regulation,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.840]   we start running into issues, right?
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.680]   So again, this is the differentiation between, "Oh, my cortisol is slightly elevated all
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.480]   day," versus, "I had a really big spike after training, I had a really big spike after a
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.400]   breath protocol, et cetera, and then it went back down."
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.840]   So that being said, if you then ingest carbohydrates, it is quick to see the signal, we have nutrients,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.240]   we have energy, again, specifically carbohydrates, therefore cortisol can sort of go back down.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.960]   You don't need to be liberating free fatty acids and preparing the need for fuel.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.120]   So you can help yourself go to sleep for many, as you pointed out, many mechanisms actually
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.180]   of why carbohydrates will help you sleep at night for some, not all people, but some.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.200]   That would be one of the relationships it has with cortisol.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:53.520]   [music]
