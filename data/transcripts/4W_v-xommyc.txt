[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.480]   the book of the prophet Jeremiah, the 17th chapter and the 15th verse.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.280]   The 15th verse in the 17th chapter of the book of the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:34.160]   "Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come, or let it come now."
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.720]   Now it seems to me, as I indicated last Sunday evening, that if we are to catch the full
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.320]   significance and meaning of this statement, we must take it in connection with the previous
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   verse, verse 14.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.560]   There we listen to the prophet Jeremiah himself crying out unto the Lord and saying, "Heal
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   me, O Lord, and I shall be healed. Save me, and I shall be saved. For thou art my praise."
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.120]   That's my position, he seems to say. What is their position? Well, it's this.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:24.240]   "Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come."
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.840]   In other words, in these two verses together, we have the end and the closing of this particular
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.000]   message which the prophet Jeremiah was given by God to deliver to his people.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.560]   It starts, you remember, at verse 5, "Thus saith the Lord," and the message follows.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.160]   And here, in a sense, the real message ends, because from there on the prophet just continues
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.580]   to offer up a very personal plea for himself that God would save him from the injustice
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.120]   and the unfairness of his fellow countrymen who misunderstood him so grievously, and that
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.800]   God would vindicate him and his ministry. So that I say that here, in a sense, the actual
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.920]   burden, the message itself, really finishes. And it finishes, of course, on this note.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.560]   It reminds us that there are only two possible ultimate positions for us all to occupy. We
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   are all of us either believers or else we are unbelievers.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.760]   Now, the Bible is not interested in any other categories whatsoever. I know that the world
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.120]   is divided up in many other ways, and people attach very great significance to these other
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.360]   divisions and distinctions. Wealthy and poor, great and small, they divide us up according
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.520]   to the color of our skin, the social stratum to which we belong, whether we are learned
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.240]   and big or ignorant, and so on and so forth. All right, but I am saying that from the standpoint
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:25.040]   of the Bible, all those distinctions are utterly irrelevant. Indeed, they are tragically irrelevant,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.520]   because in the last analysis there is only this one division and distinction. The Bible
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.280]   only wants to know one thing about everybody, and that is this, "Are you a believer or
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.880]   are you an unbeliever? Are you one of God's people or are you not one of God's people?
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.880]   Are you a Christian or are you not a Christian?"
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.560]   Now that is the great question that the Bible goes on putting from the very beginning to
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.960]   the very end. You see, it starts way back at the beginning in the book of Genesis. The
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.920]   first man and woman had two sons. One is called Abel, the other is called Cain. And there
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.720]   you have at once believer and unbeliever. The distinction started at the beginning.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.520]   And if you go right through the book to the book of Revelations, you will find the same
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.880]   thing. You will find a wonderful description of the glory of God's people, then we are
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:33.640]   told, outside of dogs and sorcerers and adulterers and all these others who are unbelievers.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   Now as you go right through, you will find it is always that. Some believed, some did
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.080]   not believe. Some went after him, some rejected him. The house is either on the rock or else
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.760]   on the sand. You either enter by the straight gate or by the wide gate. It is always that,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.240]   either this or that, one or the other, and there is no other possible position.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.760]   Very well then, this is surely something very fundamental. We are all of us in one of these
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.320]   two relationships, in one of these two positions. What is it that determines it? What is it
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.480]   that decides it? How may we know for certain which of these two positions is the one to
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   which we belong? Well now, unfortunately the answer is given to us here in this verse at
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.960]   the very end as it was given at the very beginning. The one thing that determines our position
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:43.560]   is our attitude to the word of the Lord. "Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.640]   Lord?" That's it. It's their attitude to that that proclaims what they are. You notice
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   that we started many Sunday nights ago with the same thing. "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.320]   It starts with the word of the Lord. It ends with the word of the Lord. The whole thing
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:11.040]   is our attitude to the word of the Lord. And it is tonight again the one thing that determines
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.840]   precisely where we stand and what our eternal future is to be.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.440]   Now as regards the word of Jeremiah in its local and temporary application, the thing
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.760]   is perfectly clear. I have reminded you of it every Sunday night that we have considered
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:40.480]   this great passage. "Here are the children of Israel in trouble, things going from bad
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:48.520]   to worse, the enemy attacking at the very gates. Is it all hopeless? Well, no, there
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.600]   is still a possibility. God has sent his prophets to them one after another." He is still sending
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:07.960]   his prophet to them in Jeremiah. God goes on speaking until the 59th second of the 11th
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:16.280]   chapter. He goes on to the very last moment. Still there is hope. Yes, but it is only if
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.960]   they listen to the message of God. So God gave the message to Jeremiah and told him
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.560]   to go to the people and to put it before them. "Thus saith the Lord." And the message
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.480]   was that they should realize that their calamities had come upon them and would increase because
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:44.160]   of their sin, because of their rebellion against God, because of their disobedience. It was
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.000]   the only cause of their trouble. And that indicated the only way of relief and of deliverance
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.080]   if they acknowledged it and if they confessed it, if they repented and turned back to God
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.760]   with a whole and undivided heart, even now he would spare them and he would deliver them.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:11.640]   But if they did not, calamity would overwhelm them. The enemy would come in and destroy
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.440]   their city and reduce it to a heap of rubble and of ruins, and they would be carried away
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.280]   to the captivity of the land of Babylon by these Chaldeans. That is the message. "Thus
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:30.200]   saith the Lord." That is the word of the Lord, an indication of the position, a warning,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:43.480]   an appeal, an offer. And their whole circumstance depends entirely upon their response to that.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.400]   In the case of Jeremiah we have seen it, "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed. Save me
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:58.560]   and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise." But Jeremiah was a very lone vice. The crowd
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.480]   of false prophets were on the other side and they carried the people with them. And they
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:13.680]   said, "Where is this word of the Lord? Let it come." You see the two responses.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:23.200]   Now that, as I have been indicating, is a very perfect statement of the position of
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.560]   everybody in this world tonight with regard to the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:38.920]   Christ, which we have in the New Testament. May I put it simply and plainly? The thing
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.320]   that determines whether we are Christians or not, the thing that determines whether
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:56.880]   we are right with God or not, is still this one thing, our response, our reaction to the
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:07.800]   word of God, to the message of God in Jesus Christ, this message of salvation.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.880]   May I put it once again, lest there may be somebody who still is harboring the false
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.760]   notions? What determines whether we are Christians or not and whether we are right with God or
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.960]   not is not our life in the first instance. Life matters tremendously, but it is not the
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.760]   life you live that determines whether you are a Christian or whether you are going to
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:36.240]   be with God beyond death and the grave. It is not the life you live, neither is it your
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:43.280]   feelings. Feelings are essential, but nice, happy, comfortable feelings do not prove that
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.920]   you are a Christian. They may be very, very deceiving. We have seen already that the heart
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.440]   is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, that people may think they are all
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   right and say, "Lord, Lord," but he will say, "I never knew you. Depart from me,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:09.000]   ye that work iniquity." And may I add that it is not experiences either that decide whether
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.080]   we are Christians or not and right with God. There are people who can tell us about marvellous
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.040]   experiences about having seen great lights and some great dramatic change in their lives.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.600]   They say, "I am absolutely different. I have been delivered from certain sins that
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.960]   always got me down. Look at me now, how happy and radiant I am. A marvellous experience."
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.120]   Well let me say again that experience is essential and that no man can be a Christian without
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:44.720]   experiencing the grace and the power of God. But if you think that a change in your life
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.640]   or an experience which is thrilling proves that you are a Christian, you may again be
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:12:00.880]   the victim of a delusion of Satan. There are false experiences. There are spurious experiences.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   The devil can give people experiences and they can be very joyous and very happy experiences.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.080]   It is not experience that determines. I say that what determines where we are and how
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:21.840]   we stand tonight is our response, our reaction to the word of the Lord and nothing else.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.160]   I know people who can testify to the most astounding experiences by way of being made
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.640]   happy and joyful, but they do not believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. They
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.960]   do not believe in his atoning sacrificial death. They do not believe in the person of
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:45.080]   the Holy Spirit. Well, very well, I am not interested in their experiences. Their experiences
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.160]   are not Christian. You cannot be a Christian unless you believe the word of the Lord. This
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:57.720]   is the determining thing and nothing else. Another thing I would add is this. It is not
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:05.120]   our activities either that prove that we are Christian. You can be a very busy church worker
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.760]   and not be a Christian. You can be tremendously interested in religion and still not be a
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.920]   Christian. It is not our activity. It is not what we do that decides it. It is what we
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.000]   make of this word of the Lord that comes to us. There are two possibilities. And though
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.200]   I may work and give my body to be burned, as Paul puts it, and give all my goods to
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   the poor, I may do all that, but if I have not believed and submitted to this word, it
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.400]   will avail me nothing and I am not a Christian. And I am wrong in the sight of God. Very well,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:49.200]   then, I say this is the first and the great thing. This is the only test.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:58.880]   Thus saith the Lord. What has he said? What is his message? Well, it is still in its essence
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:06.400]   the same as the message of Jeremiah to his contemporaries. The word of the Lord to men
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.520]   and women today is still first and foremost a warning. It is still the message of the
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:19.520]   law. It is still the holiness of God. It is still the Ten Commandments. They have not
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.280]   been abrogated. Though men and women spit upon them and laugh at them, they are gods
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:31.720]   and they are still operative and they will never be put aside. That is the message of
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.400]   the Lord. That is the word of the Lord still. He comes to the human race and says, "I
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:46.800]   have made you for myself. I want you for myself. I have asked for your obedience. I say, 'Be
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:58.360]   ye holy for I am holy.' Are you holy?" It is still a proclamation of his law. It
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.160]   is still a reminder that his law is going to be put into operation and that we shall
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:12.120]   all be tried by it and examined by it and judged by it. It is a warning, I say, that
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.600]   unless we can claim to have kept it and to obey it, that we shall be punished with everlasting
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.160]   destruction from the presence of the Lord. That is it. It is still there. It has not
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.600]   been withdrawn and no supposed literary criticism or scientific criticism of this scripture
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.920]   can take it out. It is there from beginning to end.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:48.160]   Having law. And then it is a call to repentance. It is a call to us to realize that and having
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:54.880]   realized it to go to God with haste and to confess it and to acknowledge it and to tell
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:01.760]   him that we are conscious of our unworthiness and our folly and our rebellion. It is a call
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:10.600]   to repentance. And then, thank God, it is a call to us to listen to the gospel offer,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.720]   to listen to God's statement that he has so loved the world that he has sent his only
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:21.840]   begotten Son into it, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:29.600]   life. It is still the ancient story, the old, old story of Jesus and his love, of the Son
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.160]   of God who came down and humbled himself and took our sins upon him and took them to the
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:42.080]   cross and bore them in his own body and that there he was punished for them and for us
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.440]   and that because of that God offers us pardon and forgiveness, a new life and all we need.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.400]   That is the word of the Lord. That is the message of the Christian salvation this evening
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:00.520]   and it comes to us as it came of old. Well, now here is the question. What is our response
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:12.320]   to it? And I remind you again, my dear friends, that there are only two possible responses.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.240]   Last Sunday night we considered the Christian response, the believer's response, which
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:24.400]   is this again, "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed. Save me and I shall be saved, for
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.720]   thou art my praise." The Christian says, "Quite right, I accept it, I admit it, it's all true,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.760]   I haven't a word to say, I cast myself upon thy mercy, I believe, though I don't understand."
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:48.240]   That's the believer's response, but oh, alas, there is another response. And here it is
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:18:01.640]   in this fifteenth verse. Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come. I say once more
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:08.120]   in this series of sermons and this noble chapter that I would to God that I hadn't to preach
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:16.080]   in a text like this. But I am not here to choose texts. I am here to expand the scripture,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:24.880]   to hold the truth before you. And as Jeremiah ends with it, I end with it. Here is the position
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:33.240]   you see of the unbeliever, who faces the same message. And as we look at it, you will find,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.080]   I think, that all the characteristics of unbelief are here very plainly and clearly set forth
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:45.720]   before us. Here, perhaps, it is in a particularly extreme and blatant form, but still the principle
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   is the same, and it describes all unbelievers tonight perfectly. Isn't there something almost
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.400]   incredible about this? Isn't it almost beyond belief that there should be anybody in the
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.240]   world who can react like that to the message of Almighty God? But there are such people.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:13.720]   Therefore, let me ask you to consider with me hurriedly my simple analysis of this terrible,
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:21.160]   appalling condition which leads to such unthinkable consequences. What is it that is true of all
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.080]   people who are not Christians? Well, the first thing that is obviously true of them is this,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:34.520]   that they disbelieve the word of God. They don't believe it. That is why we very rightly
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:41.000]   call them unbelievers. You see, the thing I am emphasizing is this, that the thing that
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.760]   takes a man to hell in the last analysis is not drunkenness, nor even murder, it is unbelief.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:54.840]   So that your most respectable person will go there also, unless he believes. It is belief
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:04.520]   or unbelief that determines our destiny, not what we do, I say, and all these other things.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:12.080]   Surely this needs no demonstration. If a man believes this word of God, he'll act on
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.960]   it. He's bound to. You can't believe my synopsis of the gospel just now and just sit
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.400]   where you are and do nothing and say, "All right, I carry on." It's impossible.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.960]   If you believe these things of necessity, you must do something about it. I mean by
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.500]   that that you must go to God and acknowledge it and confess it. You must believe his message
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.200]   and accept it and give yourself to Christ and forsake the world and take up your cross
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.400]   and go after him. You can't help it. You must. If you believe this message, you'll
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:54.520]   flee from the wrath to come. You'll fly to the fountain where alone you can be cleansed.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.760]   And you know, my friend, if you haven't done that, there's only one reason for that,
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:06.480]   and that is that you don't believe the word of the Lord. You don't really believe it.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.560]   You've heard it, you've listened to it, you may say, "Oh, well, I know that."
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.960]   But if you haven't done anything about it, I say, "You really don't believe it."
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:19.200]   Because if you believe it, I say, "It doesn't need any demonstration." You must act upon
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:26.840]   it. If a man tells you when you're walking in the country, "Don't step any further
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.520]   in that direction, the ground suddenly will give way beneath you and you'll fall to
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.920]   destruction." You'd listen to him, wouldn't you? You'd pull back and you'd draw yourself
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.720]   back, of course. I'm telling you something infinitely more alarming than that, and unless
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.960]   you've done something about it in the way I've indicated, there's only one explanation.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.840]   You don't believe it.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:57.680]   Though that unbelief expresses itself in many ways, sometimes it works in this way, that
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:04.760]   a man has a sort of temporary belief. "Ah, yes," he says, "I felt it that night.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.480]   I really was moved by it." And he felt he ought to do something about it. Yes, but the
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.360]   next day that had gone, and he didn't continue what he had resolved the night before. It's
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:21.200]   of no value, you see. That isn't really a belief that's being moved emotionally.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.600]   And we can be moved emotionally. We can be moved in our wills without our minds and our
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.800]   understandings being involved. We can do things in almost an automatic state, but they don't
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:40.120]   last and it doesn't lead to anything. It's finally of no saving value.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.960]   It is belief of the truth. A man seeing it and knowing it and acting because of that,
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   that's the thing that is of value in the sight of God. A temporary belief is no belief.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.520]   Well, sometimes it works like this, that people hear it and they say, "Well, there seems
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.360]   to be something in that," but then they forget all about it. It's like a man, says
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.120]   James, looking at his natural face in a glass, and the moment he walks away he forgets what
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.840]   he looks like. There are many people who look into the perfect law of liberty, but they
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.200]   don't continue therein. Again, it's of no value. They don't really see it. They've
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   never really believed it. But you see, it may take the form as it did
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.440]   in the case of these contemporaries of Jeremiah of an active opposition to it. The sort of
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.280]   person who says, "That gospel of blood, how I hate it, how immoral it is, I can't
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.900]   believe it, and miracles and two natures in one person," of active, militant opposition
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:44.400]   to it, it's all unbelief. Yes, but the thing I want to emphasize tonight is this, that
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:52.040]   a kind of passive resistance is as much unbelief as is that militant, active resistance to
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:58.280]   it. If you haven't really put it into operation, you haven't believed it, whatever the form
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.640]   it may chance to take. The second thing I want to say about this
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.280]   unbeliever, this person who is not a Christian, is that he also defies the word of God. He
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:19.760]   doesn't only disbelieve it, he defies it. And in various ways, he scoffs at it. It's
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:29.320]   very obvious here, isn't it? They say, "Where is the word of the Lord?" You, Jeremiah,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.080]   they say, come before us day after day, and you stand there, and you say in that glib,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.760]   anxious manner of yours, in that glib self-satisfaction, "Thus saith the Lord." You've been saying
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:52.000]   it for years, but where is it? Let it come. They defy it with insolence and daring. They
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.120]   scoff at it. Now, there are many people who still do that.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.480]   The modern way of putting that, of course, is to put it like this, isn't it? They say,
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.280]   "You know, you're a little bit behind the times with your blood and thunder preaching.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.520]   You ought to have been alive a hundred years ago. It would work then. People could be frightened."
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:22.480]   But of course, we are twentieth century men. We can't be frightened. You can't do that
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.720]   with us. It's the same thing, you see. That's the spirit. "Where is the word of the Lord?"
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:35.640]   Don't you know about our knowledge and about our science? I can't be frightened.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:44.480]   But you know, I've sometimes heard very quiet and nice people doing exactly the same thing.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.720]   They haven't spoken violently when they've heard this sort of thing, but they've gone
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:57.680]   away saying, "Oh, that was too harsh. That isn't the love of God. That's not the love
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.440]   of Christ. That's not a part of the gospel." They've defied it. They've come to the conclusion
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.000]   that God has never spoken like this, and that there is no such thing as the wrath of God
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.760]   and the justice and the righteousness of God. They have said, "There isn't such a thing,
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:22.920]   and we're not going to listen to it." Some of them then put it like this. They say, "Well,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:30.160]   I don't believe that gospel, but nothing seems to go wrong. Nothing happens." "Indeed,"
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.680]   they say, "I know many Christian people who've had a very terrible time, and none of these
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.400]   things have happened to me." What of it? What of this word of the Lord? "I'll compare my
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.720]   life with theirs. Look at them and their troubles and their trials. Look at my life. All is
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:50.840]   well with me." Where is the word of the Lord? That's what they're saying.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.520]   Then others put it in this form. They say, "You know, it doesn't really seem to make
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:02.920]   much difference whether you believe or whether you don't. The life of Christians and non-Christians,
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.460]   in respect of these matters as to what happens to them, it seems to be almost identical.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.960]   It doesn't make any difference." Well, now then, why? Where is this? That's the position.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.760]   The unbeliever, I say, is one who disbelieves the word of the Lord, and he defies it, and
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:23.800]   he scoffs at it. Why do they do so? Let me answer that question very hurriedly.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:29.960]   The unbeliever disbelieves and scoffs at the word because he's ignorant. What's he ignorant
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:36.440]   of? Well, he's ignorant of history. He's ignorant of the fact that, as Peter reminds those people
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.480]   to whom he writes that second epistle, he's ignorant of the fact that there have been
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.160]   people like him many times before in the world, and they've said exactly the same thing.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:54.000]   They've said, "Where is the promise of his coming?" But they live to see that it did come.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.360]   And a man who still says that sort of thing is just ignorant of history. He's ignorant
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.160]   of the story of the Bible, the historical facts chronicled here. He's ignorant even
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.560]   of his secular history, of the movement of God amongst the nations and in the world amongst
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:17.680]   its peoples. He's ignorant of all that. He wouldn't speak as he does if he knew his history.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:26.920]   But he's also ignorant of God's ways and God's methods and God's times. He's got an idea,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.120]   you see, that when God says he's going to do a thing, he'll do it at once. And when
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.520]   he discovers that God doesn't do it at once, he says, "Ha! I knew it wouldn't come to pass.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.800]   I knew it would never happen. I never did believe it. I wasn't frightened for a second.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:47.440]   God says, I'm told, but God does nothing." He's ignorant of the fact that with God a
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   thousand years there is one day and one day is a thousand years. That God's ways are not
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.680]   our ways nor God's thoughts our thoughts. That God has his own way of doing things,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:04.320]   his own plan and purpose. God announces he may allow centuries to pass before he performs,
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.760]   but then he does it and never fails. They're ignorant of that because he doesn't happen
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.600]   to conform to their little timetables and to their own ideas. They think that it's never
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:22.640]   going to happen at all. Another thing they're ignorant of is this, of God's might and God's
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:31.360]   power. You know, my friends, the way in which men speak of God tells us a great deal about
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:44.600]   him. When men say, "Why does God?" they speak like that because they don't know his power.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.960]   You read the book of Job and you'll find that poor Job said many things in his suffering
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.040]   and in his agony. Ah, yes, he discovered that he was ignorant, he didn't know. And the moment
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.800]   he saw God, you remember what he did? He put his hand upon his mouth. He said, "I've spoken
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   inadvisably with my lips. I had heard of thee with the hearing of thee, but now, what a
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.480]   fool I was," says Job, "ever to have complained, ever to have thought that you were against
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.560]   me, or there ever to have grumbled at your dealings with me. It's my little mind I didn't
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:23.200]   know." And it's nothing but sheer, stark ignorance that makes men speak like this and scoff at
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:32.640]   God and at his word. They don't know his might and his power. But oh, the most tragic
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:43.880]   aspect of their ignorance is this. They don't know God's love and God's long suffering.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:51.760]   The Lord is not slack, as some men count slackness, as Peter puts it, but is long suffering to
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:58.400]   usward. That's the explanation. Not willing that any should perish, but that all should
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:05.080]   come to repentance. You see, these scoffers, how ignorant they are of his methods, of his
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.040]   might and his greatness. Yes, but I say above everything else about this wonderful love
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:16.880]   of his. He's not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is long suffering
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:24.520]   to usward. Not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. And
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:30.920]   isn't that the appalling thing about the unbeliever? That he's ignorant of the fact that the very
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.400]   fact that he's still alive and that God hasn't blotted him out of existence is entirely due
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.000]   to the love of God. He wouldn't be there to scoff if God were not a God of love and gives
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.320]   him this further opportunity, as it were. The love of God and the compassion of God
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:58.040]   and the long suffering of God. It is that characteristic of God, his holy love, that
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.600]   central attribute in the character of God that accounts for the fact that God delays
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.120]   and doesn't call the axe to fall the next minute. That's why you and I have been permitted
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:15.320]   to sin for years in unbelief and didn't go out once to hell. It's God's love, it's
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:22.120]   God's mercy, it's God's long suffering and compassion. But the scoffer knows nothing
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:29.200]   about that. He's ignorant of the most glorious thing about God. Very well, there's our
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   second point. The unbeliever, the non-Christian disbelieves the word of God. The second thing
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   is that he defies it and he scoffs at it. Yes, but the third and the last thing is this.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:53.960]   The unbeliever, the disbeliever, the defier, the scoffer shall prove the truth of the word
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   of the Lord in his own life and in his own experience. Where is the word of the Lord?
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   Jeremiah, with your preaching and your warnings, where is it? You've said it for years, nothing
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.640]   happens. If we had listened to you a thousand times, we'd have said the end has come and
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   we'd have escaped for our lives. Nothing's happened. Where is the word of the Lord? Let
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:47.360]   him come. Let God do his worst. My last principle, I say, is this. That the request, the mocking,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   scoffing request of the unbeliever will be granted. He shall have that for which he asks.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:15.920]   Defying God, he says, "Let it come."
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   The answer of God to all who may think and speak like that tonight is still this. The
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness. The day of the
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.440]   Lord shall come. It will come. Peter, with his prophetic insight and understanding, says,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:52.040]   in the last days scoffers shall arise and say, "Where is the promise of his coming?"
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.680]   Because they say everything stands in the world exactly as it did from the beginning,
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:01.560]   where is all this threatening? Where is this idea of a judgment and the end of history
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.880]   and the end of the world and God separating mankind into the two final groups? Where is
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.760]   it? Let it come.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   The day of the Lord will come and will come as a thief in the night. The day of the Lord
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   will come as a thief in the night.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   Oh, my dear friends, what God says always comes. I said at the beginning that these
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:36.840]   unbelievers are ignorant of history. Let me prove my contention. As Peter reminds us in
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.920]   that third chapter of his second epistle, that was precisely what people said before
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.640]   the flood. Look at that man Noah. For a hundred and twenty years he was building an ark and
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.080]   preaching to his contemporaries and saying, "There is a terrible judgment coming. There
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.920]   is a flood coming. I am building an ark to save myself and my house. Repent, believe
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:02.240]   in God, give up your sins, lest you be drowned in the calamity." For a hundred and twenty
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   years. And they laughed at him with scorn and derision.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   But it came. It came. Sodom and Gomorrah in the same way would not listen to the exhortations
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:27.840]   of the man who is described as righteous lot, though he was a very poor man himself. But
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.520]   he saw the sin and he pleaded with them. They did not listen. And they laughed at him. And
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   they went on with all their vices and their sins and their immoralities.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   But the brimstone and the fire did fall, and the cities of the plain were destroyed. The
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:57.160]   mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:06.080]   Take these children of Israel before the captivity of Babylon. God raised up prophet after prophet,
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.720]   sent to them this mighty succession, and they pleaded with them and exhorted them and did
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.920]   their utmost to bring them to repentance and to return to God. And they laughed at them.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:20.600]   They killed so many of them. They said, "These men are spoilsports. These men are alarmists.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:27.120]   It's nonsense. Nothing is going to happen." But it did happen.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.920]   The city of Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jews found themselves in the misery of the
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   captivity of Babylon. You know, it was exactly the same at the time when our Lord himself
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:44.360]   was here on earth. Do you remember that extraordinary account that is given in the twenty-seventh
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.720]   chapter of Matthew's Gospel of the argument between Pilate and the authorities? Pilate
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:56.240]   was doing his utmost to set the Lord Jesus Christ at liberty. His wife had had a dream,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.880]   you remember, and in the dream she had seen something of the truth. And she said to her
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.800]   husband, "Have nothing to do with these innocent men. Don't put these men to death at all
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.760]   cost, whatever you do." And Pilate went out to the men and said, "You know," he said,
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.280]   "I'm not going to do this." He took a bowl of water and he washed his hands before them.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   He said, "I wash my hands. I am innocent of the blood of this just person. See ye to
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   it." Then answered all the people and said, this is what they said, "His blood be on us
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:36.040]   and on our children." Pilate, they said, "You're losing your nerve, men. You're rather forgetting
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.720]   that you're a great potentate. Are you frightened by a dream that your wife had last night?
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:47.520]   We are not afraid. You say you wash your hands of his blood. Very well. Let it come on us.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   His blood be on us and on our children. For it is the word of the Lord. Let it come."
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:04.480]   And in A.D. 70 it came in the most violent and hellish manner that the world has ever
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   known, the most awful calamity that's ever fell upon a nation. The Jews were overwhelmed.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   They were thrust out and they've remained out ever since. The awful slaughter of A.D.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:23.760]   70, the blood of Christ came upon them. They said, "Let it come." It came and on their
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   children and on their children's children and it's continuing until tonight. Read the
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:38.880]   story of the centuries of the massacre of the Jews and of all that they've had to endure
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:46.320]   down to the days of Hitler. See the mark upon them. Why? They asked for it. They said, "Let
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   it come." And it has come. And as certainly as we are in this building at this moment,
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:11.600]   to any man or woman who says the same thing defiantly, scoffingly, in terms of the knowledge
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   of the twentieth century, "Let it come. Where is it? What do I care?"
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:27.920]   Your request, my friend, shall be granted. And you will know it. The word of the Lord
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:39.440]   will be fulfilled. The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night and the elements
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   shall melt with fervent heat. And there shall be a final conflagration and a destruction
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.720]   of evil and sin. And all who have given themselves to it, they will be defroyed everlastingly
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   out of the presence and the sight of the Lord.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   What is your response to the word of the Lord? Do you believe it? Do you believe that God's
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:23.240]   law is still in operation? Do you really believe that you will have to answer point by point
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:35.440]   to the Ten Commandments? Do you believe that you, you yourself, are going to be asked this?
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:44.760]   Have you loved the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   mind and all your strength and your neighbour as yourself? Do you really believe that you
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:58.120]   are not only going to be asked it, but that those are the terms in which you are going
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   to be judged to all eternity? Do you believe it? Do you really believe that there is a
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:12.400]   life beyond death? And that when you die it isn't the end, but that your spirit goes
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:18.480]   on? And that there is to be a final resurrection and a last judgment? And that you and I and
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   all will stand before God and that these are the terms I ask you? Do you really believe
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:35.280]   that? That that is going to happen to you? That is what God says, that is the message
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.480]   of the word of the Lord, that that is going to happen to every one of us, as certainly
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:46.720]   as we are here now, more certainly. Do you believe that unless you are right with God
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   that you are going to hell? And that hell means eternal destruction from the presence
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:43:01.080]   of the Lord, untold and unthinkable remorse and misery and suffering and unhappiness.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:09.040]   Do you really believe it? If you really do, well then you will feel just as much as I
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   do. If you really do, well then you will feel desperate. You will feel hopeless. You will
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:28.080]   feel that you haven't got a word to say for yourself, nor a plea to offer. You will forget
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.320]   all your good deeds and all your kindness and all your business and activity and all
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:38.760]   your experiences and all else. And you will say, "I cannot stand before such a God. What
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   can I do?" And then you will believe the further part of the message, that you must
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:57.080]   go to God at once and acknowledge and confess your sin, repent in other words, and seek
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:03.520]   salvation and ask him what can be done, and then believe him when he tells you. Yes, that
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.360]   though this is so true of you, and though you deserve nothing but such punishment, that
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.160]   nevertheless he has loved you and has so loved you that he made his Son finally receive you
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:20.160]   unto himself and share his eternal glory with you. Do you believe it? That is the word of
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:29.600]   the Lord. Do you agree with Jeremiah and say, "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed. No
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.640]   one else can heal me. I can't. No one can. You can. And if you do it, it's perfect.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed. Save me, and I shall be saved for thou art my praise."
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:49.160]   Are you saying that? Have you said it? If you have never said it before, say it tonight
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:56.840]   in this service. Say it now. Say it as I give you an opportunity quietly at the close. If
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:00.960]   you believe it, I say you must. I don't want to bring pressure to bear upon you. I
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.400]   don't want you to respond to anything I say. I give you the word of the Lord. If you
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   believe it, you can't remain as you are. You must do something about it. You must see
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:22.200]   that to belong to the world and its way leads to hell, and you don't want to go there.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.600]   And you must see that the only way is to forsake it and the sin that belongs to it and go after
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   Christ and trust to Him. You must. If you believe this message concerning Jesus Christ
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:42.920]   and Him crucified, you can go in the full assurance of faith. Because you say to yourself,
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   "Though I am a sinner, though I am guilty of sins, Christ has borne them, has borne
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.600]   their punishment and their guilt. He's taken them away, and God will remember them no more.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:04.440]   I believe this, so by the blood of Christ I'll go in as I am, trusting to His perfect
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:10.000]   work and His merit, knowing that God will honor His word and will receive me." That's
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   the full assurance of faith. It isn't ignoring your sins, it's facing them, it's confessing
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.400]   them, it's admitting them, but saying, "Yes, but Christ has died for me. His blood can
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:34.040]   make the foulest clean. His blood availed for me."
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:41.680]   There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins, and sinners plunged
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:50.480]   beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains. It's the only thing that's strong enough
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:47:01.440]   and potent enough to take out the stain of sin, but it is enough, and it doesn't matter
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.760]   what you've been. I can't give you a list that is worse than that which Paul gives in
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.560]   1 Corinthians 6. It includes everybody in this congregation, doesn't it? Have you been
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.960]   a murderer? It doesn't matter. That can be blotted out, that stain can be taken out by
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   the blood of Christ, if you but believe He died for you.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:30.040]   So don't talk about your sins. Don't talk about your fitness any longer or any more.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   All the fitness you require is to feel your need of Him. His blood cleanseth from all
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:47.840]   sin and unrighteousness. You believe that, and then go in the full assurance and confidence
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:57.400]   of faith, pleading only the blood of Christ shed for you and for your sins, and God will
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:04.680]   receive you and will let you know that your sins and iniquities He will remember no more.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:12.400]   I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean. When God washes you in
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:22.720]   the blood of Christ, there is no more remembrance of sin. It's gone. Your sins are forgiven
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   in Him, and you go to God to thank Him and to give yourself to Him and to pledge yourself
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:42.200]   to live only to His praise, His glory, His honor, who has so loved you that at such a
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:49.400]   price and at such a cost, He has ransomed and rescued and redeemed and cleansed you
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:56.280]   and brought you back unto Himself and is now beginning to shower His blessings upon you.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   The first question is the guilt of your past sins, and until they are removed, you are
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   out of relationship with God. But in Christ and Him crucified, you can be reconciled,
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   restored, ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven. Who like me His praise should sting? Amen.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:42.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
