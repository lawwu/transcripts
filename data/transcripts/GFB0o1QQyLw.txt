[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   Amy asks, "What's your strategy to navigate openness
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.500]   to comments and criticism while also handling negative
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.960]   and destructive feedback appropriately?"
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.480]   There's so much to say about this,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.940]   and my opinion and thinking about it,
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.680]   I think will change throughout my life
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.280]   as it does for a lot of people
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.720]   as we learn how to navigate the internet
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.100]   and how to have, as cheesy as it is to say,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.120]   but healthy conversation, civil discourse on the internet.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.800]   Because there's several models of this.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.560]   There's the Joe Rogan model.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.080]   Again, I look up to Joe in many ways,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.840]   in the openness and genuineness
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.320]   and the purity of the way he does communication,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.920]   conversation with people, the way just he is,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.160]   no matter how much money he makes.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.840]   But his idea is that you shouldn't read any of the comments.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560]   And for the most part, he actually sticks to that here,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.200]   really does not read many comments,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.800]   except to get a certain large aggregate sense
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.680]   of where the community is.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.680]   For me, I tend to still, first of all, I'm not famous.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.720]   So it's not like I have a huge amount of inflow of comments,
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.880]   but there's still so much to learn from the conversations.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.600]   And I've been fortunate and blessed for the most part
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   to be surrounded by people who are kind and thoughtful
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.760]   and just everything, compassionate, empathetic,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.040]   brilliant in ways I'm not, even in disagreement,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.280]   especially disagreement.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.660]   I love disagreement.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.200]   That's one of the tragic things to me about the internet,
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.880]   about certain types of discourse,
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   especially political discourse,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   is how little artful disagreement there is.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.720]   I believe disagreement is an art.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.240]   It requires care, it requires skill,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.920]   it requires compassion and respect.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.520]   One of the key underlying things to me
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.900]   behind passionate disagreement is respect,
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.880]   even a love for the other person.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.720]   And to me, there's a line between disagreement with intent
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.120]   that doesn't deeply respect the other person
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   with an intent that almost, it's somewhere between apathy
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.280]   and derision and not even hatred
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.000]   'cause it's a jealousy, it's a dismissal,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.760]   it's a motivation that does not respect the other person
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.220]   in some way and almost dismisses the value
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.060]   of their significance in this universe.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.920]   And that kind of disagreement is something
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.340]   I dislike very much and I'm not open to
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.660]   and I would like to, on the internet, move away from.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.320]   But at the same time, disagreement and criticism
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.080]   and comments that are tense, that create turmoil,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.840]   but have underlying deep respect and love,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.000]   those are beautiful.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.680]   Not, those aren't as often seen on the internet,
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.280]   unfortunately, they're more often seen in person.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400]   And I think that's what I love.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.200]   That's sort of the most heated,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.400]   again, I say this over and over,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.280]   but I think it comes from the Russian culture.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.980]   There's this heated debates, heated conversations
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.200]   where sometimes you take in a viewpoint in person
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.360]   that you don't even believe.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.600]   Like I play devil's advocate all the time,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.960]   especially in political discussions.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.120]   Somebody says they're Bernie Sanders fan,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.600]   I will immediately become an anti-democratic socialist.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   Or if you're an Andrew Yang fan,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.800]   I will immediately become an anti-UBI person
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.680]   in that conversation just to see, just to bounce ideas,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.560]   to sort of take a certain on viewpoint,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.600]   to try it on for size and see.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.560]   And when there's underlying respect,
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.880]   you get to play, there's humor, there's wit.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.840]   Ultimately, you arrive at something profound as a result.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.400]   Now, that's a dream for me and I've been trying
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.920]   to cultivate a community of that kind of discourse,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.360]   of underlying respect and love,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.240]   whether you agree or disagree.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.600]   And that's my openness is grounded in the optimism
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.920]   that that's possible.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   And the few criticisms or negativity that doesn't have that,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.160]   that's really grounded in mockery
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.940]   and a complete lack of respect,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.160]   that's just part of it.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.320]   Sometimes you walk on a sidewalk
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.120]   and you step in dog poop.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480]   (laughs)
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.840]   There's gotta be a better example than that.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.880]   But anyway, that's just life.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.920]   This is like Forrest Gump says,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.980]   "Shit happens," or he had the smile, whatever.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.320]   There's other forms like, I don't know what's the,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.520]   what's the right term for it,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.800]   but busting each other's chops.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   I mean, that could be just a guy thing.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.520]   It could be an everybody thing, but I love it.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.040]   You sort of make fun of each other.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.880]   You tease each other.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.480]   Some of my closest friends make fun of me all the time.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.080]   Some of the closest people, I know that that's,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.960]   that's how we show love.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.520]   I don't know, is you make fun of each other.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.720]   But a lot of people get confused.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.080]   You have to earn that.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.500]   You have to, again, it's that love and respect.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.560]   If you're just busting chops without having respect
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.460]   or a friendship or love, then it turns into mockery.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.440]   And one of the fundamental problems of the internet
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.080]   is the mechanisms of social media reward you for mockery,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.920]   whether you have the respect or not.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.540]   It's interesting because there's a humor to it
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.000]   that everybody can, as an observer, can appreciate,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.600]   but the people in the arena don't appreciate it
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.240]   when there's not an underlying respect.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.760]   And so I very much see that line.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.640]   If respect is missing, then you busting my chops
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.960]   or you disagreeing is something that I have no patience for.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.240]   If there is an underlying respect and love
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.520]   and appreciation for each other as human beings,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.540]   then disagreement and busting chops is a beautiful thing.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.780]   So in general, when I take criticism,
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.980]   whether it's the harsh kind, the disrespectful kind,
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.120]   or the one that is grounded in respect,
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   I kind of take it as a,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.500]   as any kind of pain in this world.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.740]   So I can give a stupid analogy, I guess,
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.860]   of just touching a hot stove.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.180]   I've recently did that.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.780]   That's why it pops to mind.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.780]   And you kind of, what I do is I observe it,
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.200]   observe the criticism,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.180]   observe the moment of me touching the hot stove,
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.500]   and I take a step outside of myself
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.900]   as like a third-person observer,
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.260]   just sort of breathe and take it in,
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.300]   and really just kind of take in the full richness
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.380]   of that experience.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.980]   Then once sort of the pain of it settles,
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.140]   the sort of the shock of it,
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.220]   and it can be shocking when somebody criticizes you,
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.980]   is you see what is the lesson I can learn from this?
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.380]   That's fundamentally the, what, you know,
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.000]   strip away the meanness, the mockery,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.380]   whatever that might be there,
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.340]   or if it's respect or disagreement,
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.240]   the biting fact that somebody disagrees,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.600]   and just see what's the insight here that I can take away,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.760]   what's the lesson I can learn that I can grow from?
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.640]   So in touching the hot stove,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.440]   the reason I got burnt is I was checking if it's hot,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.560]   if it's working, 'cause it didn't look like it was working.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.440]   And so I guess the lesson I can learn from that
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.740]   is that you don't have to actually touch the stove
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.200]   to figure out that it's working.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.320]   You can just hover your hand above it,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.480]   and you can sense the heat, right?
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.520]   Okay, perhaps a stupid analogy,
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.720]   but it's a lesson I can learn moving forward.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.040]   I can do better next time, I can grow from.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.680]   Criticism, the same thing.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.920]   I mean, there's a lot of people that criticize
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.400]   little things about the way I communicate.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.520]   I really put myself out there, I make myself fragile.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.920]   I make myself vulnerable to criticism.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.680]   And you know, you say things like,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.640]   I'm too philosophical, or I get too in the weeds
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.560]   about something without covering
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.880]   some other fundamental part, if we're having a conversation.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.600]   Or I have a monotone voice, not enough emotion,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.160]   not enough personality.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.520]   All those kinds of things that have
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.240]   an inkling of truth to them.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.520]   Some things that can't really help,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   some things I can work on.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.960]   It might be a long-term thing.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.560]   People say I mumble, I need to articulate better.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   That's something I'm cognizant of, and I try to work on.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.360]   Some people say I don't make enough eye contact.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.320]   All those kinds of things.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.640]   I mean, there's truth in them,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.760]   even if they come with meanness.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.600]   Some people say I ask too many stupid questions.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.480]   And you take criticism, you think about that.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.280]   Is there some deep insight there that's useful?
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.760]   And like the stupid question one,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.560]   I can now, the process is I empathize,
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.400]   where did that person's criticism come from?
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.920]   What is their worldview from which
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.520]   they come to that criticism?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.440]   Because for me, in conversation, for example,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.560]   when somebody says that I came off,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.120]   I asked a stupid question, I came off as stupid,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.480]   or I got outclassed in conversation,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.960]   to me that means that was a success.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.120]   Because my role in these conversations,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.600]   my goal is to be, is to have no ego,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.680]   to let the other person shine.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.720]   And asking the simplest possible question,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.240]   almost naive kinds of questions,
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.280]   get to the fundamental core of ideas
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.040]   that I think could potentially be beautiful.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.680]   If the other person comes there
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.120]   and is willing to accept the dance
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.120]   of the sort of, the silly Russian asking the silly question,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.720]   accept the chance to answer that silly question
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.200]   with something beautiful and profound.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.960]   I think that's the goal.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.640]   And yeah, from your perspective,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.160]   that might come off, if not done well,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.540]   or if the other person doesn't accept the dance,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.280]   it can come off as I'm asking really dumb questions
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   that have no useful, no use in conversation.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.440]   If it's really successful and done beautifully,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.520]   and some of that is luck,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.440]   and then it works out and nobody notices it,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.540]   and then it's, nobody notices how dumb the question was.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.680]   And in terms of being outclassed,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.920]   I got so many comments that, like Jim Keller,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.480]   for example, somebody I deeply admire
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.040]   and a brilliant guy, totally outclassed me in conversation.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   To me, that's a success.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.120]   This isn't a competition to me.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   To me, it's a way to let Jim's ideas shine.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.400]   I did wanna push back enough, but that's the beauty of it.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.480]   I wanna push back and disagree
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.240]   so that it leads to something productive,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.880]   and ultimately, they can shine with something profound.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.160]   I don't want to articulate my disagreement
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.480]   to a point where it becomes awkward and too tense and so on.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.040]   Just like in dancing, I love, for example,
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.840]   I get so much shit for saying "Sentimental Woman"
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.280]   is a good movie, but I do like the tango.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.040]   I do like certain types of dances.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.440]   Tango's probably my favorite.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   And there's a lead and there's a follow,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.480]   and that's true in dance.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.380]   That's, I think, true in conversation.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.160]   Those can switch, of course, in conversation,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.600]   but there's an art to it.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.060]   And the people that criticize certain aspects of that
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.280]   have a lot of kernels of truth that I pick on
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.120]   and I pick from and learn from.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.200]   And so it's a gift.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.520]   I see it as a beautiful gift,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.040]   but it burns, especially if it lacks the respect,
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.440]   if it has those elements of mockery and derision,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.680]   like I mentioned.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.380]   One of the things I do next after I think about the lesson
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.380]   is I kind of imagine them in my head,
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.160]   and I send love to them.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.560]   I forgive them.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.160]   It sounds silly, not that they ask for my forgiveness,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.780]   but in my mind, I kind of,
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.080]   I forgive the roughness of their message.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   And I also like to imagine meeting them in person
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.520]   and shaking their hand
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.100]   and sort of having a laugh about something silly.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.120]   'Cause I think I kind of imagine,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.760]   or I have an optimistic view of it
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.080]   that a lot of it is just miscommunication
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.920]   or perhaps my misinterpretation
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.880]   of where they were coming from,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.960]   but in person, a lot of those things fade away
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.140]   and you just focus,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.040]   you don't sweat the small stuff,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.280]   and it's all small stuff, right?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.880]   You just kind of laugh at the,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.520]   you become quick friends, I think.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.680]   That's the optimism I have
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.640]   about most interactions on the internet
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.300]   is that if you actually met in person,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.600]   you get along just great.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.400]   And on social media, if there is disrespect,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.200]   I do, at least at this time,
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   if I see that there's not an underlying respect
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.880]   and love and appreciation for each other,
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.280]   I reach my hand out, I try to patch it up,
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.600]   but if that doesn't work,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.520]   I usually sort of,
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.120]   whatever the mechanism social media provides
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.400]   of blocking, of muting, of limiting,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.560]   somehow I do it.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.560]   And it's, again, not because of some kind of anger
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.600]   and any kind of negative ill feeling,
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.080]   it's just about that I don't see the,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.200]   that medium doesn't seem to be one
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   where we would be able to find a mutual respect,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.640]   or one of us wouldn't be able to find a respect.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.800]   So I'll reach out my hand,
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.200]   but if it gets slapped down,
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.880]   I'll block, mute, whatever the mechanism allows,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.240]   and then just wait until we meet in person.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.220]   And maybe then, instead of a handshake,
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.160]   I'll go straight in for the hug.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   So I think even with the roughest interactions,
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.560]   if we met in person, it would go along great.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.400]   And I just then don't see social media
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.480]   as a great place for it.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.000]   But again, I first take in whatever the commentary
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.540]   they make and try to find the insight in it.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:06.000]   And after that, it can burn, it can burn,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.920]   and I just forget it, put it behind me,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.520]   and go on with a smile.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.160]   Again, forgive them, send love their way,
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.880]   and then move on after the lesson has been learned.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.500]   That's my approach to,
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.280]   that's my general approach to criticism.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.600]   And overall, I've been so fortunate
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   to have so much positive feedback
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.800]   and interesting, profound conversations.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.680]   I was challenged in a lot of interesting ways.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.120]   I've been shown to be wrong in a lot of interesting ways
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.920]   from people that sandwich that all in a lot of respect
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.400]   and admiration and mutual admiration.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.440]   So I've been really fortunate.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.260]   So for the most part, it's been a lot of positive energy,
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.060]   and I appreciate that.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.060]   And I think,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.040]   I mean, sometimes I feel like
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.260]   I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.320]   So all I can do is read comments
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.000]   and read the little bit of criticism there is,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.120]   learn from it, grow from it,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   and continue being part of this community.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.600]   So this is kind of a new AMA thing.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.360]   I tried to do a longer response.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.080]   I'm trying to see if the five minutes is better,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.520]   one minute is better, 20 minutes is better,
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.880]   or if it's better, then I just shut up and don't do these.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.720]   So I don't know.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.360]   But again, Amy, thank you so much.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.160]   That was a great question.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.680]   I think like all of us,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.080]   I will continue to evolve in the way I take in the feedback.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.280]   It's possible eventually I'll converge
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.840]   towards the Joe Rogan model,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.720]   but for now, my heart, my mind, my eyes
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.320]   are open to criticism on the internet,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.400]   not just in person.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.900]   Thanks for the great question.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:16.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
