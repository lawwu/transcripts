[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.120]   with Sunil Gupta, the co-founder of the Gross National Happiness Center, where we'll share
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.440]   the ancient wisdom of dharma and ways to incorporate simple yet effective daily habits into your
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.180]   life so that you can find success and joy in everything you do without sacrificing your
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.840]   professional ambition.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.420]   And if you like what you hear from me and all the hacks, please give us a thumbs up

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.220]   All right, let's get into it.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.860]   Sunil, thank you for joining me again.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220]   Chris, it's really good to be back.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.600]   This whole book you wrote is based on dharma, this concept that's thousand years old or
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.900]   more found in various Indian religions and philosophies.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.380]   So I'm curious what it is about this millennia old concept of dharma that you thought was
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.820]   so important that people today need to understand it and even practice it.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.020]   Dharma is a timeless solution to, I think, the emptiness that so many of us are feeling
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.740]   right now, especially at work.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.020]   You know, most of us believe that the number one determiner for our mental health is our
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.820]   job and yet very few people right now can actually say that they are enjoying their
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.660]   job on a day-to-day basis, it seems.
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.700]   And dharma is really this way of how do we bring the joy back into what we do each day.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.740]   And what kind of impact do you think that could have on someone's life?
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.700]   Is it just being happy or can it go beyond that?
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.140]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's more than happiness, at least it is for me.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.040]   You know, I think it's about finding some meaning in what it is that we do.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.340]   And I know meaning is a big word, but I think the way that I sort of look at it and I think
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.580]   that when I go back and I look at the way that my ancestors would think about dharma,
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.900]   it's that there are sort of two kind of ways that we can look at success in life.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.540]   There's outer success, which is wealth and its status and its fancy LinkedIn profiles.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.980]   And then there's inner success, which is truly are you enjoying what you do each day?
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.700]   And the point of dharma isn't necessarily to shame outside success or to shame the idea
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.340]   of wanting nice things or having a career that is ambitious that other people respect.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.700]   What it is saying though is that we can get all that stuff and still not feel inner success,
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.260]   which is really meaning and a sense of purpose in what we do.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.420]   And I know that I've experienced that and Chris, you and I have had enough conversations
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.580]   to feel like you, I think at least a certain degree, have experienced that as well.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.340]   Whereas like you were getting the outside rewards, you were in jobs that other people
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.580]   found to be interesting, but at the same time, it wasn't really lighting you up.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.660]   And at a certain point in time, it can be very easy to be walking a path that doesn't
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.580]   actually feel like your own.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.580]   So the idea behind dharma isn't to shun, again, the idea of wanting nice things or doing things
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.020]   that are really interesting, but it's more about beginning with inner success.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.420]   What is it that actually lights you up?
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.060]   And investing in that, even when we are overwhelmed with other things in our life.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.460]   And I think that's where I wanted to write a book that really challenged philosophy through
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.900]   the lens of today's day and age, fast paced, overwhelmed, lots of comparison.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.420]   How do we bring this concept of dharma into what's happening today?
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.420]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.340]   You talked about me and I look back at my history and every job I had, maybe until very
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580]   recently, I wasn't excited about.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.300]   I thought I couldn't do this job forever.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.340]   And in fact, the reason why I've been so passionate about personal finance in my life was because
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.700]   I thought I have to save as much money as possible because I haven't found a job that
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.180]   lights me up sustainably.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.780]   Any job I started, it would light me up for a period of time.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.980]   Maybe it was six months, 12 months, at some point, I was like, "Hmm, I'm no longer lit
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980]   up by this.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860]   Am I ever going to find something that lights me up?
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.060]   I don't know."
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.620]   And I stumbled into it through a series of trial and error, but it would be great had
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.140]   there been a book that I could have read to be like, "Hmm, this isn't lighting me up.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.300]   What would?"
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.340]   And I love that you broke it into practices.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.260]   So maybe I've pulled a few of the ones that I thought were exciting to talk about and
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.860]   maybe we could talk about a few of them.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.820]   Obviously, I really enjoyed the entire book.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.900]   So if anyone wants the rest of them, there is an entire place to get all of those.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.220]   But I think at the beginning, the first one is about uncovering your essence.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.580]   And I'm sure I'm going to butcher some of these names, but I'm going to call it Zooka.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.260]   And maybe that's a good place to start because I think a lot of us are thinking, "I know
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   what I'm good at.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.300]   I know what I'd like to do, but I don't really know what I should do."
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.780]   So Zooka is really about your essence, uncovering your essence.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.220]   And this is the way that my grandfather described dharma to me, which is like dharma has been
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.700]   called many different things.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.460]   You'll find different definitions.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.660]   I think one that comes closest is inner calling, but my grandfather called that your essence.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.980]   We all have an essence.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.140]   And the question is, are we expressing that?
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.780]   The key, I think though, Chris, and this is where I got it wrong for a lot of years, which
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.700]   is I always assumed that essence equals job.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.860]   Essence equals job title, right?
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.140]   So my essence is to be a programmer.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.140]   My essence is to be a product manager or to be a lawyer.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.300]   Those are occupations, but they're not an essence.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.660]   An essence is more, it's deeper than that.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.220]   It's I enjoy helping people.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.340]   I enjoy designing things from scratch.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.580]   I enjoy assembling products or growing other people's careers.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.580]   And the idea is that when you can come back to that essence, it opens up a universe of
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.460]   possibilities because there are always multiple ways to express that essence.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.740]   And one of the stories in the book is about a nurse named Karen that really felt like
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.780]   her dharma was to be a writer.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.780]   That's what she wanted to do.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.260]   She wanted to write, but she couldn't afford to do that.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.540]   She couldn't afford to quit her job and she had spent a lot of time investing in the profession
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.540]   of nursing.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.200]   And she was actually doing pretty well as a nurse, so she was torn, like I think a lot
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   of us are.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   She was showing up to the hospital.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.140]   She was doing the work, but she wasn't emotionally connected to what she was doing every day.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.100]   Eventually, the way that she ended up finding her dharma was not by quitting her job and
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.300]   becoming a writer.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.220]   The way she found it initially was by patient paperwork.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.100]   Like literally while other nurses and doctors would fill out the clinical details of a patient
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.220]   form and hit print, she started to actually write about the patient.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.420]   Who were they?
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.500]   What did they love?
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   How did they spend their evenings and what really mattered to them?
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.940]   And she would pour these details into these patient, really clinical patient forms to
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.980]   the point that every single one of these forms almost turned into like a mini novel.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.740]   And she would start to pass these forms around the hospital and they would get distributed
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.300]   by others because it really reminded them of the humanity of what it is that they do.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.740]   Now again, her profession was nurse and that stayed the same.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.740]   She didn't quit her job.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.980]   She didn't make any type of lateral shift, but the essence of being a writer was something
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.620]   that she was now bringing into her day to day, right?
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.740]   And that's kind of the point of this first chapter of Sukha is if we can dig below the
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.380]   occupation mindset that so many of us have been put into and go deeper into the essence
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.020]   of what it is that you love, like ultimately what is that thing that you feel like really
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.580]   embodies who you are, then you can start to find other ways to express what you do.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.380]   And in the book, I offer some ways that we can sort of start to get to that.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.460]   And the metaphor that I love is Michelangelo would look at a block of marble and he would
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.460]   say the sculpture is already inside.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.740]   I just need to chisel away the layers that are in its way.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.940]   And I think Dharma operates in very much the same way.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.220]   I can almost guarantee for you and me and anybody who's listening right now, there is
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.340]   an essence that you've already been in touch with at some point in time, right?
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.300]   It could have been when you were a little kid, it could have been last week, but you
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.060]   kind of had been, you've had brushes, incidents with this essence.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.180]   We just, it may be buried under deadlines, under drop-offs, under all the other things
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.820]   that we have going on in our lives.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.620]   And we can start to kind of chisel away those layers.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.500]   One of the ways that we can do that is through good questions.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.100]   I think good questions are an amazing sort of way to kind of come back to who we are.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.060]   One of the questions that I love the most is what would you do for free?
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.180]   If compensation was not a factor, what is it that you would want to spend your time
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.460]   doing anyway?
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.860]   And that's not to say that like all of a sudden you can flip a switch and go work for
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.820]   free or that you should work for free.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.500]   But if you can clearly answer that question, right?
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.060]   What's that thing that I would keep doing even if I wasn't getting paid?
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.100]   Now you're starting to get closer to this thing inside of you that wants to express
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.100]   itself no matter how the outside world reacts.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.380]   There are a series of those types of questions in the book that help us get closer to that
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.380]   essence.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.380]   And these are the chisels.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.380]   Is that right?
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.540]   These are the chisels, yeah.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.260]   The other thing that I think is really interesting is what I call the bright spots chisel.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.340]   The bright spots chisel.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.100]   And what I mean by that is in my career, I spend a lot of time writing, meeting with
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.140]   people who have succeeded at their highest levels.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.020]   But I spend the other half of my time I think meeting with people who are miserable in their
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:34.820]   careers and helping them come to a place where they can actually do I think their best work,
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.820]   reach their potential.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.660]   And one of the things that we spend a lot of time talking about is, all right, you don't
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.500]   like your job, but what are the moments, what are the bright spots right now in your day
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.180]   that you really, really do look forward to?
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.900]   I don't care how small they are.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.420]   I don't care if they last for literally just a minute, but what are those little interactions
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.820]   in your day that are the bright moments?
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.220]   Because misery in a lot of ways is it can be a very useful tool.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.340]   It can actually illuminate very clearly the parts of your world that you actually want
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.500]   to spend more time on.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.900]   It can be a very useful way to get to the moments that actually bring us joy.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.280]   And so by identifying these bright spots, you can start to see a pattern.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.820]   For me, for example, when you and I got to know each other, Chris, I think I was a startup
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.820]   entrepreneur, right?
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:27.940]   I was working in tech and I'd spent most of the past 10 years really trying to make that
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.940]   work.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.820]   And I guess to a certain degree, it was kind of working.
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.620]   I had a startup that had raised some money and it was doing reasonably well.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.700]   It wasn't hitting a home run, but it was doing reasonably well.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.620]   But I think the bigger thing was that I wasn't really enjoying being a startup founder.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.860]   Not nearly as much as I thought I was going to, right?
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.140]   I liked the idea of being a startup founder much more than I liked the act of being a
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.380]   startup founder.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.400]   But the day-to-day of what I was doing and managing and trying to build a product and
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.900]   looking at growth charts and figuring out the metrics, I wasn't that into that, to be
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.960]   honest with you.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.340]   But there was one part of my day that I always look forward to, and that was when I had a
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.980]   chance to hear customer stories.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.700]   Anytime when we had a health coaching business, we were helping people lose weight, then any
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.740]   time that I received an email or I got on the phone with a customer or I could hear
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:25.820]   some kind of story about how this was useful to them, what their life was like before,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.580]   what it was like during, and what has changed, that to me was like, it wasn't just interesting
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.100]   or validating, it set me on fire.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.520]   The idea of hearing that story, the idea of sharing that story, whether that be with teammates
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.580]   or whether that be in investors, I could feel literally my body come alive.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.820]   And in the days when I had that moment where I could talk, where I could tell stories,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.820]   I felt alive.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.940]   And in the days that I didn't, I felt completely vapid and blank.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:59.940]   So what that told me was like, hey, in this job that I know is not for me, I've identified
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.640]   this act of storytelling that I really, really like.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.140]   That's what convinced me to start sitting at my desk every morning before work to write.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.380]   I'm like, if you like to tell stories, you can just write to a page.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.020]   So I started to write every single morning.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.320]   Those are the things, those pages ultimately turned into blog posts and then turned into
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.460]   articles and now books.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.660]   It's interesting how we both went through this arc of startup founder.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.060]   It felt like an identity that suited us, but also at the same time didn't.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.700]   And here we are now both creating content as a future role, which is not what we originally
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.580]   intended and in some ways both stumbled on it.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.140]   When you talk about these questions to ask yourself, I'm curious if it's easier to ask
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:50.460]   yourself or to talk about it with a partner, talk about it with a family member or a friend.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.380]   Do you think one method or maybe it's different per person, but helps you uncover these things
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.380]   better?
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.660]   You know, you and I both, I think the last time we actually hung out, we were like talking
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.540]   about our partners and how like we would be like completely lost in our freaking lives
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   without them.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.540]   Right.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.860]   And I feel, I very much feel that way about Lina.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.660]   I guess there's two things about that.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:18.500]   One is that I have found it useful to spend some time thinking about things alone before
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.780]   I share with anybody, including Lina.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.220]   And the reason for that is because when I come up with a new idea or a new concept or
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.060]   I'm like, "Oh, you know, maybe this is something that I need to start doing or really focusing
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.660]   my time on."
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.740]   You know, that idea is always sort of like a newborn baby right at the gate.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.780]   And if you share it too early with people, it might be a little too fragile.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.780]   Right.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.820]   And so the way they respond to that might cut a little bit deeper than you sort of,
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.500]   you know, than you, that it might, if you gave it a few days where you could reflect
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   on it yourself.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   Right.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.620]   And build just maybe a little bit more conviction for it.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.620]   Right.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.620]   Here's why I'm into it.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.900]   And you can start to kind of poke holes in it yourself.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   So for me, for example, like the idea of writing a book, like, you know, writing a book is
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.700]   not like that is not a great way to make money.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   I knew that.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.700]   Right.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:15.100]   And writing a book is not a great way to necessarily, if you want to like be known and get your
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.300]   content out there, like, and get your ideas out there, like you're much better off like
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.600]   writing articles.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.220]   And so like when I started to think about writing a book, you know, I'm like, all right,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.420]   I'm going to spend the next two to three years.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.500]   Nobody is going to really know what I'm working on.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.780]   I'm not going to be able to share it with anybody.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.100]   There's a good chance that it's not going to make any money.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.100]   Right.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.340]   Like there are all these sort of things in my head.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.180]   And I needed to spend some time myself writing about this before I kind of went out and shared
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.860]   it with anybody, including Lena.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.620]   But then after I did, that's when I kind of opened it up and I went to a few people that
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.860]   I really trusted and said, hey, like, you know, what do you what do you think about
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.860]   this?
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.900]   But again, I think spending a little bit of time alone, you know, I call it in the book,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.260]   I call this sort of wandering time, like nonproductive wandering time and really kind of just like
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.380]   sitting with that idea for a little bit.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.020]   I think it really makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:10.980]   There's another hack I think would might be useful here that I have found extremely valuable,
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.860]   which is like, as soon as I found, as soon as I started to get more connected with my
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.220]   essence as a storyteller, all of a sudden, this world of options began to appear.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.580]   It was like, oh, you could start a podcast, you could write a book, you could do, you
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.580]   could write articles, you could, you know, you could be on stage like there are all these
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.420]   different ways, of course, you know, stand up comedy, there are all these different ways
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.860]   that you could express yourself as a storyteller, right?
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.780]   So then the question is like, how do, what do I do?
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.780]   Because like, that's too much stuff.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.900]   I can't do all that.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.660]   And so, one of the tools in the book is what I call a Dharma deck, a Dharma deck, which
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.620]   is anytime something like emotionally inspired me, I would literally write it down on an
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.620]   index card.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.980]   You know, you go take stand up comedy class, begin writing proposal for book.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:03.780]   And I would, over time, have this almost stack of index cards that I felt like were all options,
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.540]   all ways for me to express this essence of being a storyteller.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:11.500]   Now, what I would do is about once a week, I would go to a quiet place or take a walk,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.060]   and I would take that stack of index cards with me, and I would sort them from top to
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.060]   bottom.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.860]   The ones that had the most emotional pull for me, the ones that were calling me the
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.180]   most, stayed at the top of the pack.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.660]   The ones that didn't went to the bottom, bottom half of the pack.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.460]   And what you notice over time is that there would probably be like somewhere between one
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.700]   and three cards that will always just stay at the top of the pack, right?
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.300]   No matter what, it's like those are the ones that you don't want to give up.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.860]   And what I realized is like writing a book definitely stayed at the top of the pack for
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.340]   me, and that's why I decided to pursue it.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.620]   I love this.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.060]   It's funny because I think back to my Dharma, which I haven't quite figured out or my essence
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.060]   to say.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.820]   I haven't done all the work.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.340]   I've read the book, but haven't done the work.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.140]   But storytelling is a similar one.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.860]   I loved pitching a company.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.100]   I loved recruiting employees, telling them why we're doing this, what we're doing.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.900]   There are many hats you wear as a founder.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:09.860]   But that one for me was particularly moving for me, which is funny because now I'm similarly
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.740]   creating content down a different path.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.740]   But...
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.740]   This is what you're doing.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.180]   Back to your example with Karen, the nurse, I'm curious.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.780]   Is there some percentage and there's probably not an exact number of your job that needs
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.900]   to be associated with your essence in order for it to work?
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:33.420]   So I think to her example, if patient intake forms were 1% or 2% of her job, is that enough
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:40.700]   to sustain the other 98%, 99% that you maybe don't feel as connected with?
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.780]   Such a great question, Chris.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.900]   And I haven't been asked that question before.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:50.460]   And the answer is I don't know is the short answer.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:59.100]   What I will say is that the difference between 0% and 1% is like astronomical, right?
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:05.500]   Even having touch points with your dharma each day is I think something that can be
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.580]   a complete game changer for people.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.220]   In the case of Karen, this patient paperwork, you're right.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.340]   I mean, most of her time was probably spent talking to patients, right?
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.160]   But very few of it was actually spent writing these patient forms.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.140]   The sense that I get from her and from the other stories that are like this, like the
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.860]   assembly line worker who decided that they were going to actually create a record label,
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:38.140]   once you start having this touch point every day, you start to embody this persona, right?
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:43.620]   So for Karen, she may have been doing things that had nothing to do with being a writer.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.860]   She wasn't sitting down and she wasn't actually doing these patient forms, but she was meeting
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.620]   with patients.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.340]   One of the things that she was probably doing during that time is starting to think like
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.340]   a writer.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.520]   I want to hear your story.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.500]   And so I want to start asking you questions that go beneath the surface of the symptoms.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.820]   And I want to start learning more about your life, right?
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.940]   That was sort of her persona as a writer.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.620]   For me, same thing, storyteller, startup founder, two very different worlds.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.260]   But when I started to connect with myself as a storyteller, I started to feel like a
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.740]   storyteller at work, right?
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.980]   In fact, one of the things that I did is I actually wrote on a piece of paper, you are
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.500]   a storyteller.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.020]   And I kept that in my pocket.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:28.660]   And anytime I was sort of like, you know, in a place where I felt like, oh, I feel completely
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.020]   lost right now, or I feel like I'm like not doing what I meant to do, I'd pull out this
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.700]   piece of paper and I would remind myself, hey, you are a storyteller.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.780]   Now, did that mean that I like dropped everything I was doing and went and told stories?
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.780]   No.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.420]   What I mean is that when I went into the next meeting, I could embody myself as a storyteller,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   right?
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.620]   I kind of had this reminder of like, yeah, this is who I am, right?
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.900]   This is what I do.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.100]   And I'm expressing that in a way that feels maybe a little bit different than somebody
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.380]   who's writing novels or writing screenplays.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.300]   But I can still embody myself as a storyteller, even if I'm doing something that's not completely
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.540]   related to it right now.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.180]   And for people listening to this thinking, how do I take this essence of mine and embody
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.740]   it in my job?
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.540]   It doesn't actually always have to be in your role.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.980]   And this makes me think of a particular person.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.500]   My wife was at Lyft for 10 years and there was a guy named Paul.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.780]   And he was, you know, always had all energy and could connect with people.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.660]   And he volunteered and said, "Could I MC all hands for the company?
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.620]   Could I be the person that gets everyone excited for the meeting?
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.260]   I don't need to do all the presentations, but could I just run the all hands meeting?"
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:43.020]   And for almost a decade, he ran the all hands meeting and I didn't work there, but I think
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.300]   I probably went to one or two meetings, but it was like he brought that energy.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.260]   But that was 1%, 2%, 3% of his job.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.460]   He had an entire other job.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.360]   And so, whether you're the person that might volunteer to work the booths at the conferences
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:02.020]   your company goes to, there are opportunities maybe outside of even your role at any company
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.300]   where you might be able to bring some of this and go from that zero to one.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.660]   So I just encourage people to make their manager known.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.100]   Make it known to your manager what your thing you're trying to do is.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.100]   There might be opportunities you aren't thinking of.
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.100]   Totally.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.460]   It's such a good point, man.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.260]   Because I, again, I think like where we go to and where I went to for a very long time
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:30.260]   is, well, I need to have a particular job in order to express this essence of mine,
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.260]   right?
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.180]   I can't tell her, "Oh my gosh, that has nothing to do with startup founders, so I need to
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.300]   quit that job and I need to go do something else," but no, I'm not going to go quit that
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   job.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.300]   I have a team.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.940]   We've raised a little bit of money.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.940]   I have investors.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:48.580]   I can't do that, but I can start to find ways to express that through what I'm doing.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.980]   There's another story in the book about a woman who's a project manager inside a tech
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.860]   company, and she really wanted to be a teacher, right?
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.420]   And she talked to her husband about it, and they really went back and forth, and ultimately,
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.820]   they found financially, they could not make that work.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   They needed her healthcare insurance.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.100]   She was earning a pretty good salary.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.460]   They needed that to stay afloat.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.020]   The family's based in Detroit.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.140]   And so she was stuck in this moment where she was like, "Gosh, I wish that I could have
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.300]   wound the clock 15 years before, and I could have gone down the path of becoming a teacher
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.060]   because that would have made me really happy."
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.620]   And so every day, that's what was consuming her at work.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.140]   But when she sat down with a mentor of hers, she was able to dig down to the essence of
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.140]   what it was about teaching that ultimately made her come alive.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:37.340]   Then what ultimately made her come alive was that she loved helping people grow.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.500]   That's why she wanted to be up in front of a classroom.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.340]   That's what she wanted to be doing, working with students.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.620]   She wanted to be shaping the arc of people's careers.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.060]   And so the question then became, all right, well, okay, if teaching, obviously teaching
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.880]   is a very clear way to express that, what are the many other ways out there that are
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.340]   ways to express that?
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.860]   And what she found is learning and development inside a technology company is actually one
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.980]   way to do that.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.660]   So she started to throw her hat in the ring inside the same company for these opportunities
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.380]   that would allow her to take what she knew already about what the organization did and
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.580]   start to grow other people inside the company.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:17.940]   And so she did and flourished, became a huge rising star inside the company, started to
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.360]   speak on stage about how to develop and grow other people.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.460]   Her career completely bloomed and she never had to leave the company.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.180]   She never had to shift her industry.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.300]   She didn't have to lose her salary or the healthcare insurance.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.600]   I think that what I love about your show, Chris, is that in some ways, I see your audience
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.380]   as people who feel, I know when I listen to your show, I feel sort of stuck with something
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.240]   and you offer sort of a way to kind of get unstuck.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.700]   And that way is not necessarily always the most complex thing, which makes it beautiful,
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   right?
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.320]   Because of the beauty and the simplicity of it.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.660]   This might sound really simple, right?
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:59.320]   Like the idea of, well, connecting with the fact that she wanted to help people grow doesn't
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.400]   seem like an earth shattering insight.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   And that's the beauty of it.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.760]   It doesn't have to be, right?
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:09.720]   There's something inside of you that you can connect with and once you do, it just opens
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.920]   up all sorts of possibilities.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.800]   You asked me for other sort of tactics.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.360]   There's another one that I really love, which is like what I call the magazine walk, magazine
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   out walk.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.520]   And what I love to do is when I feel like I'm trying to explore what it is that makes
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.440]   me come alive, what's my essence, I'll go to a magazine aisle, whether it be in a bookstore
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.400]   or whether it be in an airport store, and I'll literally very carefully, slowly walk
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.280]   from one side of the magazine aisle to the other.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.120]   And I will try to tune out what it is that I feel like I should be picking up, right?
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.360]   Like I should be picking up the Wall Street Journal because I should be staying on top
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.900]   of the business news or I should be picking up Harvard Business Review because I need
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.760]   to be staying on top of what's written in that.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.480]   And I kind of tune that stuff out and I emotionally connect to what's actually really pulling
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   for me.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.040]   Like what magazine covers are really sort of grabbing my attention.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.400]   And slowly, and it's a very slow exercise, one by one, I'll pull out the magazines that
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.360]   are really vying for my attention emotionally.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.200]   And if I then lay those magazines out on a table, I'm like, "Oh, okay, well, it's pretty
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.280]   clear," right?
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.360]   And for me, like when I started doing the magazine aisle walk, I was living in Detroit
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.520]   at the time and I would literally go to this local library and I would walk from one side
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.360]   of the magazine aisle to the other, inevitably, it would end up being a combination of like
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.000]   storytelling oriented stuff.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.680]   So it'd be like script writing, movies, books.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.560]   But the other that really surprised me was spirituality, right?
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:48.400]   And to me, I've never really been like a big spirituality guy, but I realized that there
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.720]   was a lot that was pulling at me.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.680]   Articles by Ram Dass and Maria Popova and Ryan Holiday even, the stuff that they were
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:02.640]   writing about like stoicism, philosophy, and spirituality was pulling me in a really, really
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.040]   deep way.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.640]   One of the reasons I ended up writing this book is because I was like, "Wow, a combination
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.120]   of like getting into this ancient philosophy and also being able to tell stories that bring
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.640]   that to real life in the modern day, I couldn't think of a better way to spend my time."
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.200]   Well, I'm very fortunate you have.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.920]   And we talked a lot about exercise to spend time on, time you spend on work, thinking
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:32.520]   about time, but I want to move to prana because it's not always about time.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.120]   So maybe let's jump in here.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.520]   I mean, prana, the definition of prana is like this extraordinary energy.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.280]   This is like almost think of like a tank of energy that all of us have, but we don't always
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.880]   know how to access that.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.360]   And one of the reasons for that is because when we think about investing in a project
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.800]   or investing in an idea, the thing that we are so conditioned to think about is like
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.000]   time, right?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.160]   How much time am I going to give something?
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   And ultimately what tends to matter most when we look at sort of great projects that have
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.840]   come alive across all of these different industries wasn't really time, but it was heart.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.000]   How much heart did you really give that?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.320]   That's why you see movies like The Clockwork Orange that were written in a few days, right?
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.600]   Great Gatsby, all these great works.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.280]   They were written in a fraction of the amount of time that you might think because all of
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   a sudden there was this creative burst of inspiration and they were to sit down and
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   just like really, really bang it out.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.240]   And that's just kind of proof that like what we're really trying to optimize here for is
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.960]   heart and not time, right?
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.560]   And so it's much better to be fully like full hearted with your dharma than it is to be
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   fully scheduled.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.040]   And you know, the example that like is very similar, I know like you've had like people
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.080]   talk about meditation on this show.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.440]   You know, I went and spent time at like, you know, a monastery and what I was kind of surprised
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.360]   by, I guess I'm surprised now to have been surprised, but at the time I kind of expected
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.640]   that these monks were like sitting around and meditating all day.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.120]   And the truth is they weren't, right?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.960]   They were meditating for three or four hours a day, but the rest of that time was spent
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.360]   like working the land, doing all the stuff that they needed to do, doing the duties that
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.580]   they needed in order to make the place actually function, right?
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.600]   But their life was dedicated to meditation.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.980]   The point being that just because you're dedicating your life to something, just because you care
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:31.020]   about it doesn't necessarily mean you're spending every waking hour doing that thing.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.800]   What is more important is that you're finding ways to really bring your best prana, your
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.720]   best energy and your best heart to those moments.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:45.280]   So, you know, for me, like, you know, writing for a half hour every morning is way, way
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.300]   better and produces much stronger longterm results than if I was actually spending two
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.520]   hours in the afternoon writing, it's just, it's just literally the degradation of my
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   brain.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.280]   It's literally the degradation of my creative horsepower.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.960]   I mean, I can sit down and I can write, but it's not going to end up being any of the
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.640]   pearls that ultimately make it into the book.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.080]   Like 99% of what I write ends up in a trash bin, right?
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.940]   And so what I'm looking for is like these little pearls in this, you know, in this piles
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.080]   of horseshit that I write each day.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.580]   And it turns out that like the little pearls are much more likely to appear in that half
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.400]   hour morning session than a two hour writing block in the afternoon, right?
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.760]   I know that about myself.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.100]   And so for me, my dharma is to write and to tell stories, but it's not like I spent all
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.980]   day every day like doing that.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.660]   I mean, I've got kids, I've got, I've got other, I've got other work that pays the bills,
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.600]   you know, there's, there's, there's a lot of other things going on, but I have to make
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.440]   sure to have this commitment.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.720]   The second thing about that then is like, how do we, how do we then like condition ourselves
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.480]   so that we have the right energy at the right moment, right?
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.860]   And for me, this was sort of a big breakthrough, which is that like, I've always sort of looked
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.200]   at rest and recovery as something that you did in long periods, right?
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.120]   So I would, I would take myself to a breaking point.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.840]   I would take myself to the red and then I would say, I need a vacation, right?
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.320]   And my wife and I, we would plan this.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.080]   We'd be like, Hey, like we have this one week vacation scheduled.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.120]   I would literally look at three months between now and then, and I'd kill myself, right?
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.440]   But the problem with that is I would literally return back from vacation with less gas in
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.560]   the tank than before that three, three month period even started.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   Right?
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.760]   And, and the science kind of bears this out.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.200]   I mean, most people actually return from vacation and say they're more stressed one week after
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.680]   they return than one week before they left.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   Right?
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.400]   Point being like vacations are like a wonderful, can be a wonderful thing.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.880]   They're great for reconnecting with family and seeing new places and spending time with
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.920]   friends, but they're actually not, they're actually not as effective an instrument for
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.320]   dealing with burnout than we may assume.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.560]   What tends to work much, much better is when you can actually have frequent focused recoveries
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.360]   throughout the day, every single day.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.980]   In fact, like average, like average high performers, whether it be in business or be in music or
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:14.340]   be in sports, they're taking somewhere around eight breaks every single day, right?
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:20.420]   Eight, about one an hour throughout a work day, which like I know sounds extraordinary,
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:26.140]   but when I started to put this into practice, I used what I call the 55/5 model, which is
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.100]   like for every 55 minutes of work, I'm taking five minutes of focused recovery.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.100]   Right?
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.740]   And that five minutes can be doing anything, like literally anything.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.420]   It can be sipping on a cup of coffee, it can be doing pushups, it can be taking a walk
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.180]   to the mailbox and back, like doing whatever it is you're doing, but you're not multitasking
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.180]   it.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.220]   You don't have your phone with you when you're doing it and you're like, you're like getting
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.700]   some like quasi rest and quasi sort of work done at the same time, those five minutes
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.660]   are deliberately nonproductive.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.780]   You're focused on rest and people have a very hard time with this.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.820]   I know I did.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.260]   And the reason for that is because what we feel like we're doing, again, we're in a time
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:07.940]   based model, is that we're shrinking the amount of time, productive time we have in our day,
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.940]   right?
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.340]   You already feel squeezed as is.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.900]   If you're shrinking five minutes from every hour and you're working, let's say nine hours
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.980]   a day, you're shrinking your schedule by 45 minutes, which is significant, right?
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.860]   We could use that 45 minutes.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.940]   But if you give this a shot, what I can almost promise you based on experience from myself
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.860]   and from watching others put this into practice, is that five minutes is going to make the
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.940]   other 55 minutes far more productive, far more effective, far more imaginative.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.740]   You're going to be far more collaborative, like all the things that we associate with
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.740]   success.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:45.020]   You will have more of that in the next 55 minutes than you did if you were just waiting
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:51.620]   to the end of the day to finally like unload and burn yourself out because it's just clearly
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.900]   not working.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.500]   As I read this and as you talk about it, I think about how Google has this speedy meetings
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.980]   feature where you can say set these meetings to 25 minutes for like a 30 minute meeting
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.100]   is now by default 25 and an hour meeting is by default 50.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.580]   But it takes the ability to turn the meeting off at 50 because so often it's like, "Oh,
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.900]   I know no one on this call scheduled the next 10 minutes so we could just run over."
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.500]   And then I was thinking about, I remember when I had a Zoom account that was free and
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.940]   it's like, "Oh, there's that timer."
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.180]   And it's like, "This meeting is going to run out and we are going to turn it off."
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.900]   And I've been in meetings like that.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.260]   So if anyone out there knows of a way that I could hack Google Calendar and Google Meet
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:34.220]   to just actually shut the meeting down at 50 minutes to force everyone to end, I would
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.940]   love to see that feature in action because I find it hard.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.780]   I can schedule the five or 10 minute break, but it's really hard to actually take it.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.500]   It's funny because I'm on all these different platforms now for virtual stuff and you are
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   too.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.300]   And I noticed like on Microsoft Teams, when they set the meeting for a certain length,
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.740]   they will actually say, "Five minutes left in the meeting," and then they'll have a countdown
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.740]   timer.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.780]   Now, I don't think it actually shuts off at that time, but the fact that there's actually
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.620]   a bit of a countdown timer, I do find to be somewhat helpful.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.000]   It's like, "Hey, this is the meeting you called.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.080]   These are the people whose schedule you're dealing with.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   Everybody is assuming this one thing.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.580]   Let's put a little bit of a countdown timer in the last five minutes."
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.740]   I find that to be somewhat helpful.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   But I agree with you, man.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.860]   I was the kind of guy who, if I had two extra minutes in between meetings, I would go to
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   my to-do list and I would grab like, "Oh, what can I knock out?
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.220]   What can I knock out quickly?"
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.700]   And to be a little bit of an energetic hit that I would get from that.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:39.100]   But the problem was that throughout the day, like clockwork, I would end up slumping.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:44.420]   At the end of the day, I was far less energized than I was at the beginning of the day.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.900]   And that hurt because there were some times where there was key meetings, key moments
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.380]   that were in the afternoons.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.740]   I remember when I was raising money, even, and I was out there pitching investors, yeah,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.100]   some meetings were in the morning when I was fresh, but there were a lot of meetings that
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.540]   were in the afternoon.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:07.540]   And so I know that looking back, I would perform with far less quality, I would be far less
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.580]   compelling in those afternoon meetings than I was in the morning.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.380]   And part of the reason for that is because that morning I was spent grinding.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.100]   And then I would walk straight into that meeting and I would take all the baggage from that
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.100]   grind.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.340]   And then I would take time to kind of reset myself.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.260]   Maybe if you look at people who I think are like, if you strap for time, who do this very
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.380]   well, and they don't have five minutes, I think one of the most important things you
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:35.300]   can do is to provide some type of transition for yourself in between two big moments, right?
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.540]   And again, if you only have 30 seconds, even if you have 10 seconds, it is deliberately
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.780]   saying I'm going to be nonproductive for a period of time.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.500]   And the difference between zero and 10 seconds, whether it's closing your eyes and taking
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.540]   a breath or literally getting up and stretching, doing something will be like game changing,
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.540]   right?
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.660]   If you're having these transitions throughout.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.860]   And it's different for everyone.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.820]   For me, the afternoon meetings and the afternoon pitches were actually really great because
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.500]   I didn't have anything to worry about.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.940]   If I go into a meeting at eight, I'm all these things, what came in overnight?
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.860]   What emails do I have to respond to?
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.700]   But by the afternoon, I've been able to catch up on all the other stuff.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.460]   So I think it really depends on a per person basis.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.800]   Sometimes my wife asks, "Why were you up till two in the morning last night?"
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.140]   Because we both have to get up, we have kids, we got to get up at six to seven, the kids
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.140]   are up, we're up.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.240]   And I was like, "Well, I just had this bout of energy.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:36.260]   And I felt like I could get done in two hours what I would normally take 10 hours to do."
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.260]   And so I can catch...
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:42.900]   Now, the hard part is forcing yourself to use that time you saved to actually recover.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.980]   But sometimes when I find this prana, I'm like, "Let's capture it when it's there."
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.020]   And sometimes it surprises me.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   That's a really good point, man.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.140]   We can't always count on prana.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.480]   It's tough to predict when your prana is going to be really high.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.200]   There are patterns for sure.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:09.180]   For me, I remember when I was at the office day in and day out, I would try to work out
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.180]   in the middle of the day.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.640]   I had a newborn at home.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   The mornings were very tough.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.180]   And when I went home, I wanted to spend time with the family.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.460]   So I try to work out at around 12 o'clock.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.100]   And then I would end up scheduling meetings at one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock,
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.100]   four o'clock.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.260]   But what I found is that after I finished working out, I felt really good.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.440]   I felt really creative and awesome.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:36.180]   And I was like, "All right, well, why am I scheduling a mundane meeting at one o'clock
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.180]   in that case?
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.140]   I should be scheduling a block of time, at least a half hour, where I can get back from
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:45.220]   the gym and I can go to my desk and I actually can write down a few things that are really
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.220]   important.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.300]   I can spend some time doing some deep work."
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.460]   And when I did that, that changed things as well.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.420]   I mean, it's a great point.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.800]   Figure out where the pockets of your day are where you tend to have your highest prana.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.860]   But then also, sometimes it'll just happen spontaneously.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.580]   And when it does, try to give yourself enough flex where you can capture it.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.960]   Yep, I definitely do that a lot.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.140]   We talked a lot about breaks.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.620]   There's one break that you referenced in the book that I thought was super interesting
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.580]   and it's a worry break.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.340]   So this one surprised me as well.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.340]   I ran into a leader who had a sand timer on his desk.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:28.380]   A lot of what I do for work is I go out and I study people who are at the top of their
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.820]   game and I try to unpack their habits.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:37.020]   And in this case, what he had a reputation for was being very, very calm, even though
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.700]   he worked inside a very cutthroat culture.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.660]   People loved working for him and he had exceptional results.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.500]   The board loved him, the rest of the C-suite loved him.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.260]   So I wanted to figure out what it was.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.580]   Was he naturally like this or were there some hacks, some things that he put into practice?
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.280]   And I noticed a sand timer on his desk and I asked him about it.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.060]   And he said that what he would do is every time there was a worrying thought, something
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.420]   that was nagging at him and it wouldn't go away, what he would do is he would go into
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.300]   his office and he would shut the door and he would take this five minute timer and he
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.560]   would flip it over.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.020]   And for five minutes, he would focus on nothing but that one worry.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.380]   So I was like, "Okay, that's pretty interesting.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.420]   What if it's something that you don't really have control over?"
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.300]   He's like, "It doesn't matter.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.460]   I'll spend five minutes worrying about it anyway."
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.940]   And I was like, "Well, I got to be honest with you.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.420]   This is like, this doesn't sound great to me.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.660]   It sounds like a recipe for anxiety more than anything else."
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.820]   But as I dug deeper into it, what I realized is that there's a lot of science behind this
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.660]   practice of taking a worry break.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.700]   And the reason for that is because when we have a worrying thought inside our head, what
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.940]   we tend to do, a lot of us will tend to try to push it out or compartmentalize it and
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.060]   to basically say, "Hey, I don't have time for you right now.
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.180]   I'm focusing on this other thing."
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.420]   When we push things out, what they tend to do is they tend to grow louder.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.780]   So what started as a whisper will grow into a conversation and eventually it will grow
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.100]   into a shout, right?
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.480]   It wants to be heard.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.220]   It's kind of like kids in that way.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.880]   Worrying thoughts want to be heard, and if they're not heard, they're going to continue
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.960]   to get louder and louder and louder.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.660]   There's a saying in positive psychology that you may have heard, which is like, "What
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.260]   you resist persists," right?
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.260]   And so counterintuitively, while we may think we're doing ourselves a service by trying
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:29.200]   to push these thoughts out because they're not positive, we're actually giving them a
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.460]   lot more runway inside our head.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.140]   They're actually becoming louder and louder.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.220]   Counterintuitively, one of the things we can do is we can actually say, "All right, I'm
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.120]   going to give you a fixed amount of time.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.220]   I'm going to sit down and I'm going to give this nagging worry five minutes of my time.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.100]   And for that five minutes, I'm going to stay true to it.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.380]   I'm literally going to do nothing but worry about this one thing."
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.980]   And strangely enough, what will happen at the end of that five minutes is that it won't
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.780]   be that the worry went away.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.100]   You may not have a problem for this.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.580]   It might not even be something you have control over.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.380]   But what it will do in almost all cases, I've noticed, is it will actually turn the volume
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:12.220]   down on the worry so that now you can actually get on with the other parts of your day because
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   it felt heard, because it wasn't something that you were trying to push out.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.540]   You gave it its due time and now it settles a little bit more.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.540]   I love this.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.520]   It's almost like you can exhaust the worrying where you're like, "Well, I don't have anything
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:30.580]   else to say to worry about it and maybe the next time it goes away."
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:36.740]   On a higher note than worrying about the worst in the world, let's talk about elevating things
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.060]   to be a little happier, a little more exciting.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.460]   Let's talk about Leela.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:48.020]   Leela is really think of it as the blend of work and play.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:55.060]   How do we start to think of work a little bit more like play?
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.740]   It sounds probably cheesy.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.860]   I know the first time I thought of Leela and I started digging into this really ancient
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.860]   practice.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.140]   I'm like, "Well, it sounds very lovely, but it doesn't sound quite practical."
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.100]   You work hard and then you play hard.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.620]   That's the mentality we've been brought into.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   But then I started to see these really top performers.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:20.220]   People like Phil Jackson, NBA coach, but it was also a player who literally, as he was
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:26.340]   a player, wrote in his locker room on a piece of scotch tape, "Make work your play and play
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.780]   your work."
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.300]   That was the mentality that he brought into the NBA as a coach.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   Look at what he did.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.340]   One of the most winningest coaches of all time.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.540]   He raised greats like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.580]   Those guys, when they talked about Phil Jackson, they would talk about that philosophy in particular,
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.420]   and they would say that is the thing that they ultimately ended up learning the most
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.620]   from him, which was to blur the lines between work and play.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:57.220]   Because when you do, you can actually reach even more exceptional results.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.540]   In all the concepts in the book, I really tried to find where it was echoed.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:08.780]   These Eastern concepts that were over a thousand years old.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.920]   What was happening in the world of science, and what has happened in the world of science
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.060]   that provides some grounding for these?
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.820]   In all cases, I could find something.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:21.540]   In this case, for Lila, it really came from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and his work around
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.620]   flow.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:27.660]   If you look at the state of flow, what he was really talking about in many cases was
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:32.500]   being able to feel like even though you were working, there was a notion of play that was
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.160]   associated with it.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.500]   One of the things that Csikszentmihalyi made a distinction of is people who tend to be
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.260]   exotelic versus autotelic.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.140]   Exotelic means that they are focused purely on the goal, the result of the work they're
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.140]   doing.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:51.420]   But the people who are autotelic were the people who were focused on the process and
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.780]   enjoying the point from here to there.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.300]   The assumption that I think a lot of us make is that the people who achieve the top of
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.700]   their game are exotelic by nature.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.780]   By the way, we're kind of a blend of all of them.
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.740]   We're not one or the other.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:09.580]   We kind of tilt one side or the other, but the assumption that we, I think, make sometimes
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:15.380]   is that people who achieve the medals, people who get to the very, very top are the ones
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.380]   who are exotelic.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.980]   They're the ones who are focused on the prize.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.060]   That's what they really want and they will not rest until they get it.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.740]   What Csikszentmihalyi, I think, did an exceptional job of in his body of work around flow was
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.620]   showing how there was just as many people out there who tended to tilt autotelic, who
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:37.660]   tended to focus much more on enjoying the process, getting some joy out of that, because
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:42.740]   when you got joy out of something, you wanted to keep doing it over and over again.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:50.620]   One of the techniques that we talk about in this chapter is what I call high-quality habits.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.020]   The business that I had started before really focused on health habits.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.500]   How do we build health habits into our life?
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:01.220]   One of the things I realized is when we're trying to get somebody to lose weight and
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:08.300]   they loved bread and they loved pasta, but they decided to go on a carb-free diet, it
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:13.220]   would last for a short amount of time and sometimes you would see people who got exceptional
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:20.380]   results quickly, but it very rarely lasted, almost entirely on all cases that we studied.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.380]   We work with tens of thousands of people.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.820]   They would end up yo-yoing back to the condition they were in before.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.620]   On the other hand, when we found people who adopted what I call a high-quality habit,
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:34.060]   which is a habit that they want to do over and over again, they actually love the habit.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:40.660]   For example, drinking two glasses of water before every meal, which is a habit that some
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.900]   people can get really into.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.100]   It can be really fun.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.700]   You can put little mixes into your water, electrolytes.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.220]   You can have cool-looking bottles.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.500]   It can become part of your persona and there's a lot of fun that can come from that.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:57.620]   People who were able to adopt that habit, we saw end up having lasting results because
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.060]   they were eating less.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.180]   They were having more energy throughout their day and it was something that they just wanted
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.180]   to continue with.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.980]   I think the same is true for our dharma.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.300]   There are certain things that we want to bring into our lives and we're like, "I don't really
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.620]   want to do that, but I feel like I should do that," and those habits very rarely stick.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.940]   On the other hand, finding something that you really actually enjoy doing, something
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.980]   that you want to do over and over again, I think it was Kevin Kelly and I quote him in
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.980]   the book.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.780]   I always butcher his quote, but he's like, "We spend so much time in our lives trying
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.380]   to figure out better ways to do tasks."
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:39.020]   What we need to be doing is we need to be spending time in our lives figuring out what
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:44.820]   tasks we want to do over and over again because we actually love it.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.620]   When you can find those things, when you can find those habits, you're on a clear path
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.100]   to sort of blurring this line between work and play.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:57.900]   In the health example, I'm sure cutting carbs would probably be more effective than just
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.220]   drinking two glasses of water.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   In the short term.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.380]   In the short term, but I guess in the long term, if you bring it back, the water is more
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.380]   helpful.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:11.060]   I mean, this is exactly what would happen is we would see people because the platform
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:15.380]   that I started was called Rise and you were matched with a health coach, so you had one
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.100]   person that you were working with.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.660]   The number of people who were like, "I'm cutting carbs and this is what I'm doing,"
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:28.740]   or the people who had cut carbs and then gained it all back, it was almost cliche to talk
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.660]   about because it would happen all of the time.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:40.780]   People who went on paleo and lost like 30 pounds and they felt fantastic and then ended
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.900]   up gaining it all back.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.740]   We saw that, I guess, way more often than the people who were actually able to keep
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.740]   it off.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.940]   Now, I think the point of this all isn't to knock on paleo.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:58.340]   The point of it is if you're suffering as a result of paleo, if you really like carbs
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:04.500]   as something you enjoy and you're denying yourself that, then that is not a high quality
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.660]   habit because it's not something that you want to put on repeat.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.820]   For that reason, it makes it much, much harder to stick to.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:16.580]   You're basically cashing in on your willpower every single day, which is a very hard thing
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:21.100]   to do and it becomes even harder when you have other things going on in your life.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.740]   You're busy, work picks up, things are happening at home.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.940]   It becomes even harder to keep a high quality habit.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.380]   On the other hand, something like water, again, to your point, it's not the kind of thing
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.360]   you're going to shed weight with very quickly, but it's the kind of thing that you can keep
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.620]   in place over time so that people that we saw that not only lost the 20, 30 pounds that
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:46.100]   they were looking to lose, but actually kept it off, were the ones who adopted these really,
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.540]   really simple habits that they actually really wanted to put on repeat.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:56.620]   So dieting, sports, how does Leela fit into a more traditional workplace?
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:01.940]   I think Leela fits into traditional workplaces when we can start to find the little things
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:10.340]   throughout the day that actually give us some joy and also help us find our dharma.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:15.100]   For me, for example, with the storytelling, finding little pockets, little moments of
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:19.460]   the day when I was actually sitting down and I was actually writing, and I would do this
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.260]   just for five minutes every day, five minute pockets throughout the day.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.940]   I was sitting down and I was starting to spend some time actually writing these ideas, and
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.580]   that was these little pockets of joy.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.040]   That was a habit that I want to put on repeat.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:37.340]   The other one that I feel like is really helpful was when I talk about Toni Morrison, who's
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:41.620]   a single mom, she had two kids at home.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.860]   She had a full-time job, but she really wanted to write.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:52.620]   For her, the high-quality habit started when she started waking up a half hour early before
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:57.860]   the kids were up, and she'd have her cup of coffee, she'd watch the sunrise, and she would
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.660]   just brainstorm and daydream about what are the ideas that I would want to bring to life
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:03.660]   through a novel.
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:07.180]   She would really just start to write these ideas down.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.740]   It's not like a book happened immediately, just the same way that if you were drinking
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.780]   water throughout the day every day, you're not going to lose weight immediately.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   But those mornings, that high-quality habit ended up being the thing that ended up being
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.860]   sort of like all the inspiration that she ended up turning into her books, became a
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:29.260]   Nobel Prize-winning author as a result of those mornings.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:34.500]   What is that thing for you that you feel like you enjoy so much, and again, it's not like
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.060]   something that you feel like you have to do, but you actually kind of want to do, and how
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.100]   do you then start to build that into your day in some small way?
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.100]   Would that be in the morning?
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.300]   Would that be sprinkled throughout your day?
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.260]   What's that thing that you feel like you can put on repeat?
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:56.140]   Yeah, it almost feels like if Sooka is finding your essence, Leela is bringing your essence
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:01.020]   into your daily routine so that it feels more like fun.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:06.460]   Yeah, well said, man, because I think that we talk a lot.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:12.540]   Whenever I think there are conversations about purpose and meaning, sometimes we can tend
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:18.220]   to focus on finding what that thing is for you, and maybe not enough time talking about
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:25.100]   what it is that we need to do in order to fit this into a busy, overwhelmed, fast-paced
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.540]   modern schedule.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.740]   I think Leela is one of those answers.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.260]   I think it tees us up perfectly.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:35.380]   I wanted to last talk about Kriya, which is that if you don't actually take action on
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.780]   all of this, what is there?
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.300]   Maybe let's close there.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.060]   We didn't hit on all of the principles.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.980]   We didn't hit on the I don't even know how many rituals and tactics you put in the book,
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.980]   but there were so many.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.260]   Obviously, there will be more that people need to go find elsewhere, but this felt like
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.060]   a good way to wrap it all up.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.180]   I mean, there's over 30 rituals in the book.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.460]   I kind of look at this as sort of, in some ways, like a menu.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.100]   There are things that are going to work for some people, and there's things that are going
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.460]   to work better for other people, but being able to sort of test these different things
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:13.980]   in your life, I think, are the ways, the paths that we can use to, I think, figure out what
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.340]   it is that makes us come alive and express that.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:22.780]   With Kriya, with action, nothing happens unless we have movement, right?
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.280]   We can sit behind a desk and we can talk about purpose all day, but how do we put purpose
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.660]   into action?
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:34.780]   The thing that I love about sort of like Kriya is that there are really some great tools
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:41.300]   today that I think I had to kind of figure out how to ... When I started to put them
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.180]   into practice myself, it really started to kind of change things for me.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:49.920]   One example of that is the two-way door versus the one-way door.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.460]   You may have heard Jeff Bezos talk about this because he talked about it in a couple of
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.580]   his shareholder letters.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:00.380]   But basically, the premise is that oftentimes, when we are thinking about a decision, taking
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:08.220]   action on something that we want to go do, it is very easy to confuse that as a one-way
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:13.860]   door, meaning that if you go through and it doesn't work, you're not going to be able
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.700]   to come back through when it's actually a two-way door, right?
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.100]   You go through, doesn't work, you're able to come back to where you were before, right?
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:25.140]   You may have lost a little bit of time, but you probably gained a lot of information and
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.580]   a lot of experience along the way as well.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:31.660]   The bigger point is that oftentimes, we treat these decisions with such weight and with
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:38.060]   such gravity that if we do it, it's like we're walking into an abyss where we have to make
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.740]   it work when the reality is that there will be other options.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.180]   Other doors will open, plus you will always be able to walk back through.
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:51.140]   For me, running for office was that thing.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:57.380]   I felt compelled for a while to want to move back to my hometown outside of Detroit and
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.380]   run for office.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.460]   I was really, really scared about it.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:05.300]   I was scared for a lot of reasons, but one of them was I felt like if I did that, I was
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.100]   going to torpedo my career.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:12.420]   I'd spent 10 years in Silicon Valley, I'd been working as a startup founder, I'd developed
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.700]   all these relationships, and I felt like I'd finally found a way to financially make a
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.180]   place like San Francisco work and here I am, I'm going to torpedo all that and move back
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.460]   to Detroit and run for office, and I really wanted to.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.740]   I really wanted to get involved, but at the same time, I felt like it was going to blow
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.020]   everything up.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.100]   It wasn't until I really started to think about it as like, "Hey, listen, this is not
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.780]   a one-way door.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.340]   You go and you lose.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.700]   There will be other doors that will open, and if they don't, for whatever reason, you
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.780]   will always be able to walk back through.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.460]   What you will have lost may be a little bit of time, but what you will have gained is
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:49.760]   a lot of wisdom, and you'll never regret not having done this thing that you were emotionally
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.060]   pulled to do."
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.860]   That is ultimately what got me through.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.700]   It wasn't some burst of courage.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.660]   People would always say, "That's a very gutsy thing to run for office and to leave everything
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:04.340]   behind and go do that and move your family to Detroit," and I was like, "Well, I thank
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.020]   you for saying that, but not really."
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:10.500]   For me, it really came down to this idea of I actually don't have a lot of courage here.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:17.420]   I am very scared, but I'm also grounded in the idea that if this doesn't work, I'm not
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.180]   going to be in a place of complete pointlessness.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.900]   I can come back through the door because it is a two-way door.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.860]   I can always move back to Silicon Valley if that was what I chose to do.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.980]   I can always go back into working into tech.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.820]   It may take a little while to find something, but I will.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.420]   I have to have some belief in that because it's true.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.420]   Ultimately, the other thing that might happen is it may open up many other doors for me,
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.960]   which is what happened.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:48.380]   I went to Detroit, I gave it my all, I knocked on over 10,000 doors, election results come
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.540]   back in, and I lose.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.300]   As a result of that, everything had changed.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:59.180]   I had learned so much about myself in that process.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.140]   I learned about what I cared about.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:06.500]   I learned about what I want to spend my days doing that at the end, I was like, "I don't
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.700]   want to move back to Silicon Valley.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.780]   I want to start getting on stage the way that I was during the campaign.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.900]   I want to start speaking to audiences.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:19.860]   I came up with the idea for a television show, which I'm now making with American Express."
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:25.060]   All that stuff happened when I was on the campaign and as really as a result of doing
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.060]   that.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:32.780]   Again, the thing that I would encourage anybody who's listening right now to take a decision
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.980]   in your life.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.340]   Just take a decision that you're thinking about, something that maybe you're afraid
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:43.260]   to do, and ask yourself deep down, "Is this a one-way door, or is this a two-way door?"
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:47.900]   Because there are some one-way doors out there, but the vast majority of decisions out there
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.580]   are not one-way doors, they're two-way doors.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:54.580]   If it's a two-way door, the only thing I would say is lower the bar a little bit.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:59.340]   Don't feel like you need to have this abundance of courage or guts in order to go do this
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.860]   thing that you want to do.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.380]   Instead, ground yourself in the fact that even if you do it and it doesn't work out,
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.860]   you're going to be okay.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.420]   You can always walk back through.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:13.380]   I think far too many people think decisions are not reversible, and I watched a great
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.380]   talk on speed when it comes to building products and building companies.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:21.300]   It's like, if a decision is reversible, just make the decision.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:25.900]   It's like almost default to a decision, and then you can come back to it later.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:33.140]   But another tactic you mentioned that I really liked was to make it to do less hard, less
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.740]   to overcome, make it to learn.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:36.860]   Please share that a little bit.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:42.260]   I spent, like so many people, every January 1st coming up with, "Here are my to-do lists
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.260]   for the year.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.980]   Here are my big goals."
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:53.320]   Like many people, I would abandon that list, stop looking at it sometime in February.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.820]   What I found to be much more gripping and I think compelling for me was when I started
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.460]   to think of it less as a to-do list but a to-learn list.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:07.020]   What are the things that I actually want to learn how to do right now?
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:10.040]   Here's where I want to grow.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:19.020]   For me, even though it's a little bit hard sometimes to quantify that, it makes it just
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.940]   far more exciting.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:25.760]   For me, for example, I wanted to learn how to develop a television show.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:33.060]   When I write that down, all of a sudden, now it opens up all of these ways that I can do
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   it.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:39.780]   But I think the most important thing it does for me is it makes me less afraid to fail.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:45.140]   Because we all know that failure is a wonderful teacher and success can be a really lousy
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.000]   teacher.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.560]   If my to-do list is I need to have a show up and running by the end of the year, well,
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.820]   all of a sudden, I'm jammed with fear and insecurity to the point that I actually don't
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:58.620]   want to look at that goal anymore.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.660]   But if my goal is to learn how to develop a show, well, then I know that I need to put
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   myself out there.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:05.500]   I know I need to actually start doing the work.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.260]   I know I need to start meeting with people.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:10.780]   I know I need to start getting into the nitty-gritty of what it takes to actually pull something
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.060]   off in Hollywood.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:17.780]   But it no longer makes me so afraid of going out there because I know I'm going to probably
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:22.580]   fall on my ass a few times while I'm doing it and that's okay because I'm actually satisfying
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:27.460]   this to learn objective, which is I want to know how to create a television show.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:31.320]   I think especially even going back to the beginning of this conversation on your finding
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.980]   your essence, just learning more things can help you explore.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.180]   And so, I think back to one of the reasons I partnered with Masterclass was that I found
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.720]   it to be such a great tool to go watch videos, be like, "I like storytelling.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.300]   Do I like stand-up comedy?
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.980]   Let's go learn what it takes to actually do this professionally."
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   You know what?
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   I don't think that's me.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.700]   Like, you know, I like telling jokes, but I don't think it's a career.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:57.900]   And so, I think the more you can expose yourself to learning other things, the more you can
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:02.540]   kind of come up with ideas of what ignites you and what doesn't.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:07.020]   And it's so much easier than like that would have been a much easier thing to do than like
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.700]   do a stand-up routine, which is a loftier goal.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.180]   Maybe I would learn more from it.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:17.620]   But even just learning how the industry works was a much easier goal to accomplish, you
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.260]   know, from the safety of my own living room.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   Totally.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.340]   So, I feel like we didn't even brush the surface.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.600]   There's a lot more there.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.180]   Where can people kind of get the rest?
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.180]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.060]   So, the book is out.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.460]   It literally just came out yesterday.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.460]   And you can find it.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.460]   You can find it everywhere.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.460]   It's on Amazon.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.460]   It's on Barnes & Noble.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.540]   So, wherever you get your books, it is available in print and audio as well.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.180]   And it's called "Everyday Dharma".
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.180]   Awesome.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.900]   Did you do the audio or who's reading?
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.900]   I did.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.900]   I did the audio.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.900]   And, you know, it's funny.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.540]   I recorded it at this booth in Santa Monica.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:59.500]   And a lot of what's inside the book are, you know, the stories of like my ancestors.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:04.660]   Like I tell the story of my grandfather and our first conversation about dharma.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.060]   And it was just a bizarre experience, Chris.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:13.740]   I mean, it's funny because I started to cry during the actual reading, you know.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.260]   And the sound engineer is kind of in my ear and I got my headphones on and I realized
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.900]   like he's crying as I'm reading it as well.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:26.140]   So, like if you hear me kind of breaking up, like during the audible recording at a point,
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.140]   it's because I'm weeping.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:32.420]   Well, I feel like now I got to go back and listen to try to find those moments.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.220]   But thank you so much for writing it.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.060]   I love all the tactics.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.980]   I think anyone listening to this show, you know, knows that one of my passions is not
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.300]   just learning about how to make change, but the specific actions and tactics and in the
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.620]   case of your book, you know, 30 plus rituals.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.340]   So really love that.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.340]   Really enjoyed the book.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.940]   Thank you so much for sharing it and joining me today.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.460]   Chris, this is awesome.
