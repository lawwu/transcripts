[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.960]   ♪
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   I've taught public school for 26 years.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.660]   But I just can't do it anymore.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.700]   For years, I asked the local school board and superintendent to let me teach a curriculum that doesn't hurt kids.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940]   But they had other fish to fry.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.540]   So I'm going to quit, I think.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.180]   I've come slowly to understand what it is I really teach.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:12.200]   A curriculum of confusion, class position, arbitrary justice, vulgarity, rudeness, disrespect for privacy, indifference to quality, and utter dependency.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.340]   I teach how to fit into a world I don't want to live in.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.000]   I just can't do it anymore.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.400]   I can't train children to wait to be told what to do.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.980]   I can't train people to drop what they're doing when a bell sounds.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.480]   I can't persuade children to feel some justice in their class placement when there isn't any.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.160]   And I can't persuade children to believe teachers have valuable secrets they can acquire by becoming our disciples.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.660]   That isn't true.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.260]   Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:54.500]   It kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.140]   An exaggeration?
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.240]   Hardly.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.140]   Parents aren't meant to participate in our form of schooling.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.840]   Rhetoric to the contrary.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:12.420]   My orders as school teacher are to make children fit an animal training system, not to help each find his or her personal path.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.900]   The whole blueprint of school procedure is Egyptian, not Greek or Roman.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.500]   It grows from the faith that human value is a scarce thing, represented symbolically by the narrow peak of a pyramid.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.980]   That idea passed into American history through the Puritans.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:40.140]   It found its scientific presentation in the bell curve, along which talent supposedly apportions itself by some iron law of biology.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.780]   It's a religious idea.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.980]   And school is its church.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.180]   New York City hires me to be a priest.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.820]   I offer rituals to keep heresy at bay.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.380]   I provide documentation to justify the heavenly pyramid.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.380]   Socrates foresaw that if teaching became a formal profession, something like this would happen.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.340]   Professional interest is best served by making what is easy to do seem hard, by subordinating laity to priesthood.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:24.060]   School has become too vital a jobs project, contract giver, and protector of the social order to allow itself to be reformed.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.660]   It has political allies to guard its marches.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.580]   That's why reforms come and go without changing much.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.300]   Even reformers can't imagine school much different.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.940]   David learns to read at age four.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.260]   Rachel at age nine.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.500]   In normal development, when both are 13, you can't tell which one learned first.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.460]   The five-year spread means nothing at all.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.340]   But in school, I will label Rachel "learning disabled" and slow David down a bit, too.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.100]   For a paycheck, I adjust David to depend on me to tell him when to go and stop.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.780]   He won't outgrow that dependency.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.820]   I identify Rachel as discount merchandise, special education.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.340]   After a few months, she'll be locked into her place forever.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.220]   In 26 years of teaching rich kids and poor, I almost never met a learning disabled child.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.620]   Hardly ever met a gifted and talented one either.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.500]   Like all school categories, these are sacred myths created by the human imagination.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.300]   They derive from questionable values we never examine because they preserve the temple of schooling.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.740]   That's the secret behind short answer tests, bells, uniform time blocks, age grading, standardization,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.500]   and all the rest of the school religion punishing our nation.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.260]   There isn't a right way to become educated.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260]   There are as many ways as fingerprints.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.620]   We don't need state-certified teachers to make education happen.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.740]   That probably guarantees it won't.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.380]   How much more evidence is necessary?
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.020]   Good schools don't need more money or a longer year.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.860]   They need real free market choices, variety that speaks to every need and runs risks.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.820]   We don't need a national curriculum or national testing either.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.460]   Both initiatives arise from ignorance of how people learn.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.380]   Or deliberate indifference to it.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.300]   I can't teach this way any longer.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.540]   If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.900]   Come fall, I'll be looking for work, I think.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.940]   The article you've just read was published in the Wall Street Journal July 25, 1991 by
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.180]   John Taylor Gatto, New York State Teacher of the Year.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.260]   I've just learned the last couple days when I pulled up the Foundation for Economic Education
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.060]   website I learned that John Taylor Gatto passed away this past week on October 28.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.260]   Gatto was somebody who was important and influential in my life because as I was wrestling with
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.580]   trying to fit in an analysis of some of the things that I would see in the world, I came
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.140]   across some of his writings.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.580]   Specifically, I came across his book called The Underground History of American Education.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.500]   I proceeded to listen to a number of his talks and found him to be so informed on the subject
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.060]   that he helped a number of pieces to fall into place in my own thinking.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.580]   And it's one of those things that long-time listeners will recognize as a consistent theme
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.100]   in my own opinions and in my own work.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:52.140]   I seek to persuade people to withdraw their children from government schools and to focus
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:58.680]   on their children as individuals and seek to help their children to become truly well-educated
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:06.580]   and competent adults rather than credentialed members of the masses.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.940]   One of the common questions that I receive from listeners when I address subjects, especially
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.940]   inflammatory subjects such as schooling, is to say, "What does this have to do with finances?"
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.900]   Well, as a long-time financial planner, I've learned that parents will spend almost any
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.980]   amount of money on their children's college, and they'll spend almost any amount of money,
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.380]   if they have it, on their children's private schooling.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:39.080]   But very rarely will a parent sit down and read a book about education or think critically
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.740]   about their own educational journey.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.780]   Very rarely will a parent disattach themselves from the norms of society enough to look at
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:53.420]   their own children and say, "How can I spend our money to enable my child's education in
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.700]   the way that's best for my child?"
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.740]   And it's for this reason that I feel justified in beating this bell because parents are rightly
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:09.780]   concerned about their children's educational outcomes, and parents are right to dedicate
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.740]   their money toward this end.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.400]   And yet, many parents don't even know where to start, and they waste hundreds of thousands
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:28.260]   of dollars on credentialization in the mainstream school system that doesn't serve their child
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.260]   well.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.540]   Now, I'm grateful to see that many things have been changing in the past years.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.620]   I see more and more parents who are willing to slow down to read a book and to study and
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.620]   to think.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.820]   I see more and more parents who are willing to change their life and lifestyle to meet
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.260]   the needs of their children.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:53.800]   That's my hope that by sharing these ideas with you, I can help you to more effectively
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.300]   invest the money in your child's education.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.980]   Because the most effective investments are not my telling you which funds to put into
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:14.660]   your 529 plan or which state's 529 plan to participate in.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.020]   But my best way to actually get to the root of the matter is to help you rethink the whole
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.260]   idea of a 529 plan.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.400]   The problem is this.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.980]   As a parent, you feel tremendous pressure to go along with your peers.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.900]   You feel tremendous pressure to go along with what's normal.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.460]   You feel tremendous pressure to fit in.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:48.100]   And so in order for you to go against that and to make unique individual decisions for
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.980]   your life and for your family, you will need a huge amount of self-confidence.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:04.000]   You will probably need to do a significant amount of research and you will need confidence
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.100]   that's wrought from education for you to go in a different direction.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:16.380]   As no doubt you can hear, I continue to experience a weakness in my voice and so I'm not operating
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.300]   at 100%.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.900]   And so this week I'm going to just release a couple of audio files for you from John
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.260]   Taylor Gatto.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.700]   I'm going to release this file that you'll hear.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:36.020]   I also intend to release a relatively short one hour lecture that he delivered called
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.860]   A Short Angry History of American Education.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:43.580]   It will save you a reading of several hundred pages and give you kind of an overview.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.140]   I also intend to release to you a fairly lengthy file which was recorded by Richard Grove
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.940]   back in 2011 before Gatto suffered a stroke called The Ultimate History Lesson.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.460]   Now depending on your learning style you may find those files very dense.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.700]   Gatto is not a linear presenter.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:07.020]   He's more of, I'm not sure the word to use, but it doesn't go bing bing bing bing bing
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.940]   from one point clearly to the next.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.620]   So it's one of those things where you need some familiarity with the concepts to follow
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.700]   the threads.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.300]   But I'll release it to you here in an audio form in case you, in hopes that it will serve
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   you.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.020]   That at least you can listen to the content and you can go from there and follow the resources
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   out if you want.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.720]   I'd like to read you Gatto's obituary that was published in the, again, the Foundation
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.100]   for Economic Education because I think it gives the uninitiated a good insight into
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.940]   who he was.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.740]   John Taylor Gatto, 1935 to 2018.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.300]   Remembering America's Most Courageous Teacher.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.660]   Gatto leaves behind a legacy that inspired thousands of people to challenge the premise
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.260]   on which our education system was built.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.620]   This obituary is by Brittany Hunter.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.940]   It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the passing of a revolutionary educator, John
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.580]   Taylor Gatto.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.720]   Gatto spent nearly 30 years as a teacher in the infamously rough New York City public
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.260]   school system.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.300]   He was awarded New York City Teacher of the Year three consecutive years while also being
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.220]   recognized as New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.940]   Over the course of his career, Gatto was recognized by other educators for the rapport he had
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.060]   built with his students.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.140]   While other teachers were spending much of their day on behavioral management issues,
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.620]   Gatto's students were actively engaged in his lectures and genuinely excited about learning.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.940]   When faculty members would come to him seeking advice, his prescription was simple.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.980]   Treat your students the same way you'd treat anyone else.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:49.940]   Above all, Gatto understood that his students were not mere underlings, but individuals
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.220]   with unique skills and talents to share with the rest of the world.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.940]   They didn't want to be talked down to, but longed to be treated with respect and dignity.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.420]   He recognized that their worth was not determined by the neighborhoods where they lived, their
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.780]   parents' annual salaries, or the scores they received on standardized tests.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.380]   He concluded that "genius is as common as dirt.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.820]   We suppress genius because we haven't yet figured out how to manage a population of
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.700]   educated men and women.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.660]   The solution, I think, is simple and glorious.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.860]   Let them manage themselves."
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.700]   After three decades in the classroom, Gatto realized that the public school system was
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.540]   squashing individualism more than it was educating students and preparing them for the real world.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.220]   To make matters worse, his later research would reveal that this dumbing down was not
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.740]   just by accident, but by design.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.980]   Feeling the education system was beyond repair, Gatto could no longer, in good conscience,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.460]   be an active participant.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.700]   Rather than sending his letter of resignation to his superiors in his school district, he
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.420]   sent a copy of "I Quit, I Think" to the Wall Street Journal where it was published
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.700]   as an op-ed on July 25, 1991.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:17.820]   In his biting resignation, he wrote, "I've come slowly to understand what it is I really
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:26.460]   teach—a curriculum of confusion, class position, arbitrary justice, vulgarity, rudeness, disrespect
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.020]   for privacy, indifference to quality, and utter dependency.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.860]   I teach how to fit into a world I don't want to live in.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.500]   I just can't do it anymore.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.340]   I can't train children to wait to be told what to do.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.940]   I can't train people to drop what they're doing when a bell sounds.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.780]   I can't persuade children to feel some justice in their class placement when there isn't
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.780]   any.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.700]   And I can't persuade children to believe teachers have valuable secrets they can acquire
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.820]   by becoming our disciples.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.340]   That isn't true."
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:04.260]   Gatto dedicated the rest of his life to repairing the damage done by the public education system.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.900]   He wrote several books on his experience in the classroom, including "Dumbing Us Down,
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:14.020]   the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling" and "Weapons of Mass Instruction, a School
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.900]   Teacher's Journey Through the Dark World of Compulsory Schooling."
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.460]   His book, "The Underground History of American Education" is perhaps the most accurate and
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.540]   damning history of the American education system that has ever been written.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.180]   Gatto encouraged parents to foster an environment where their children could follow their bliss
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.420]   rather than being stuck in a classroom, trained to be just another cog in the machine.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.700]   He inspired teachers to reassess their reasons for becoming educators and to challenge the
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.340]   status quo.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:49.700]   He was also a firm believer in self-directed education, sometimes referred to as "unschooling."
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.400]   He believed that learning was actually inhibited by the classroom setting and that every single
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.860]   moment of life presented the opportunity to learn and grow.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.620]   He wrote, "Children learn what they live.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.260]   Put kids in a class and they will live out their lives in an invisible cage, isolated
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.140]   from their chance at community.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.460]   Interrupt kids with bells and horns all the time and they will learn that nothing is important
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.580]   or worth finishing.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.740]   Ridicule them and they will retreat from human association.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.380]   Shame them and they will find a hundred ways to get even.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.500]   The habits taught in large-scale organizations are deadly."
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.060]   Author and ardent unschooling advocate, Kerry MacDonald, had this to say of Gatto's legacy
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.240]   in this regard, "John Taylor Gatto's writings inspired a generation of parents and educators
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:44.380]   to question deep-seated beliefs about compulsory mass schooling and pursue alternatives.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.460]   For homeschoolers in particular, Gatto affirmed the vital role of family and empowered parents
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.500]   to take back control of their child's education.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.820]   His words will continue to have a lasting impact on education for years to come."
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.660]   Zach Slaback, who authored "The End of School" and wrote the foreword to Gatto's newest edition
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.940]   of "Dumbing Us Down" also had a few remarks on Gatto's legacy.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.780]   Gatto's writing, teaching, and approach to not just education, but human flourishing
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.660]   in general, inspired me to think critically about my own life and education.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.900]   He's one of the most important thinkers in American history.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.340]   That's becoming more obvious every day.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.660]   He'll be missed dearly.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.900]   Slaback also said he carries a card in his wallet with this John Taylor Gatto quote,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.860]   "You either learn your way towards writing your own script in life, or you become an
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.980]   unwitting actor in somebody else's script."
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.380]   On October 25th, after a long battle with health issues, Gatto departed this world at
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.020]   82 years old.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.820]   He has survived by his loving wife and two children.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.540]   In addition to his family, he leaves behind a legacy that inspired thousands of people
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:57.300]   to challenge the premise on which our education system was built and to protect a child's
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:04.060]   right to a real education built on actual experience rather than government-sanctioned
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.980]   texts.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.100]   So as we honor the life of this great man, I'll leave you with a few of Gatto's most
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.780]   inspirational quotes.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.140]   School is a 12-year jail sentence where bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.460]   I teach school and win awards doing it, I should know.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:30.540]   It is absurd and anti-life to be part of a system that compels you to sit in confinement
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.540]   with people of exactly the same age and social class.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.580]   That system effectively cuts you off from the immense diversity of life and the synergy
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.580]   of variety.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:46.980]   Indeed, it cuts you off from your own past and future, sealing you in a continuous present,
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.300]   much the same way television does.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:57.140]   It is absurd and anti-life to move from cell to cell at the sound of a gong for every day
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.900]   of your natural youth in an institution that allows you no privacy and even follows you
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:08.460]   into the sanctuary of your home, demanding that you do its homework.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.760]   How will they learn to read, you ask?
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.760]   And my answer is, remember the lessons of Massachusetts.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:20.660]   When children are given whole lives instead of age-graded ones in cell blocks, they learn
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:26.180]   to read, write, and do arithmetic with ease, if those things make sense in the kind of
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.300]   life that unfolds around them.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:36.340]   Independent study, community service, adventures and experience, large doses of privacy and
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:42.060]   solitude, a thousand different apprenticeships, the one-day variety or longer, these are all
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.900]   powerful, cheap, and effective ways to start a real reform of schooling.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.420]   But no large-scale reform is ever going to work to repair our damaged children and our
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:20:00.500]   damaged society until we force open the idea of "school" to include "family" as the main
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.660]   engine of education.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:08.220]   If we use schooling to break children away from parents, and make no mistake, that has
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.140]   been the central function of schools since John Cotton announced it as the purpose of
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.900]   the Bay Colony schools in 1650, and Horace Mann announced it as the purpose of Massachusetts
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:27.140]   school in 1850, we're going to continue to have the horror show we have right now.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.900]   Whatever an education is, it should make you a unique individual, not a conformist.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.760]   It should furnish you with an original spirit with which to tackle the big challenges.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.260]   It should allow you to find values which will be your roadmap through life.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:48.020]   It should make you spiritually rich, a person who loves whatever you are doing, wherever
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.820]   you are, whomever you are with.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:56.740]   It should teach you what is important, how to live, and how to die.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:03.260]   I want to close today's show with reading to you a short excerpt from one of John's
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:10.100]   talks where he discusses the purpose of schooling.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:18.220]   This talk has been reworked into a fairly popular YouTube video, but the creators of
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:24.300]   the video put a bunch of music underneath it, and I couldn't find, I didn't find it
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.900]   to add much, and I couldn't find a recording of it without the music.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.780]   And so I've decided just simply to read to you the transcript.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:41.420]   So again in closing, this is John Taylor Gatto speaking on the purpose of schooling.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:46.500]   School was intended on this continent to be as it had been in northern Germany, a fifth
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   column into the burgeoning libertarian condition where disenfranchised and oppressed groups
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.540]   were clamoring for some kind of seat at the bargaining table.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.300]   School was to be a surgical incision into which the class-based management theories
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.460]   of England were to be inserted to interdict the liberty traditions.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.180]   England's multi-layered social class is simply a modern-day representation of Julius Caesar's
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.860]   advice that when you are overwhelmed by the enemy, you divide them and conquer them that
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.080]   way by setting them against each other.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.700]   The method was to be by infiltration into the minds of children out of sight of their
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.340]   parents.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.900]   The well-read here won't be shocked.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:36.900]   Theorists from Plato to Rousseau to Frederick of Prussia knew and taught explicitly that
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.860]   if children could be kept childish beyond its term in nature, if they could be cloistered
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:50.260]   in a society of children without any real responsibility except obedience, if their
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:57.540]   inner lives could be attenuated by removing the insights of history, literature, philosophy,
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:03.380]   economics, religion, if the imminence of death and the certainty of pain and loss could be
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:10.400]   removed from daily consciousness, if the profound reflections on one's own death could be replaced
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:18.420]   by the trivializing emotions of greed, envy, jealousy, and fear, young people would grow
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:25.660]   older but they would never grow up, and a great enduring problem of supervision would
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.100]   be solved.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:35.660]   For who can argue against the truth that childish and childlike people are much easier to manage
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.260]   than critically trained, self-reliant ones?
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:46.220]   Now you are ready to hear the six purposes of modern schooling taken directly from Dr.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.500]   Anglis' book.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.420]   The first function of schooling is "adjustive."
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.220]   Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.320]   It is fixed habits of reaction.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.920]   Notice that this precludes critical judgment completely.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:15.300]   Notice too that requiring obedience to stupid orders is a much better test of function 1
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.060]   than following sensible orders ever could be.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:24.740]   You don't know whether people are reflexively obedient unless they will march right off
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.100]   the cliff.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.080]   Second is the "diagnostic" function.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:38.620]   Each school is to determine each student's proper social role, logging the evidence mathematically
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.740]   and anecdotally on cumulative records.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.900]   You probably thought that the kid or a parent or neighbors, the region or circumstances.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   No.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:55.540]   The school is to determine your proper social role, and they are to fix you in that role
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.900]   mathematically on their cumulative records.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.580]   Next comes the "sorting" function.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:10.740]   School sorts children by training individuals only so far as their likely destination in
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.060]   the social machine, not one step beyond.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.260]   Keep in mind, you're not listening to John Gatto.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:23.900]   You're listening to the man for whom the Honor Lecture in Education at Harvard is named.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.560]   The fourth function is "conformity."
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.060]   As much as possible, kids are to be made alike.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:34.140]   Whatever the background they come from, they are to be made alike.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:40.700]   This is not done from any passion for egalitarian ideals, but so that their future behavior
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:49.320]   will be mathematically predictable in service to market research and government research.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.520]   Next comes the "hygienic" function.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.880]   This one is my favorite.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.020]   This has nothing to do with individual health, but it has a lot to do with the health of
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.280]   the race.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.100]   At least as Anglis or Darwin or his first cousin, Galton, saw it.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:10.380]   Hygiene is a polite way of saying that school is expected to accelerate natural selection
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:16.420]   by tagging the unfit so clearly by humiliation—that's what all those humiliations from first grade
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:24.460]   on rankings are all about—so clearly that the unfit will drop from the reproduction
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.740]   sweepstakes, either in despair or because their likely mates will have accepted the
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.740]   school's judgment of them as terminally inferior.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.820]   And last comes a fancy Latin word, the "propaedutic" function.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.780]   That's fancy word meaning that a small fraction of lucky kids will quietly be taught how to
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.660]   take over management of this continuing project.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:54.360]   Guardians of a population deliberately dumbed down and rendered childlike in order that
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.500]   government and economic life can be managed with a minimum of hassle.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:05.700]   It's that low-down nitty-gritty common purpose—not Marxist grand warfare between
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.420]   classes and greedy captains of industry.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:15.960]   It's simply so that management will have a minimum of hassles.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.140]   With Kroger Brand products from Ralphs, you can make all your favorite things this holiday
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:25.840]   season because Kroger Brand's proven quality products come at exceptionally low prices.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:33.980]   And with a money-back quality guarantee, every dish is sure to be a favorite.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:40.660]   Whether you shop delivery, pickup, or in-store, Kroger Brand has all your favorite things.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.660]   Ralphs, fresh for everyone.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.420]   (dramatic music)
