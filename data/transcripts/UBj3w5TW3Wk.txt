[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   So before we get started, I just wanted to tell you, like, I, one of the reasons that
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.280]   I wanted you on here is because I admire you so much and like, just the way you live your
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.580]   life and everything, it just, like, I love you so much.
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.440]   I tell people all the time, like, if there was one person I could have them meet, it'd
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.920]   be you, like, and I love you and so I'm happy that you're here.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.800]   The first thing that I wanted to ask you about was about joy, like, it's something I feel
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.840]   like you purposely live with and you are always joyful, I've never been around you when you're
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.800]   not bringing joy and good energy into a room, so I just wanted to ask you about that and
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.200]   like, how did that become such a, like, a natural part of you?
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.400]   I can remember, and this is, it's not my original, but I read someplace, or my, I guess it was
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.360]   my daughter-in-law sent me a medal and it had, at the top they had Jesus, and in the
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.040]   middle they had a group of people, and then at the bottom it had one person, and it spelled
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.440]   out joy, Jesus first, everybody else second, others, J-O, and why put yourself last, and
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.120]   that is, in all my years of experience, that's the joy and that's the recipe for joy.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.720]   Yeah, no, that's amazing, it's so crazy to me because it's like, in our culture nowadays,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.000]   the world teaches that the recipe for happiness, and happiness and joy are different, and I'll
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.600]   get into that in a second, but they teach if you want to be happy that you just have
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.080]   to, like, search for your own happiness and do what makes you happy, and it's, and I think
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.680]   people sometimes follow that, and then they realize, like, when they're only thinking
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   about themselves, then it's impossible to find happiness, but when you can, like you
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.040]   said, think about Jesus first, and then others, and then yourself last, that's the real, that's
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.760]   the real recipe for joy, but I think it's so opposite of what the world teaches nowadays,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.160]   you know what I mean?
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.440]   For sure, especially the younger generations, for sure.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.840]   So, another thing that I wanted to ask you about is, like, just your simplicity with
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   life, like, ever since I've known you, obviously, you've been in this house a long time and
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.080]   everything, but you've been here in the same house, you haven't really bought a ton
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   of new things, you just got an iPhone, and now I can text you, but, like, how did you
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.480]   adapt kind of that simplistic view to life, and how do material possessions, like, not
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.840]   mean much to you, or at least it seemed from the outside like they don't?
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.640]   All right, my motto is, and I have a sign downstairs, is live simply, and I look at
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.480]   it all the time, but I never, and you know what, Michael?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.760]   I don't feel like, I mean, I feel like I have so much.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:10.080]   I mean, I have a home, I have financial security, I can buy groceries, and I have running shoes,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   I have gym equipment, I have, I don't need much, and I just never have, but I have so
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   much more than I have had as a child.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.080]   I mean, as a child, we didn't have that much, and I feel that to be able to pay your bills
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.520]   is huge, to have electricity and air conditioning, there's, honestly, truly, I don't think I
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.240]   ever go grocery shopping without saying, "Thank you, Lord, for the money," because I know
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   I'm managing His money, and I pray that I use it the right way, and here's something,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.880]   and you've heard it before, I think God makes us all where there's a piece of puzzle that
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.760]   only God can fulfill, and if you try to put possessions in there, and if you try to put
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.360]   any relationships, anything in that piece that is God, because He made us to be in His
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.100]   image and to be His child, you'll never be completely joyful.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.360]   First you feel that part, and then everything else falls into place.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.880]   Yeah, and my experience, you know, being in the NBA, having, you know, some money now,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.960]   and being around all these people with money, it's like, all these guys, and it just gets,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.400]   you get caught up in a cycle, but they think, "Oh, the next car that I get, the next, you
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.160]   know, the next house I get, the next piece of jewelry I get, that'll make me happy,"
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.660]   and when you constantly get in that cycle, it's like, and you constantly are getting
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.480]   these new things, and you realize that that isn't gonna make you happy, then a lot of
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.120]   guys end up depressed, and that's why I think, you know, some of the most famous people,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.340]   some of the people that have the most money and the most material possessions, they end
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.360]   up the least happy, because their whole life, they thought that these possessions would
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.480]   make them happy, and that was their whole goal, was to get famous and get money and
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.040]   buy all these things, and now they're not happy, and even for me, like, we kind of grew
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.920]   up where we didn't have a lot of money, but my mom and dad made it seem like we had everything
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.640]   we needed, and we were so happy, and even me, you know, being in the NBA now, and having
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.360]   money, like, I can even get caught up in just thinking that buying stuff will make me happy,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.960]   but you, I mean, it's just so crazy, because people don't learn from, like, celebrities
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.560]   or famous athletes or whatever, they don't learn from their mistakes, and they don't
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.320]   see that these people that can get anything sometimes are the most unhappy people, you
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.240]   know what I mean, and it's really sad.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.400]   - People who have lots of things that, I mean, they're not the ones I wanna be like, but
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   those who live a more simple life and do it the right way, God's way, they're the ones
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:02.240]   I think, wow, they're my icons, but I do understand what you're saying about the people that you
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.720]   are with it, they have that mindset, it's easy to go that way.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.360]   - Yeah, I've had to honestly struggle, like, with that at times, just in my free time,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.040]   who do I hang out with, who do I spend time with, because it's something that when you're
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.880]   around that all the time, you can kind of get, you can kind of start to, like, mold
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.120]   into that in a way if you're not really, really careful, and for me, I've just had to be really
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.700]   careful about that and just make sure that my free time, I'm spending time around people
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:37.200]   who see it like you and see it and are so joyful, but it's like, it's not because of
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.080]   the things they have, and I mean, you see it even, like, overseas, like, America is
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.040]   so spoiled compared to most countries, but then you go overseas and you see these kids
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.520]   who have nothing, but they're running around with their shirts off all day, and they look
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.760]   like they're having the most fun ever, I mean, Sierra tells me stories all the time about
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.360]   how she goes to these different places and spends time with these kids and they're just
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   so joyful.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   - That's beautiful.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360]   - You know what I mean?
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360]   - That's so beautiful.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   - Yeah.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   - Yeah.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   We get caught up in the world, but it's easy not to get caught up in the world 'cause most
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.440]   of my friends are very similar in their mindset.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.000]   They're financially okay 'cause they can take care of their bills, but we know, but life
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.280]   experience teaches you, it's not things, it's relationships with the Lord and with your
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   family.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.340]   - Do you think that that came with time for you, like, did you ever struggle with wanting
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.720]   stuff and thinking stuff would make you happy, or did you realize that at a really young
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   age?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.760]   'Cause I feel like a lot of people, it's kind of trial and error, like, they try to get
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.360]   all these things, but then they finally realize, "Oh, this stuff isn't gonna make me happy.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.320]   I need to turn somewhere else for happiness."
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.720]   And sometimes that leads people to Jesus, sometimes it doesn't, but for you, what was
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.720]   it like?
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.440]   - Okay, honestly, truly, I'm thinking it went right back to when I was a kid.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.040]   We always had shelter, we always had food, and we always had parents that loved us and
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   a grandma upstairs that loved us.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:17.220]   I just never, all I remember, bill collectors coming to get money at home and they would
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.680]   send me to the door and say, "My dad's not home," even if he was home, 'cause they didn't
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.360]   have the money.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.200]   I think I was probably seven when I said to myself, "Self, I will never have to send a
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.840]   bill collector away.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.120]   I will be careful, frugal.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.880]   I don't want a lot of money, but I do appreciate money to take care of my needs."
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:49.240]   I became a teacher and because I wanted to be a teacher, not about money, I married Fred.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.180]   He was just getting out of the service and I married him, not because of money, but because
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.860]   he loved the Lord and I wanted him for the father of my children.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.120]   But I did know that before we got married, he had to have a job 'cause I did not want
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.920]   to repeat not having stability, 'cause that's really important to me.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   I'm just being smart with what you do have and I know, if we run out of food on Sunday,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.120]   I don't go shopping 'til Tuesday, then we do without and I think it's good to do without.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.440]   I love to be without something and just say, "Oh yeah, tomorrow we're gonna get peanut
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.640]   butter," and not that I couldn't go any day and get more, but I like doing without.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.360]   I think it's good for me.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.120]   I've always said, and this might be really weird of me to say, but I've always said,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.000]   "I want to spend at least some part of my life where I'm living off of barely any money
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.960]   and I'm experiencing what ... I've always wanted to try that."
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.600]   I'm not saying live on the street and be homeless, but close to it, I want to live off a tiny
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.880]   bit of money to see what it was like and just really experiencing that for myself, 'cause
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.600]   especially in Denver, you see all these homeless people and I just have always wondered what
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.960]   it felt like to, like I said, not live homeless, but live with a very little amount of means.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   So I might try that.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.040]   It probably obviously wouldn't be sometime when I'm in the league, but it might be after.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.920]   That would be a great challenge.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:35.380]   Go someplace and live on, let's say, just live on $3,000 a month, and that's a lot.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.240]   The homeless people don't have that.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.580]   But where you had to say, "No, I've already ... No, can't have that one, nope."
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.640]   I love living that way.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.320]   I love not wasting money.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   I can give money away, but I cannot waste it.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   Right.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   I'm kind of the same way, 'cause I think a lot of people also who did grow up with nothing,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.040]   but now at least being around some of the guys I'm around who now have all this money,
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.920]   they get so used to having money.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.060]   It takes a while when you first get into the NBA or whatever, and then you first get that
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.600]   money, it's a shock, and you're kind of like so grateful, but after a while, you see guys
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   just get so used to that lifestyle that now they're not even grateful anymore.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.640]   I think that if you ... That's kind of why I want to do it in a way.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.880]   If you were to go away from that lifestyle for a little bit and then come back and have
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.400]   money and stuff, you'd just be grateful all over again.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.680]   I think being grateful is one of the top ways you can be happy.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.360]   I think so too.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   I think so too.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   A joyful heart.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   And then everything seems fine.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:49.440]   Even in bad times, if you're thankful, it turns it around, 'cause that's a great prayer
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   right there.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.640]   I was watching a sermon actually about that the other day, and it just talked about when
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.400]   you are going through bad times, being grateful ... You don't have to try to will yourself
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.680]   to be grateful, but if you just say thank you to God and to other people for everything
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   that you are thankful for, that's a remedy for joy when you are ... 'Cause no one can
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.280]   be happy all the time, but when you are down and you think like that and you just say thank
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.880]   you, I feel like that can get you out of that entitled attitude.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.320]   Right where you're sitting, usually I have my gratitude journal, and I keep a running
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:33.160]   thank you, Lord, and when you leave, I will put your name in there and Sarah's name because
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.040]   I love counting my blessings.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:43.480]   I heard another explanation, 'cause it's hard to be thankful for when you get a bad diagnosis
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   or something's happening with one of your kids.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.840]   And it said something about we give thanks in all things.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.560]   Well, we can give thanks because the Lord's gonna go through it with us, and sometimes
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   that's what you say, "Lord, I don't understand it, but thank you that you're gonna go through
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   it."
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   And there's your thankful gratitude heart.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   Talk about that a little bit.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.400]   Like when you were going through your cancer and chemo and stuff, how in the world ... 'Cause
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.480]   whenever I talk to you on the phone, you seem so fine.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.360]   How did you keep that just upbeat attitude, and I know inside you probably weren't experiencing
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.880]   happiness all the time, but how did you keep that gratefulness and that joy and continue
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.840]   to talk to God through it and all that?
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.640]   How did you keep that mentality?
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.280]   Well, number one, I think you might have heard from your parents.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:45.560]   This third time, I finished my third time, and I just signed people up to be on my Positive
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.080]   Energy Bus.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   There's a book called The Positive Energy Bus.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   You need to read it.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   It is so powerful.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.640]   So this time I took people along on my journey, and they were powerful prayer people.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.800]   And so instead of being sad for me, they would say ... When they got kind of sad, I went,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.520]   "Thank you for being in my positive."
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.740]   Then it turned their frame of mind around to be positive.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.440]   So surround yourself with positive people, prayer.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.400]   I look back, Michael, 2011 when it started, I can hardly remember it.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.280]   You know that footprints in the sand where Jesus picks you up and you only see one footprint?
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.160]   He's carried me through all my hardships.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.480]   I mean, you look back and you go, "Well, that wasn't bad because He carries you."
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.400]   I can promise you that's true.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.080]   I don't know if I have to go through it again because it's one that keeps coming back, but
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   I do know I'm going to hire all my people on my Positive Energy Bus, and I know I've
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.680]   got all your signatures.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.600]   And I have hundreds of people that when they need something, I'm on their bus.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:05.400]   I just love going through life together with people, and as you know, there are hard times,
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.760]   but when I look back, it doesn't seem that hard, but I don't want to have to do it again.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.800]   But if I have to do it again, I'll hire people on my Positive Energy Bus.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.560]   Yeah, if anybody can ...
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.440]   I remember you came to see me one time.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   I remember that, too.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.440]   I think we played cards.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.640]   Yeah, that's crazy to me.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.080]   I think, so you would rather have people when you're going through tough stuff just bring
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.480]   positivity and like ... Because sometimes, I think, some people are looking for people
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:41.720]   to kind of like console them and like empathize with them in kind of a sad way when they're
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.760]   going through sad things, but you would rather just have a bunch of people that are just
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.560]   lifting you up positively throughout the whole process.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   Well, I mean, because if they're my friends, you know that they're sad that it's going
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.000]   through, but they also know it gives me strength if they go, "Okay, we can do it," instead
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   of going, "Oh, honey, I don't want you to go through it," and then that makes me go,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.200]   "But I have to, so let's do it."
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.240]   And here's another thing, Michael, and I pray I can always, because I don't know what's
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   ahead.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:17.200]   And times might get really hard with stuff, but I just believe in not wasting a day.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:24.120]   I mean, if every day ... There's a week after a chemo that I just kind of wasn't ... I had
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.800]   to go running every day because I had to fight it kind of, but probably I ran in ... The
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   house has never changed.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.200]   I think I was going that slow, but I determined to keep exercising and to do everything in
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   my power to keep strong because every day is so powerful.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.380]   I don't want to waste a day because even through this COVID stuff, you know, I have been walking
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.880]   with friends socially distance.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:56.360]   I've been doing outdoor things because I think every day is such a gift, and I don't want
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   to lose that day.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   Right.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   No, that's a big time.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.440]   So I want to talk about your planks first.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   Okay, I already did.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   I hope you're not going to ask me to do it.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.160]   I thought, "I'm going to do it before he gets here, he's going to ask me."
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.160]   Yes, Michael.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   On my planks.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   Are you still doing them every day?
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   Absolutely.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.600]   I will get out of bed at night if I forgot.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   Two and a half minutes.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.400]   Two and a half minute plank every day.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.880]   How many days straight do you think it's been?
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   Four years.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   Four years.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.440]   If I ever missed any, it would be probably on a trip.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.360]   I couldn't find a spot in a hotel where I was in bed and I didn't remember if I didn't
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.760]   remember it, but I probably would double it up the next day because I'm just determined.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.240]   And don't ask me why, but it's ... I love ... You're on my planking chart.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   Yeah, I did.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.360]   But two and a half minutes was so hard for me when we did it over at my house.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   That was so hard.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.360]   Your mom did four.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.360]   You made it look so easy.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.680]   Well, no, but I have a smaller body.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.040]   Still, I'm a professional athlete and you ...
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.320]   Okay, but you know what?
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   It never gets easier.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920]   Really?
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.720]   So I do it right here and I'll go, "Alexa, set the timer for two and a half minutes."
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.960]   And then I take my devotional.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.400]   Fred will sit here and I'll do my devotional, and then he'll look up the scripture.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.600]   And then I'll go, "Alexa, how many minutes left?"
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.720]   And then when it goes off, I go, "All right."
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.840]   Wait, so Fred doesn't do it with you?
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.860]   Fred is not one bit interested in planks.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.860]   Who is?
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   So who do you jog with then?
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.520]   Who do you do that with?
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.880]   Actually ... Okay, so tell me something.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.600]   What game did you play at Thanksgiving with your family?
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   We played ... It's called "Doo-Doo and Your Neighbor."
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.040]   Okay, I grew up on that one.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   You know how to play it?
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   It's like whoever has a ...
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   It was your mom's favorite game.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   We played it when we were kids.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   Yeah, it's so fun.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.360]   But Brie won, so we all played with $15, so she won a $150.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.720]   Okay, now stop it on the $15.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   We played for three nickels.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   I could not do a dollar.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.260]   My daughter wanted to do the $15.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.920]   So we did like three chips.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.560]   Each chip meant $5, so Brie ...
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.000]   But did people have their own money or ...
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Yeah, everybody had their own.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.520]   Because half the time when they come to my house, I have to give them their nickels.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.240]   Yeah, everybody had their own money.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.200]   Okay, here's a wonderful family.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.320]   Look at how they decorate.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   Whoa.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.760]   And here ... Okay, over here, I wish he was out.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.600]   He's a fireman, and he trains rescue dogs.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   Really?
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   He's a really nice guy.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.520]   So you know all these people pretty good?
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.160]   Well, since COVID, I've been working this neighborhood.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.760]   I don't know all, but if they were out, I would say, "Hey, what's your name?
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.440]   What's your first name?"
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.280]   Yeah, because honestly, truly, Michael, I pray for these neighbors every single day.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.280]   All of them?
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   Yep.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.440]   I don't know them all, but I have gotten more.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   Come on.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Come on.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440]   Come on.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   I got tired.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   Oh, you did not.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   Yeah, I did.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   You don't get tired.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   You're athletic.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   Nice and easy.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   I'm not fast, but I could go forever.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   How long could you go?
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   Well, my furthest is 13 miles, a half marathon, but now, I just do three Ks, and when people
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   pass me, I'll go, "Way to go."
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   Who's this guy?
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   I don't know.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   I'm sure he's nice.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   I know his wife.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   Oh, really?
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   Oh, really?
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:44.080]   seeing him in the neighborhood.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   I haven't seen this.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   He lives over there.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   He's a professor, I believe.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   What's up, man?
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   Hey, good morning.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.080]   I want to talk about Fred.
