[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.640]   So before we get started, I just wanted to tell you,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.680]   like one of the reasons that I wanted you on here is because I admire you so much.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.600]   And just the way you live your life and everything, I love you so much.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.280]   I tell people all the time, if there was one person I could have them meet,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.120]   it'd be you, and I love you, and so I'm happy that you're here.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.080]   The first thing that I wanted to ask you about was about joy.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.800]   It's something I feel like you purposely live with, and you are always joyful.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.440]   I've never been around you when you're not bringing joy and
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200]   good energy into a room.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.560]   So I just wanted to ask you about that, and
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280]   how did that become such a natural part of you?
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.880]   >> I can remember, and it's not my original, but I read someplace.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.480]   I guess it was my daughter-in-law sent me a medal, and
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.080]   at the top, they had Jesus, and in the middle, they had a group of people.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.600]   And then at the bottom, it had one person, and it spelled out joy,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.040]   Jesus first, everybody else second, others, J-O, and why put yourself last.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.480]   And that is, in all my years of experience, that's the joy and
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.560]   that's the recipe for joy.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.080]   >> Yeah, now that's amazing.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.160]   It's so crazy to me because it's like, in our culture nowadays,
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.200]   the world teaches that the recipe for happiness, and happiness and
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960]   joy are different, and I'll get into that in a second.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   But they teach, if you wanna be happy, that you just have to search for
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.000]   your own happiness and do what makes you happy.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.440]   And I think people sometimes follow that, and then they realize when they're only
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.360]   thinking about themselves, then it's impossible to find happiness.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.600]   But when you can, like you said, think about Jesus first, and then others, and
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.640]   then yourself last, that's the real recipe for joy.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   But I think it's so opposite of what the world teaches nowadays.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   >> For sure, especially the younger generations.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.480]   >> Yeah. >> For sure.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.120]   >> So another thing that I wanted to ask you about is just your simplicity with life.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.560]   Ever since I've known you, obviously, you've been in this house a long time and
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.720]   everything, but you've been here in the same house,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.240]   you haven't really bought a ton of new things.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.440]   You just got an iPhone.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.560]   >> I hand me down.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.640]   >> And now I can text you, but how did you adapt that simplistic view to life?
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.800]   And how do material possessions not mean much to you?
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.160]   Or at least they seem from the outside like they don't.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.800]   >> All right, my motto is, and I have a sign downstairs, is live simply.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.360]   And I look at it all the time.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.560]   But I never, and you know what, Michael?
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.800]   I don't feel like, I mean, I feel like I have so much.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.720]   I mean, I have a home, I have financial security,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.120]   I can buy groceries, and I have running shoes.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.040]   I have gym equipment, I have, I don't need much.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   And I just never have, but I have so much more than I have had as a child.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.520]   I mean, as a child, we didn't have that much.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.760]   And I feel that to be able to pay your bills is huge.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.600]   To have electricity and air conditioning, there's honestly, truly,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.920]   I don't think I ever go grocery shopping without saying thank you, Lord, for
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   the money.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.240]   Cuz I know I'm managing his money, and I pray that I use it the right way.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.640]   And here's something, and you've heard it before.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.880]   I think God makes us all where there's a piece of puzzle that only God can fulfill.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.080]   And if you try to put possessions in there, if you try to put any relationships,
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.000]   anything in that piece that is God, cuz he made us to be in his image and
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.900]   to be his child, you'll never be completely joyful.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.560]   First you feel that part, and then everything else falls into place.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   >> Yeah, in my experience, being in the NBA, having some money now,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.400]   and being around all these people with money, it's like all these guys.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.800]   And you get caught up in a cycle, but they think, the next car that I get,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.080]   the next house I get, the next piece of jewelry I get, that'll make me happy.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.040]   And when you constantly get in that cycle, it's like, and
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.840]   you constantly are getting these new things.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.040]   And you realize that that isn't gonna make you happy,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.680]   then a lot of guys end up depressed.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.960]   And that's why I think some of the most famous people,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.080]   some of the people that have the most money and the most material possessions,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.200]   they end up the least happy.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.560]   Because their whole life,
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.120]   they thought that these possessions would make them happy.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.560]   And that was their whole goal, was to get famous and get money and
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.160]   buy all these things, and now they're not happy.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.120]   And even for me, we kinda grew up where we didn't have a lot of money, but
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   my mom and dad made it seem like we had everything we needed and we were so happy.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   And even me, being in the NBA now and having money, I can even get caught up in
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.240]   just thinking that buying stuff will make me happy.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.520]   But I mean, it's just so crazy, because people don't learn from celebrities or
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.600]   famous athletes or whatever.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.240]   They don't learn from their mistakes.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.840]   And they don't see that these people that can get anything
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.400]   sometimes are the most unhappy people, you know what I mean?
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.960]   And it's really sad.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.840]   People who have lots of things, I mean, they're not the ones I wanna be like.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.040]   >> But those who live a more simple life and
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.640]   do it the right way, God's way, they're the ones I think, wow, they're my icons.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.120]   But I do understand what you're saying about the people that you are with it,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.360]   they have that mindset, it's easy to go that way.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.480]   >> Yeah, I've had to honestly struggle with that at times, just in my free time.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.640]   Who do I hang out with?
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.560]   Who do I spend time with?
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.640]   Because it's something that when you're around that all the time,
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   you can kinda start to mold into that in a way if you're not really,
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.200]   really careful.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.440]   And for me, I've just had to be really careful about that and
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.640]   just make sure that my free time, I'm spending time around people who see it
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.480]   like you and see it and are so joyful.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.760]   But it's not because of the things they have.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.520]   And I mean, you see it even overseas, America is so spoiled and
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.760]   compared to most countries, but then you go overseas and
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.800]   you see these kids who have nothing.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.280]   But they're running around with their shirts off all day, and
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.360]   they look like they're having the most fun ever.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.960]   I mean, Sierra tells me stories all the time about how she goes to these different
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.480]   places and spends time with these kids, and they're just so joyful.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.200]   >> That's beautiful.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.760]   >> You know what I mean?
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.920]   >> That's so beautiful.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.400]   >> Yeah, we get caught up in the world.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.080]   But it's easy not to get caught up in the world cuz most of my friends
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.320]   are very similar in their mindset.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.360]   They're financially okay cuz they can take care of their bills.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.720]   But we know, but life experience teaches you, it's not things,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.680]   it's relationships with the Lord and with your family.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.720]   >> Do you think that that came with time for you?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.080]   Like, did you ever struggle with wanting stuff and
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.240]   thinking stuff would make you happy?
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.320]   Did you realize that at a really young age?
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.040]   Cuz I feel like a lot of people, it's kind of trial and error.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.920]   They try to get all these things, but then they finally realize,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.600]   this stuff isn't gonna make me happy.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.240]   I need to turn somewhere else for happiness.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.360]   And sometimes that leads people to Jesus, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.600]   But for you, what was it like?
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.360]   >> Okay, honestly, truly, I'm thinking it went right back to when I was a kid.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.280]   We always had shelter, we always had food, and
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.840]   we always had parents that loved us, and a grandma upstairs that loved us.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:15.640]   I just never, all I remember, bill collectors coming to get money at home,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.240]   and they would send me to the door and say my dad's not home,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.200]   even if he was home cuz they didn't have the money.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.160]   I think I was probably seven when I said to myself, self?
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   I will never have to send a bill collector away, I will be careful, frugal.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.920]   I don't want a lot of money, but I do appreciate money to take care of my needs.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.520]   I became a teacher because I wanted to be a teacher, not about money.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.040]   I married Fred, he was just getting out of the service, and
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.440]   I married him, not because of money, but because he loved the Lord and
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.840]   I wanted him for the father of my children.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.600]   But I did know that before we got married, he had to have a job cuz I did not wanna
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.000]   repeat not having stability, cuz that's really important to me.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.440]   I'm just being smart with what you do have.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.400]   And I know, like if we run out of food on Sunday,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.840]   I don't go shopping till Tuesday, then we do without.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.680]   And I think it's good to do without.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.200]   I love to be without something and just say, yeah,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.240]   tomorrow we're gonna get peanut butter.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.280]   And not that I couldn't go any day and get more, but
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.840]   I like doing without, I think it's good for me.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:43.000]   >> Yeah, I've always said, and this might be really weird of me to say,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.720]   but I've always said I wanna spend at least some part of my life
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.640]   where I'm living off of barely any money, and I'm experiencing what-
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> I love it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.880]   >> Like I've always wanted to try that.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.480]   And I'm not saying live on the street and be homeless, but close to it.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.600]   I wanna live off a tiny bit of money to see what it was like, and
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.680]   just really experiencing that for myself, cuz especially in Denver,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.760]   you see all these homeless people.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   And I just have always kinda wondered what it felt like to, like I said,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.880]   not live homeless, but live with a very little amount of means.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.960]   So I might try that.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.200]   It probably obviously wouldn't be some time when I'm in the league, but
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.840]   it might be after, but- >> That would be a great challenge.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:35.320]   Go someplace and live on, let's say, just live on 3,000 a month, and that's a lot.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.840]   The homeless people don't have that.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.760]   >> Yeah. >> But where you had to say no,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.940]   I've already, no, can't have that one, nope.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   >> I love living that way, I love not wasting money.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.780]   I can give money away, but I cannot waste it.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.000]   >> Right. >> Does that make sense?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.240]   >> Right. >> Yeah.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.960]   >> Yeah, I'm kinda the same way.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.040]   Cuz I think a lot of people also who did grow up with nothing, but now,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.000]   at least being around some of the guys I'm around, who now have all this money,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.600]   they get so used to having money.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.000]   It takes a while when you first get into the NBA or whatever, and
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.440]   then you first get that money, it's a shock, and you're kinda so grateful.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.160]   But after a while, you see guys just get so
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.080]   used to that lifestyle that now they're not even grateful anymore.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.000]   And I think that if you, that's kinda why I wanna do it in a way,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.840]   just if you were to go away from that lifestyle for a little bit and
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   then come back and have money and stuff, you'd just be grateful all over again.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.800]   And I think being grateful is one of the top ways you can be happy.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.280]   >> I think so too, [LAUGH] I think so too, a joyful heart.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.440]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah, and then everything seems fine,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.360]   even in bad times, if you're thankful, it turns it around,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.160]   cuz that's a great prayer right there.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.800]   >> Yeah, I was watching a sermon actually about that the other day, and
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   it just talked about when you are going through bad times, being grateful,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.840]   you don't have to try to will yourself to be grateful, but if you just say thank you
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.040]   to God and to other people for everything that you are thankful for,
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.200]   that's a remedy for joy, cuz no one can be happy all the time.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.000]   But when you are down and you think like that, and you just say thank you,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I feel like that can get you out of that entitled attitude.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.420]   >> Yeah, right where you're sitting, usually I have my gratitude journal, and
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.480]   I keep a running thank you, Lord.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   And when you leave, I will put your name in there, and
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.640]   Sierra's name, because I love counting my blessings.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.920]   And I heard another explanation, cuz it's hard to be thankful for
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:47.400]   when you get a bad diagnosis or something's happening with one of your kids.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.240]   And it said something about we give thanks in all things.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.560]   Well, we can give thanks because the Lord's gonna go through it with us.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.400]   And sometimes that's what you say, Lord, I don't understand it, but
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   thank you that you're gonna go through it, and there's your thankful gratitude heart.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.320]   >> Yeah, yeah, talk about that a little bit.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.240]   Like when you were going through your cancer and chemo and stuff,
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.440]   how in the world, cuz whenever I talk to you on the phone, you seem so fine.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.280]   How did you keep that just upbeat attitude?
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.320]   And I know inside you probably weren't experiencing happiness all the time.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.020]   But how did you keep that gratefulness and that joy and
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.840]   continue to talk to God through it and all that?
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.360]   How did you keep that mentality?
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.080]   >> Well, number one, I think you might have heard from your parents.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.240]   I, this third time, this is my third, I finished my third time.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.760]   And I just signed people up to be on my positive energy bus.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   There's a book called The Positive Energy Bus, and you need to read it.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.680]   It is so powerful.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.880]   So I, this time I took people along on my journey.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.160]   And they were powerful prayer people.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.360]   And so instead of being sad for me, they would say, when they got kinda sad,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   I went, thank you for being my positive.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.600]   Then it turned their frame of mind around to be positive.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.520]   So surround yourself with positive people, prayer.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.360]   I look back, Michael, 2011 when it started, I can hardly remember it.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.320]   You know that footprints in the sand where Jesus picks you up and
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.080]   you only see one footprint?
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.200]   He's carried me through all my hardships.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.480]   I mean, you look back and you go, well, that wasn't bad because he carries you.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.560]   I can promise you that's true.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.640]   He, you know, and I don't know if I have to go through it again cuz
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.880]   it's one that keeps coming back.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.600]   But I do know I'm gonna hire my, all my people on my, my positive energy bus.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.280]   And I know I've got all your signatures.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.200]   >> Yeah, I think you put me on it.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.360]   >> Yeah, and I have hundreds of people that, and when they're,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.760]   they need something, I'm on their bus.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.360]   I just love going through life together with people.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.240]   And as you know, there are hard times.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.080]   But when I look back, it doesn't seem that hard.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   But I don't want to have to do it again.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.920]   But if I have to do it again, I'll hire people on my positive energy bus.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.760]   >> Yeah, if anybody can- >> I remember you came to see me one time.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.280]   >> I remember that too.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.600]   >> Yeah, I think we played cards.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.680]   >> Yeah, I, yeah, that's crazy to me.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.120]   I think, so you would rather have people, when you're going through tough stuff,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.520]   just bring positivity and like, cuz sometimes I think some people
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.800]   are looking for people to kind of like console them and like, you know,
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:43.520]   like empathize with them in kind of a sad way when they're going through sad things.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.360]   But you would rather just have a bunch of people that are just lifting you up
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.960]   positively throughout the whole process.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   >> Well, I mean, cuz if they're my friends,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.800]   you know that they're sad that it's going through.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.280]   But they also know it gives me strength if they go, okay, we can do it.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.040]   >> Yeah. >> Instead of going, honey,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.700]   I don't want you to go through it.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.760]   And then that makes me go, but I have to, so let's do it.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.440]   And here's another thing, Michael, and I pray I can always,
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   cuz I don't know what's ahead.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.040]   And times might get really hard with stuff.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.240]   But I just believe in not wasting a day.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:23.840]   I mean, if every day, there's a week after a chemo that I just kinda wasn't,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.680]   I had to go running every day cuz I had to fight it kinda.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.640]   But probably I ran, the house has never changed, I think I was going that slow.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.480]   But I determined to keep exercising and
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.040]   to do everything in my power to keep strong, because every day is so powerful.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.360]   I don't wanna waste a day cuz even through this COVID stuff,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.920]   I have been walking with friends socially distance.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.720]   I've been doing outdoor things because I think every day is such a gift.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.080]   And I don't wanna lose that day.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.480]   >> Right, that's- >> Does that make sense?
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.520]   >> No, that's a big time.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.680]   So I wanna talk about your planks first.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.040]   >> [LAUGH] Okay, I already did, I hope you're not gonna ask me to do it.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.920]   I thought, I'm gonna do it before he gets here, he's gonna ask me.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.680]   Okay, yes, Michael, on my planks.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.080]   >> Are you still doing them every day?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.680]   >> Absolutely, I will get out of bed at night if I forgot.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.720]   >> Two and a half minutes.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.400]   >> Yeah. >> Two and a half minute plank every day.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.760]   >> How many days straight do you think it's been?
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.880]   >> Four years.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   >> Four years.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.560]   >> If I ever missed any, it would be probably on a trip.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.960]   I couldn't find a spot in a hotel where I was in bed if I didn't remember it.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.640]   But I probably would double it up the next day cuz I'm just determined.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.440]   And don't ask me why, but you're on my planking chart.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.000]   >> Yeah, I did, but two and a half minutes- >> See, I was on my planking.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.560]   >> Two and a half minutes was so hard for me when we did it over at my house.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.280]   That was so hard.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.320]   >> Your mom did four.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.640]   >> You made it look so easy.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.520]   >> Well, no, but I have a smaller body.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.200]   >> Still, I'm a professional at this and you- >> Okay, but you know what?
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.120]   It never gets easier.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.480]   >> Really? >> So I do it right here and
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.600]   I'll go, Alexa, set the timer for two and a half minutes.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.800]   And then I take my devotional.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.440]   Fred will sit here and I'll do my devotional and
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.280]   then he'll look up the scripture.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.480]   And then I'll go, Alexa, how many minutes left?
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.720]   And then when it goes off, I go, all right.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.600]   >> Wait, so Fred doesn't do it with you?
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.220]   >> Fred is not one bit interested in who is, I mean, yeah.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.200]   >> So who do you jog with then, who do you jog with?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.880]   >> Actually, okay, so tell me something.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.560]   >> What game did you play at Thanksgiving with your family?
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.400]   >> We played, it's called doo doo on your neighbor.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.960]   >> [LAUGH] >> Okay, I grew up on that one.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.760]   >> You know how to play it?
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.800]   >> My gosh.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.120]   >> It's like whoever has a- >> It was your mom's favorite game.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.200]   We played it when we were kids.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.880]   >> Yeah, no, it's so fun.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.240]   >> Yeah. >> But Bree won, so
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.560]   we all played with $15, so she won a $150.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.960]   >> Okay, now stop it on the $15, we played for three nickels.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.640]   >> [LAUGH] >> I could not do a dollar.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.760]   My daughter wanted to do the $15, I went- >> So we did three chips,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.600]   each chip meant $5, so Bree- >> But
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.520]   did people have their own money or?
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.200]   >> Yeah, everybody had their own.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.920]   >> Cuz half the time when they come to my house, I have to give them their nickels.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.200]   >> Yeah, everybody had their own money.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.720]   >> Okay, here's a wonderful family, look at how they decorate.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.280]   >> Whoa.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.640]   >> And here, okay, over here, I wish he was out.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.800]   He's a fireman and he trains rescue dogs, yeah.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.300]   >> Really?
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.320]   >> Yeah, he's a really nice guy.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.240]   >> So you know all these people pretty good?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   >> Well, since COVID, I've been working this neighborhood.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.880]   [LAUGH] And I don't know all, but if they were out,
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.320]   I would say, hey, what's your name?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.480]   What's your first name?
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.440]   >> Yeah, cuz honestly, truly, Michael, I pray for these neighbors every single day.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.040]   >> All of them?
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.640]   >> Yep, I don't know them all, but I have gotten more, come on.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   >> [LAUGH] >> Come on, come on.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.960]   >> I got tired.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   >> You did not.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.720]   >> Yeah, I did.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.800]   >> You don't get tired.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.520]   >> You're athletic.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.240]   >> Nice and easy, I'm not fast, but I could go forever.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.600]   >> How long could you go?
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.240]   >> Well, my furthest is 13 miles, a half marathon.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:28.160]   But now I just do three Ks, and when people pass me, I'll go, way to go.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.760]   >> Who's this guy?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.800]   >> I don't know, but I'm sure he's nice.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.960]   I know his wife.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.460]   >> Really?
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.000]   >> Yeah, they're going, okay, I haven't seen him in the neighborhood.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.880]   >> I haven't seen this.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.640]   >> Yeah, he lives over there, yeah.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.320]   He's a professor, I believe, yeah.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.120]   >> What's up, man?
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.200]   >> Hey, good morning.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.360]   >> I want to talk about Fred's- >> Slave to the camera.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.880]   >> [LAUGH] >> Go like this to the camera.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.400]   >> I really, truly want you to do that.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.080]   >> You guys have one of the, I mean, you guys are like relationship goals.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.640]   Everyone wants to fall in love young and then be married for, how old are you guys now?
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.480]   >> I'm 81, Fred's 84.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.880]   >> So it's been- >> 57 years.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.840]   >> 57 years.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.320]   >> 58 in August, if the Lord is willing.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.920]   >> Yeah, and you guys are still just as in love as you were when you-
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.880]   >> You betcha, all right.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.000]   But you work on that, and you do sweet things.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.400]   And Fred is the easiest guy ever.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.000]   >> Yeah. >> I mean,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.520]   he's the one that probably needs prayers cuz I just don't ever sit down and
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.520]   he would like to sit down.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.360]   But we have definite times that we're together.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.680]   We, at seven o'clock in the evening, then I don't answer the phone.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.120]   That's our time.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.160]   We'll watch a Hallmark movie or something that we enjoy together.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.880]   In the morning, our prayer time, every meal we do together.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.640]   And after supper, we do a little devotional.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.480]   It's totally hooked together with God as the center.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.920]   I don't know how you would do it otherwise.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.880]   >> For the first while of your relationship, when was that when you guys
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.560]   started writing letters back and forth for those few years?
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.520]   >> Then he went in the Army, and we wrote, and we fell in love.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.920]   I mean, I- >> Kind of fell in love.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.000]   >> Well, I remember one time I didn't get a letter when I thought I should.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.520]   And then it bothered me, so I thought, that's a good sign.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.640]   >> Yeah, that's a good sign.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.120]   >> Yeah, and I would, for like three days, run home in between classes.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.680]   And when that letter came, it just, and he felt the same way.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.840]   Because if he didn't write, then I wasn't either, that's how we used to do it.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.720]   >> Yeah, that's how I can relate to that, because my girls are the same way.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.800]   >> Yeah, so we just kind of, yeah, I don't call guys, I mean,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.040]   I hardly call Fred, and it's kind of the old-fashioned courtship.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.240]   >> That's good, though, that's good.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.840]   How long did it take to see the letters, when you sent it, how long did it take?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.960]   >> Probably it was, he was in Germany, so probably a week.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.600]   >> And that was your only way of communication?
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.560]   >> Yeah, and then I just was busy going to school and then student teaching.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.080]   And I just was so thankful I didn't have to be dating or
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.800]   do anything, but, cuz I was also working.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.520]   So it worked, it was a beautiful plan.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.600]   >> Yeah, it worked out.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.960]   >> How the Lord directed that is the best testimony in my life.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.240]   He was in control of everything.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.000]   >> Yeah, that's big time, that's awesome.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.720]   So, like I said earlier, when I tell people,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.480]   do you wanna meet an angel in real life, I say you need to meet Aunt Nancy.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.600]   Have you- >> Thank you, Michael.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.240]   >> I wanna ask you this, have you ever heard the audible voice of God?
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.000]   And have you ever, has that ever happened to you?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.640]   >> I know, but so clearly in my heart.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.560]   >> Yeah. >> You just feel it.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.840]   >> Yeah, so clearly in my heart.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.120]   >> I keep asking, when you want an outward sign, okay, write me a letter,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.680]   let me know, cuz sometimes we think, is that really coming from the Lord?
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.240]   No, but I don't need that to know it's so true.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.000]   >> Right, it's like a peace.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400]   >> It is a peace, yeah.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.080]   >> For me, the stuff that happens to me, I think I have dreams and
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   I'll have just too many coincidences where I know he's just lining stuff up
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.120]   perfectly for me.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.400]   And then, like you said, some stuff will happen, it's just like,
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.240]   when you have the Holy Spirit inside your heart, he just directs you.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.560]   He tells you kind of like no, or he gives you a conscience to where you
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.520]   don't do certain things and he's leading you a certain way.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.120]   But that's some stuff that
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.520]   you would never know unless you really start following God, you know what I mean?
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   >> I always say, okay, I would really like to dream about you tonight, but
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.400]   it hasn't happened.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.680]   >> Really? >> Yeah, isn't that funny?
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   I just can't, come on, I'm waiting.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.000]   >> Yeah, I bet you will, I bet you will.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.120]   >> Well, either way it's there, so I don't need that, but that would be like, whoa.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.240]   >> It's happened to me once or twice and it's so fun.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.960]   >> That has to be so cool.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   >> Yeah, cuz a lot of people in this day and age, they say there's no proof for
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.880]   God, or I've heard that before, where's the real proof that there's a God?
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.120]   And I say, the most proof that you have is your own personal testimony,
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.920]   and you know what he's done to you, and you know how he's changed your heart, and
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.560]   like what he's shown you.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.280]   And people might not understand that, but you know what I'm talking about.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.600]   >> I do know what you're talking about.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.000]   And, Michael, they don't really need words,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.480]   they just need us to live our lives the way we're supposed to.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.840]   Cuz that's the real one.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.880]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.000]   >> When they see us live differently.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.360]   >> And I love every day to say, Lord, direct my path, my thoughts, my words,
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.640]   my actions, my relationships.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.840]   And I pray that prayer for all my nieces and nephews, and
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.800]   grant them wisdom, cuz I don't wanna do life without them.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.760]   I don't think I'd get out of bed if I didn't feel confident that
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.360]   he was gonna direct my day.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.320]   We've got a purpose.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.360]   And you know one thing I think our purpose is?
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.400]   Our purpose is to love everybody always, and
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.880]   not judge, cuz we're not the judge, God's the judge.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.280]   But love them anyway, and don't try to figure out why people do what they do.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.480]   And I think only through the grace of the Holy Spirit can you do that.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.000]   >> Right.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.120]   >> And I know all my people are kind of people that I've grown up with or
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.840]   have done life with, but you've got a bigger, it's harder for
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.640]   young people to love people that might be talking about you or whatever.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.800]   >> Yeah, I mean, that is something I definitely can struggle with,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.840]   like holding a grudge, or like you said, when people are talking bad about you or
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.800]   whatever, and just seeing the best in them and choosing to love them.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.320]   But I told you earlier, I'm watching a sermon series, and
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.000]   it talks about love, and how to love.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.120]   And what it kind of talked about was just receiving God's love.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.400]   If you really think about it, we're so messed up, and
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.040]   we've done so many crazy things, but he loves us just the same.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.780]   So if we can really experience that, and accept that, and
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.360]   spend time with him, and realize his love for us, that's the only way we can go out
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.160]   and love other people, but it's not just a willpower thing.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.960]   You don't just will yourself to go be super nice to everybody and
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.200]   love everybody good.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.800]   It's like when you're spending time with God and he's loving you,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.520]   it can just pour out of you.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.000]   And that's the only, I'm just now starting to learn that, so I'm about to start-
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.680]   >> That's so funny, and you're a young kid.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.760]   >> Yeah, I'm about to start trying it.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.600]   But because for me, a struggle for me has just been trying to have the willpower to
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.120]   be a good guy and be nice, and that hasn't worked out great, so.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.320]   >> But you're on a journey.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.520]   The whole life is a journey, and I'm not where I want to be.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.880]   I'm totally prairie that I can grow closer to Christ every day.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   I'm not there.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   I won't be there until I get to heaven.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.360]   But I totally love the journey.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   I want to share this thought, and it wasn't mine.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.920]   It was on Christian radio.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.880]   They were talking about games families play at Christmas or Thanksgiving.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.080]   And then the minister said, there is a game that people play all the time.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.800]   They play God.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.720]   And how do they do it?
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   Cuz they're judging others.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.000]   When you judge somebody else, you're playing God, and that is not okay.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.560]   That's not our job.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.960]   But Satan loves it when you judge, cuz then you're doing his work.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.320]   >> Yeah. >> So I don't wanna do his work.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.680]   >> Right. >> And judging,
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.840]   I don't know the answer.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.280]   We don't know what people have been going through and what.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.800]   And I think once you get rid of that judging, and
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.680]   trying to figure out why people do what they do, cuz we'll never know.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   But that's God's business.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.640]   Isn't that powerful?
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.400]   >> It is.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.360]   It's God's business.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.080]   And on top of that, we don't know everything that led that person to be
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.800]   the person they are.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.120]   Maybe they weren't as blessed as us to grow up in the families that we grew up in.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.200]   And have the guidance that we have.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   There's no judging, I see what you're saying.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.080]   And if today's world knew that, and could live even a little bit like that,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.720]   I feel like the whole world would be in such a better place.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.080]   >> It would be such a better place.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.280]   >> But- >> But we can make a difference.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.000]   >> We can make a difference.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.080]   >> Right where we are.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.480]   >> We can, and I think a lot of it has to do with the social media era.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.160]   Like when you are posting stuff all the time, it can kind of bring out a type of,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.720]   and you're not really on social media, so you wouldn't really know this.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.680]   But it can cause you to compare yourself to other people.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.080]   And it can cause you to judge what other people are doing.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.320]   And it just creates this society where it's like, who's better than who?
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.440]   Who's doing the best?
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.600]   And it's tough, and I've realized that.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.880]   And that's why for me, I had to get off of social media.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.480]   >> Good for you, good for you.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.000]   >> Yeah, I had to get off of it because- >> They say the human brain can,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.480]   I mean, a billion good things can happen in one day.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.360]   But if one negative thing happens, or you hear a negative thought,
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.840]   what do we take home, that negative thought?
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.760]   Our brain is made to do that.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:26.680]   So the least, I mean, just, yeah, social media, I have no interest in.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.040]   >> Yeah, it's, and you see that in professional athletes.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.960]   Like, the best athletes in the world who have everything, but
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.080]   then if they have a bad game and people are commenting on their page,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.440]   then they're gonna see that, and that affects them.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.320]   And as much as us as dudes like to act like that stuff doesn't affect us,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.520]   like it does when people are talking negative about you.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.600]   >> Because we're human.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.740]   >> We're all human, and then on top of that, it's like people,
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.120]   when they see athletes or famous people, they don't view them as regular people.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.960]   They view them like they can just say whatever to them, and
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.720]   it doesn't affect them.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.960]   But in reality, that type of stuff affects everybody.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.400]   And so, it's better not to fill your mind with that stuff.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.160]   And just, cuz at the end of the day, the people that don't know you,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.920]   like their opinion doesn't necessarily matter.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.840]   But still, seeing it, it can affect you.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.280]   So for me, it was like, why even entertain that?
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.480]   Why not just get off of social media and
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.600]   really invest in the relationships I already have?
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.320]   >> That's so smart.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.280]   >> And- >> Please stay off.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.480]   >> Yeah, I plan to, and that's honestly why I'm doing this right here, so
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.520]   people can still hear my voice and hear my thoughts.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.280]   But it's not gonna be through Instagram, and it's not gonna be through Twitter.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.480]   Because I've just been on and off of it enough to realize that I'm my best self,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.640]   and I'm better when I'm off social media.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.960]   So yeah, that's what I decided.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.160]   >> And I always think, too, girl, I mean, of course,
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.800]   I had different stages in my life.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.080]   But when you're doing all this pure stuff, and
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   I didn't even think about it when I was your age,
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.840]   you're so far ahead of me when I was your age.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.800]   But I just think, if God is for me, who can be against that counts?
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.440]   I mean, if God is for us, and that's if we're his kids, and
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.840]   we're living to honor him, who can be against us, that matters.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.640]   Nobody does, I mean, nobody's that powerful.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.200]   >> Right, you should consider writing a book.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.400]   >> No, but- >> I think that people will,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.960]   actually, a lot of people will hear your stuff from this, hopefully, Lord willing.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.560]   But you live a- >> My life is so simple.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.680]   >> That's what I'm saying, it's so rare these days for someone to live a simple life.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.560]   People need to hear that, and
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.240]   I'm glad that they're gonna be able to hear about it through this.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.000]   That's why I wanted to do this with you,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.600]   because that's something the world needs, is simplicity.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.360]   And I feel like simplicity is a key to happiness and joy, you know what I mean?
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.120]   There's so many distractions in the world today, but
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.400]   I feel like the happiest people keep it simple, and they just stick to God's word,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.600]   and God's plan for their life, and they don't really go outside of that.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.880]   But I just feel like, in America especially,
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.600]   they throw so much at you, it's so easy to get distracted.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:15.720]   >> So Michael, how does that, I mean, with you, how hard it must be to live simply?
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.360]   >> In my position, it's almost impossible, just because of the lifestyle that I'm in.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.720]   But for me, it's making it as simple as possible, you know what I mean?
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.840]   So getting off of social media, that was one thing.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.680]   And then for me, the other thing is I'm gonna be seeing certain things and
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.600]   be around certain people just because of the profession I'm in.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.800]   But what I do in my free time, and
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.240]   that's where I really wanna live that simplistic life.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:48.480]   What I do on the court, and who I am on the court, and who I am off the court.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.400]   I just wanna live a simple life, and pay attention to the important things,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.920]   not be fed with all the distractions of social media.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.840]   I really respect Kawhi Leonard.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.480]   He's a player in the NBA who hasn't had social media.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.880]   Do you even know who Kawhi Leonard is?
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.400]   >> No.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.800]   >> [LAUGH] Well, he hasn't had social media like this whole time.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.880]   >> Is he a ball player?
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.680]   >> Yeah, he's one of the best in the NBA.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.520]   >> But I will get to know him by listening.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.400]   >> If you watch our, we played him in the playoffs.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.880]   You remember when we played the Clippers?
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.840]   >> Yeah, but I only look at you.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.680]   >> So we played, yeah, he was the best player on the Clippers.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.560]   >> What's his name?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.400]   >> Kawhi Leonard.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.160]   >> Okay, I think I do remember.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.760]   >> Yeah, no, he's really good.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.960]   But he hasn't been on social media since he's been in the NBA, I think.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.640]   And yeah, I don't see myself going back to it, cuz I do want to be intentional
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.160]   about living as simply as I can, you know what I mean?
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   >> I know something that works really for me, and you're gonna laugh.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.200]   My thing is, if I buy something, if I go to the Academy Sports and
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:00.000]   get a new fleece, then I have to get rid of one of my, to take it to Goodwill.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.520]   >> Really?
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.720]   >> You could do that.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.400]   If you buy something, then you need to look in your closet and give something.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.560]   >> I should do that, because I have way too much clothes.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.320]   I kid you not, you would love it.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.840]   It just, so I think- >> So as you get stuff coming in,
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.960]   you take something to Goodwill.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.880]   >> I'll go, okay, and then you can take it to a shelter,
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   you can take it to somebody who needs it.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.320]   It feels so good.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:28.160]   In my closet, in one closet, I have all my clothes from winter to summer.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.960]   And so before I buy something, I'll think,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.960]   is there anything I'm gonna wanna get rid of?
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.240]   Half the time, I, no, I like what I have, so I don't even get it.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.960]   Even if it's 9.99, no, I don't need it.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.720]   >> That's actually really, really smart.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.960]   >> I don't dare you, but I want you to think about it.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.280]   >> I'm gonna do it, no, I'm gonna do it, cuz I have so
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.680]   much stuff that I just continue to get, and it just piles up.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.120]   But I'm like, that's smart, taking, as stuff comes in, take the stuff and-
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.760]   >> Well, then just put it in a bag,
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.800]   like for Goodwill or a homeless shelter or something.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.240]   >> Mm-hm.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.360]   >> I want you to try it, you'll be amazed.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.200]   >> I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, no, I'm seriously gonna do it.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.800]   The last thing I kinda wanted to touch on with you is,
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.960]   I wanted to talk a little bit about Christianity and Catholicism.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.240]   Cuz you're Catholic, right?
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.160]   >> Yes, I am.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.760]   >> And Catholicism, that's not, that's not, that doesn't mean bad.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.280]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.320]   >> You're Catholicism.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:27.820]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.000]   >> So what'd I say, Catholicism?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.120]   >> [LAUGH] No, that is so, that's kind of a new word.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.840]   >> So, I don't know why, I went to a Catholic school, but I'm Christian.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.600]   And I kinda like, you get the sense that Catholics sometimes have something
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.440]   against Christians, and Christians sometimes have a thing against Catholics.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.280]   >> No, cuz we are Christians.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.560]   >> We are, but- >> Yeah.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.480]   >> I was just gonna ask you, don't you believe the main
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.280]   thing is a relationship with Jesus?
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.280]   >> Any, like, whatever it is, it's the relationship with Jesus.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.720]   >> Absolutely. >> And that's what he's after.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.840]   >> And I just know from being around both, being around a lot of Christian people,
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.400]   a lot of Catholic people, they get so stuck to this religion that they lose
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.120]   like the main point of it all, which is the relationship.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.080]   That's all Jesus wants.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.400]   >> That's all it is.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.800]   And I think what is confusing, cuz it's,
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.200]   there's a lot of church rituals that people, we know what they mean, and
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.160]   they're all based on scripture, but it is about the relationship.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.640]   And I just remember one time when I was teaching school,
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.680]   my parents that I was gonna have, they came in and
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:42.200]   they said, we wanted you for a teacher cuz we heard you were Christian.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.160]   And I said, yes, I am a Catholic Christian.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.960]   And they went, Catholics can be Christians?
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.480]   Okay, see, that is such a myth.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.200]   And that's, we're all about Christ.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.360]   >> Right. >> And our relationship with him.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.200]   >> So then what's the main difference, you think?
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.760]   >> There's, the main difference, all right, here's the deal, how I feel.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.200]   I was blessed to be in a parochial school, too,
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.600]   cuz I didn't get any spiritual growth from my family.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.920]   I got it all from the nuns.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.360]   And that's, from the time I was seven, I asked Jesus into my heart.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.720]   And the nuns gave me the Ten Commandments.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.680]   I had my boundaries, cuz I wasn't getting boundaries at home.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   But I loved the boundaries.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.400]   It made me feel safe, and there isn't any difference.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:39.200]   But the Eucharist, when we have communion, we believe it's Jesus.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.000]   And I know when I would break bread with you anytime at your church,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.660]   cuz I love, I will go to any Christian church and
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.800]   worship with my loved ones, my family.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.800]   >> And, but for me, the Catholic Church kinda probably saved my life,
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.440]   cuz I didn't get direction at home.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.640]   >> Right. >> I got it through the church.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.600]   >> Right. >> But there's not a lot of
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:07.760]   difference, except, cuz sometimes you think certain denominations are better.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.560]   We're not better.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.720]   We're all the same with the same God, the same Lord.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.800]   >> That's how I feel.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.680]   But I just, being around it, at the Catholic school I was at, and
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.360]   just being around a lot of different Christians, they think it's so different.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:27.040]   But the way I look at it is, when Jesus died on the cross, he died for everybody.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.200]   So that doesn't matter if you're a Catholic, Christian, whatever you are.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.840]   >> Absolutely.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.240]   >> But that's the main point, is the relationship with Jesus.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.160]   But there's a lot of stuff in the Bible that's not necessarily black and white.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.280]   And there's some stuff that different denominations might take it this way or
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.960]   other Catholics might take it this way, whatever.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.040]   But the main point is the relationship.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.960]   Lecrae, who's another guy that I'm gonna be interviewing,
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.200]   he talks about how he just lost his religion and found Jesus.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   A lot of people cling so hard to this religion that they have, but
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:03.280]   they don't even invest in the relationship with Jesus, you know what I mean?
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.320]   >> Michael, that is so profound.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.640]   And that's exactly in any religion.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.760]   You can go through it and then you have nothing when it's time to leave your
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.000]   parents, and you don't have their faith to carry you on.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.480]   It's nothing about all the man-made or church rules.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   And all those things, and all of the scriptures there to guide us,
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.240]   that's our textbook for life, that's our blueprint for life.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.040]   It's all about you need the relationship if you're gonna have anything.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.760]   It's not what you were saying.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.600]   It is just not the church, it is your relationship.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.840]   And then, I love my traditions cuz it's like when I go to mass,
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.320]   I just feel like I'm home cuz that was my home.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.160]   But I could go worship with anybody, any Christian church, and
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.680]   they could be playing music and singing, and I feel so comfortable there too.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.560]   >> Right, right.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.440]   >> Yeah, but that was a good question cuz I think when we were little,
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:09.200]   we were kinda taught as a little kid that we couldn't go to a non-Catholic church.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.640]   But the Catholic church is not that way anymore.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:19.760]   We know that we're all worshiping the same Christ, and we follow him.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.520]   But we've come a long way, and I'm so proud of that.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.400]   Our leadership's so much better now.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.520]   >> And I don't think a lot of people are really aware of that,
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   that you can be different denominations, or Catholic, or whatever.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.240]   And still, the main goal is the same thing, we all want the same thing.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.400]   >> Exactly, and we are all sinners.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   And those little kids that go to proky school can be rascals,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.280]   just like anybody else.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.560]   And you know that, cuz you went, and- >> Exactly.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.360]   >> They're just kids, and human, and without the relationship.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.240]   And I think the terminology was always different.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.760]   It was always there, but until I got into a Bible study as an adult,
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.200]   it all came together.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.920]   >> Yeah, well, this has been amazing.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.480]   Honestly, we should have done this even if it wasn't like-
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.240]   >> I know, I feel like I know you better.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.360]   >> That's what I'm saying.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.000]   >> And Michael, truly, I promised you prayers on your 16th birthday.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.400]   I've been praying for you forever, about God directing your path.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.680]   >> Mm-hm.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:28.040]   >> And I just would love to be a support person for you, and for you.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.880]   Cuz I think that's what the Lord wants me to do, reach out.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.240]   And I just love everybody always, and believe in them.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.200]   >> Thank you.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.560]   >> Cuz there's nothing that anybody could do that would make me love them less.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.880]   >> Yeah. >> But I know your journey looks so
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.760]   much different- >> Right.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   >> Than mine.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.240]   >> Mm-hm, honestly, no, I love talking to you, and I love when you reach out.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.440]   And when we go, when we hang in Colorado, it's always so refreshing for me to just.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   >> I know, I just love you, and I always think you're like mine.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   I know we're at Jan's house, but you're mine, yeah.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.600]   >> For sure. >> I feel that way about all of you, but
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.440]   the blessing of you guys moving here.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.520]   >> Yeah. >> When your grandma was passing away,
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.480]   and I said to her, I will watch over your kids.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.560]   >> Mm-hm. >> Meaning every day I'll pray, and
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   I kept my promise, every day I've prayed for all of Judy's kids and their kids.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.920]   And lo and behold, you came here and went, well, whoa.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:36.560]   I've got, remember down Flat Branch, floating the sticks and walking around?
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.920]   And then when you'd say, we'd walk, and you'd go, hey, Aunt Nancy, and
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.480]   everybody would look like, that's his aunt?
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.680]   I was so proud.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.920]   >> [LAUGH] >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.120]   >> It is crazy.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.800]   >> Yeah. >> No, it is crazy.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:54.040]   >> Cuz like you and Judy, you guys are also short, but then my mom's so
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.680]   tall, and then when they see me hanging with you, they're like, whoa,
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.520]   how does he have an aunt that short?
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:03.000]   >> I know, I know, but I always tell people when they say, okay, no,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.720]   I'm related to the Porters, and they'll go, you are?
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.280]   I went, yeah, I used to be that tall.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.260]   >> [LAUGH] >> Yeah,
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.960]   cuz you know how you shrink when you age?
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.600]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah, I used to be that tall.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.880]   >> Have you shrunk?
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.600]   >> Not yet.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.240]   I think keep jogging and- >> No, keep doing your planking.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.160]   >> Keep planking and keep your bones strong.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.600]   >> You'll be good, but I love you and I'm glad you did it.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.320]   >> I love you, and Michael, please know that I might not be at your games, but
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:31.000]   my spirit, and you're too, I'm with you, my darling.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.360]   I love you guys so much, and I love your mom like a daughter.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.920]   I mean, I do, and I love you guys like a grandma.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.480]   >> Thank you.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.560]   >> I think that's one notch up from an aunt.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.540]   >> My grandma?
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.440]   >> No, I mean, I don't ever take Judy's place, but I love you like a grandma.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.880]   >> Thanks, you don't give us candy like she did though.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.640]   >> No, cuz I would give you a rice cake.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.840]   >> [LAUGH] >> Yeah, and no, and I would obey your mom.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.520]   She said no cake, I would, but Judy was always my, Judy was my favorite rascal.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.200]   >> I got so much candy and so much goods from going to her mom.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.960]   >> I know, but she loved that, and that was one thing she could do.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.960]   >> No, I love that, she was a rascal.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.060]   >> Yeah, even growing up, she was my favorite little friend to play with.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.580]   >> Really?
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.260]   >> Yeah, we would have a club called the Roy Rogers Club or
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.740]   the Captain Marvel Club, we'd collect the dues and go get ice cream.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.500]   >> She's so fun.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.100]   >> What were you thinking?
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.800]   >> She's hilarious, I miss her.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.780]   >> Yeah, she's in heaven watching over, trust me, she's proud.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.380]   >> Thank you.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.180]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.420]   >> Thank you, all righty, well, let's wrap this up.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.960]   >> This has been amazing, we're out.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.680]   Should we do the plank while we're- >> To tape it?
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.080]   >> Two and a half minutes, right now, whatever, let's do it.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.760]   >> Well.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.400]   >> I actually need, it's gonna be good cuz I need to do it.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.680]   >> Okay, but this is hilarious.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.840]   >> Alexa, set the timer for two and a half minutes.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:04.560]   >> Set the timer for two minutes, three seconds, starting now.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.480]   >> Okay, I'm Michael, yeah, let's talk.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.820]   >> I always like to talk.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.080]   >> You do, I'm already tired.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.440]   >> [LAUGH] You're so cute.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.060]   >> I have something I'd like to talk about.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.780]   >> All right, so what do you want to talk about?
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.400]   >> I want to ask you questions now.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.580]   >> Yeah, ask me something.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:26.560]   >> Alexa, stop, Alexa, turn the volume to seven.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.580]   >> [LAUGH] >> All right, Michael.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.780]   >> [INAUDIBLE] >> I think she's wearing out.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.220]   >> [INAUDIBLE] >> What did you say?
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.980]   >> Wait, have you done it today, you're playing?
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.380]   >> Yeah, but that's okay, I'll do anything for you, remember?
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.520]   >> Thanks. >> All right, Michael.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.140]   >> What is it like living- >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.860]   >> My goodness, Alexa.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.100]   >> Alexa, be quiet.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.660]   >> [LAUGH] >> Let's see if that works.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:55.500]   >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Alexa, stop.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:00.260]   Okay, that was funny, she said, I've never heard her do this.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.980]   >> [LAUGH] >> We have no idea.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.780]   >> How long has it been?
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.020]   >> All right, Alexa, how many minutes to the timer?
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:12.300]   >> You have two timers, a two-minute and 30-second timer.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.540]   It's about one minute left.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.220]   >> One minute, that's a piece of cake.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:19.380]   All right, Michael, when did you know,
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.660]   when did you really accept Christ in your heart?
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:32.100]   >> For me, it was like, I just grew up with that.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.380]   But then I didn't really accept it for my own whenever I went to college.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.260]   Man, I'm too tired to talk about this right now.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.380]   >> [LAUGH] >> Okay, you ask me a question then.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:45.180]   >> But I'll, we only have- >> Okay, Michael.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.540]   >> Huh?
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.660]   >> Okay, I was seven when I did.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.380]   >> I think I did at Mama's College.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.540]   I mean, I accepted him earlier, but really trying to live for him was college.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.740]   >> Okay, I would probably never have been who I was if I didn't get him really quick
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.020]   in my life, cuz I had kind of a rougher childhood.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.820]   >> Yeah. >> It brought joy to it, though.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.700]   >> I wanna hear what your childhood actually is.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.620]   Alexa, how much time left on the timer?
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.820]   >> [LAUGH] >> You have two minutes.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.860]   >> That's it.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.140]   >> [SOUND] >> We have ten seconds left.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.380]   >> Okay, that was fun.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.300]   >> Wasn't that fun?
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.100]   >> No.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.540]   >> [LAUGH]
