[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   - Chamath, who are you giggling with?
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.540]   Are you with your kids?
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.540]   What's going on here?
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.540]   You're making googly face.
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.420]   - I got a message from that.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.120]   - Oh no, is it Hellmuth?
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.860]   - No, no, I got a message from that.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.820]   She's so funny.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.500]   So I was like, blah, blah, blah.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   She did a Uranus joke into my chat and I lost it.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.960]   - It is like Friedberg always says,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.760]   Uranus is right there at the edge of the universe.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.200]   No, she's like, are you hungry?
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.080]   I could eat a Uranus.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.880]   Oh no, we could go to a great restaurant, Uranus.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.520]   They serve great meals there.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.540]   They have a great chocolate lava cake.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:56.080]   - All right, everybody.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.800]   Welcome back to your favorite podcast of all time.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.040]   It's episode 169 of All In with me again,
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.980]   the chairman dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.480]   David Friedberg, your Sultan of Science
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.280]   and the Rain Man, yeah.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.680]   Definitely David Sacks has his Montclair hat back again.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.980]   I guess they're back in stock.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.820]   How we doing boys?
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.080]   Welcome back to the show.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.920]   Let's get to the docket here.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   Issue one, Elon has sued OpenAI, begun the meme wars have.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.800]   After we finished the recording last week,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.520]   the memes are incredible.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.760]   After we finished recording last week,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.960]   Elon sued Sam Waltman, Greg Brockman
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.020]   and the OpenAI organization.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.240]   He's suing for breach of contract,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.420]   fiduciary duty and unfair competition.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.760]   And his argument is basically OpenAI started
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.880]   as an open source nonprofit.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.120]   As you know, he gave them something like 50 or 75 million
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.320]   of both those numbers quoted.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560]   And then of course, everybody knows OpenAI
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   turned into closed AI.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.280]   They became a closed source for profit venture
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.420]   after the tech was deployed.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260]   This enabled them obviously to benefit
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.820]   from nonprofit tax breaks while building the tech,
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.260]   but they now have two corporate entities.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.240]   There's this nonprofit called OpenAI.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.640]   There's a for-profit, it's called OpenAI Global LLC.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.900]   That was created in 2019.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.320]   And there's all this funky relationship between the two.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.160]   We'll get into that
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.520]   'cause it's kind of interesting actually.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.020]   Elon said that if OpenAI is allowed to do this,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.020]   then it should be the standard
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.160]   for every company going forward.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.400]   That's an interesting point.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.240]   You can start by donating money to a nonprofit
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.160]   and then make a for-profit.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.640]   It seems pretty capital efficient.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.620]   So what does Elon want to get out of this?
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.680]   According to the lawsuit,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.380]   he wants OpenAI to open source their models.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.760]   By the way, that's what Facebook and Apple
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   are doing right now.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.920]   So that seems more than reasonable
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.280]   since that's how the company was formed.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.720]   And he wants to make sure that shareholders
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.080]   receive no financial benefit from OpenAI.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.260]   And we can get more into a bunch of the OpenAI
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.400]   nonprofit status and their structure.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880]   It's super convoluted.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.080]   But I want to just get your initial reaction, Sax.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.280]   I haven't read the legal filings, Jason.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.240]   My knowledge of the case
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.480]   is just coming from following what's on Twitter.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.320]   And the last time I commented on one of Elon's lawsuits
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.080]   on this pod, I ended up in six hours of deposition.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   So remember that was the whole Twitter lawsuit.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.060]   At any event, my understanding of the case
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.920]   from the tweets that are flying back and forth
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.260]   is I think Elon is making two points.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.540]   One is that when OpenAI was set up,
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.260]   it was set up to be a nonprofit
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.160]   and to promote AI as an open source technology
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.840]   that everyone could benefit from
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.540]   and no one large tech company would control.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.320]   In that case, Elon was primarily concerned about Google.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.560]   I think now he's more concerned about Microsoft.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.420]   Nonetheless, the idea was that this would be open source.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.020]   So I think point number one is Elon feels
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.060]   like the rug was pulled out from under him
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.040]   after he donated 40 something million dollars to this.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.380]   They completely changed what it was gonna be.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.620]   And I think he's used the word swindled before.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.120]   He feels like he was cheated.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.620]   And I think usually when there's a lawsuit like this,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.420]   it's usually because somebody does feel
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.140]   fundamentally cheated by what happened.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.700]   So I think that's the first point.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.320]   The second is that I think that Elon's making is,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.020]   well, wait a second, if you can start a company
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.160]   as a nonprofit using pre-tax dollars
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.640]   and then all of a sudden convert to for-profit,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.080]   then why wouldn't everybody do this
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.160]   in order to circumvent paying taxes?
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.880]   And I think that's another, I'd say,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.020]   valid and interesting point that he's made.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.520]   Now, OpenAI has responded to this
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.220]   by publishing some of Elon's emails to them.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.300]   And they think that they have a smoking gun here
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.440]   because apparently Elon told them
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.280]   they need to raise far more money
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.540]   in order to have a chance of taking on Google/DeepMind.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.160]   I just don't know whether that's the smoking gun
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.940]   they claim it is, but that's basically
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.580]   what they're putting out there.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.460]   And then to add fuel to the fire,
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.080]   you've got VCs coming over the top
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.060]   debating different aspects of this.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.020]   You've got sort of Vinod defending OpenAI.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.240]   He was the first VC investor in it.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.860]   And so he's been out there attacking Elon.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.860]   And then I think Marc Andreessen is responding to Vinod.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.260]   I don't know if he's exactly defending Elon.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.560]   Anyway, it's turned into a whole maelstrom on X,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.340]   and then everyone else is starting
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.780]   to put out a whole bunch of crazy memes.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.380]   So I don't know who's gonna win this case in court,
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.500]   but the memes are definitely lit.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.020]   And maybe the funniest one is that Elon has said
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.420]   that if OpenAI will simply change their name
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.800]   to ClosedAI, he'll drop the lawsuit.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.280]   - I think he's serious about that.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.660]   - I think he is serious about it,
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.040]   but I think he's making his point,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.900]   which is you ended up doing something different
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.620]   than what you told me when you got me
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.780]   to write this big donation,
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.620]   and when we co-founded this thing together.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.720]   So I think that sort of sums up Elon's position on this.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.460]   - Chamath, a year from now,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.340]   where do you think we'll be with this?
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.500]   - Well, I think there's one more thing,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   which is that they used his name pretty aggressively
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.120]   to get more money.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.380]   And he was very instrumental
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.340]   in getting some of the early critical hires,
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.420]   particularly Ilya, which has been, I think,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.300]   well-documented to leave Google, right?
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.020]   So that's probably sacks where also some of this feeling
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.180]   that he was bamboozled comes from.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.540]   But I think that all of those emotions matter less
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.800]   than the rule of law, which is his second point,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.540]   which is the important point,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.880]   irrespective of whatever one email says or another email.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.720]   It's not great for the US tax system
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.480]   if all of a sudden a big gaping loophole
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.620]   is identified and taken advantage of.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.680]   I think that there's a huge economic incentive
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.100]   for the state of California,
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.960]   every other state where these open AI employees lived
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.740]   and have gotten equity and now have gotten paid.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.000]   There's an incentive for treasury.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.860]   There's an incentive for the IRS.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.480]   It touches a lot of aspects of very complicated tax law.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.740]   And so I think that's why there will be a resolution
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.820]   to this case, because I think that that answer
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.780]   is very important.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.660]   And I think it will, as he has correctly identified,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.800]   motivate a lot of people's actions going forward.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.460]   So independent of what the emotional situation is
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.340]   amongst all the actors in this play,
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.540]   the reality is he's identified a loophole
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.860]   and that loophole needs to get fixed.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.100]   I'll give you a different example of this
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.140]   that's much more benign,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.360]   but it dragged on for eight or nine years.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.740]   At Facebook, there was a period where,
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.180]   and this was public, so I can tell you,
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.100]   we transferred a lot of our IP to Ireland at one moment
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.620]   and there was a transfer payment and whatnot.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.260]   And then a few years afterwards when everybody realized,
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.160]   including us, and we had miscalculated,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.140]   but when everybody realized the value of Facebook,
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.380]   that transfer payment did not seem correct.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.140]   And it was a huge tax arb that we had facilitated, right?
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.140]   Because all of that IP sitting inside of Ireland
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.140]   gets taxed at a very different rate
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.440]   than that IP would have gotten taxed in the United States.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.580]   And other companies had copied this.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.420]   Long story short, the IRS sued.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.380]   Similar to you, David, I was in years of depositions
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.460]   and interviews and all of this stuff.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.060]   So the point is that the government really cares
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.240]   about these kinds of things
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.960]   because so much money is on the line.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.980]   And if OpenAI turns out to be
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.780]   this multi-hundred billion dollar behemoth,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.860]   this will get figured out in court
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.240]   because there's just too much money at stake.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.060]   - Freeberg, any thoughts and maybe Steelman,
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.140]   if you feel like it, OpenAI's position?
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.000]   - I think we're all ignoring the documents
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.700]   that OpenAI put out yesterday,
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.100]   showing emails and interactions with Elon,
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.100]   where Elon acknowledged and recognized the necessity
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.120]   of having a for-profit subsidiary
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.460]   that could pursue the interests of the foundation
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.000]   by raising billions of dollars of outside capital.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.080]   I think it's a really interesting set of facts
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.300]   that provides a different light on the story.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.860]   And it was really important that OpenAI released it.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.080]   I'm gonna share a-
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.220]   - Hold on, I didn't mention that.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.560]   - Freeberg, I mentioned that too.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.720]   My point is it doesn't allow you to break the law.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.580]   - Yeah, so let me just tell you guys a little bit
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.720]   about another example.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.820]   My sister works at a nonprofit
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.980]   called the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.860]   Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disorder,
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.760]   affects the lungs and digestive tract.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.660]   It's debilitating, really affects children.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.760]   There was a nonprofit called
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.360]   the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation established in 1955.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.540]   They did tons of work on drug development research.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.860]   And it was a nonprofit for years until they realized
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.680]   that there needed to be a market-based system
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.240]   to create the necessary incentives
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.000]   to drive the capital needed to find a drug
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.300]   that could cure cystic fibrosis.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.480]   And in the year 2000,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.060]   they invested out of their foundation endowment,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.140]   $40 million in a company called Aurora Biosciences.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.280]   Subsequently, it was acquired by Vertex
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   and they continued to invest another $60 million,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.100]   so a total of 100 million bucks in the lifetime
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.740]   of the development of a drug that could cure this disease.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.300]   In 2005, a drug was discovered,
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.180]   and in 2012, the FDA approved it.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.560]   The nonprofit then sold their rights,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   their interest in this for-profit entity for $3.3 billion.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.860]   It was an incredible return.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.500]   It was the largest investment return
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.660]   by a nonprofit in history.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.700]   - Who do they sell it to, back to the company?
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.260]   - I actually think they sold the rights to royalty pharma,
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.420]   who you and I know well.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.180]   And that $3.3 billion opened up this ability
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.620]   for them to continue to make investments.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.620]   They now fund biotech VCs
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.680]   and they make direct investments and other things.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   But it really set the benchmark for this concept
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.500]   of what's called venture philanthropy,
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.260]   where a nonprofit parent company can make investments
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.060]   in for-profits that can raise additional capital
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.400]   that's needed to pursue the broad, difficult interests
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.860]   of the nonprofit.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.180]   And I think that this argument really kind of ties
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.500]   into what happened with OpenAI.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.060]   And you can see it in the email exchanges with Elon,
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.460]   where he was so prescient
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.720]   that I give Elon extraordinary credit for this,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.740]   that he saw that this is going to take billions of dollars
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.260]   a year of investment to realize the pursuit
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.620]   that OpenAI was going after.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.420]   And there was no way that Elon was going to be able
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.060]   to generate that cash himself or that Reid or others
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.060]   were going to just be able to pony up that money.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.600]   They needed to have some sort of for-profit vehicle
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.100]   that would allow the market to work
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.660]   and allow capitalists to find their capital
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.540]   into this organization to make this investment interest.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.340]   So I think the real question with respect
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.580]   to is OpenAI in trouble as a foundation
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.100]   is does the nonprofit own a meaningful piece
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.420]   of the for-profit entity?
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.420]   And I don't know the answer to that.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.640]   I don't know if you guys do.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.480]   - Sounds like it.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.820]   I mean, yeah, it must, right?
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.900]   - So if they do, then they have an investment interest.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.180]   The second question is does the nonprofit parent
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.280]   still do charitable stuff?
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.900]   Because if it doesn't, then there's a real question
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.220]   on the nonprofit status.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   I think you have to have a certain amount of your assets
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.860]   deployed every year in order to qualify for 501(c)(3).
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.600]   So I think the test and the courts will likely end up being,
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.260]   look, it's totally reasonable to have a for-profit entity,
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.420]   to fund a for-profit entity.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.820]   Other nonprofits have done it,
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.100]   particularly when you need to attract billions of dollars
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.780]   of outside capital to make it work.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.300]   The real question is does the nonprofit
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.540]   still do nonprofit stuff?
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.560]   - That's an interesting question because,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.780]   Freiburg, do you think that when they booted off
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.020]   the nonprofit experts from the board,
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.860]   that they may have crossed a trip wire there?
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.700]   - Yes.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.540]   - Yeah, I'm the lawyer.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.360]   I'm the lawyer.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.200]   That's a great question.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.100]   - I did a little journalism,
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.140]   and I talked to a couple of people who are in and around
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.420]   two other of these scenarios.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.180]   One of the key issues here is that the IP,
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.020]   in your example, Freiburg,
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.380]   it wasn't like that cystic fibrosis organization
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.860]   did the drug discovery, right?
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.740]   They didn't do it, correct?
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.580]   Well, they funded it.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.720]   - I think they handed over some research
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.300]   that was open to the public at the time,
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.180]   but they funded an independent for-profit.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.220]   - And so what happened here was you had the IP
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.680]   and the employees of the nonprofit gifted,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.460]   they were transferred over to the for-profit organization.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.260]   And when the Mozilla Foundation did this
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.900]   and another company called Samasource,
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.060]   and these both have two structures,
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.720]   a nonprofit and a for-profit,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.940]   but in both of their cases, they set up separate boards.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.860]   And the two different boards,
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.740]   the answer to the for-profit concerns
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.120]   and the nonprofit concerns,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.060]   they also didn't give huge chunks of equity
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.180]   to all of the employees, which then sold them in secondary.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.220]   So what's happened here is all of the IP in all likelihood
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.940]   has been, and the wealth transfer
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.660]   has gone to all these employees.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.440]   They've now done the secondary.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.140]   And this actually triggers a lot of IRS investigations.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.060]   The Mozilla Foundation, which was making the Netscape
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.700]   browser, which many of you probably have used
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.820]   for the years, they were making hundreds of millions
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.780]   of dollars a year, David, from advertising with Google.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.900]   The IRS said, "Hey, wait a second,
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.700]   "you look like a for-profit to us."
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.060]   So they made a for-profit entity.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.740]   All of the, and Mitchell Baker and the team over there
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.700]   set this up so all the money went back
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.460]   into the Mozilla Foundation in their nonprofit efforts.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.540]   And they just paid above market salaries.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.160]   But it was very important that these things be separated
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.780]   and that the employees not have equity
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.580]   and that all that money flowed back up.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.700]   And I think this is where OpenAI
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.320]   is gonna get super tripped up.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.780]   And I think the IRS is gonna have a field day here.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.820]   - Here's the, Nick, can you please throw the image up?
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.380]   This is from the OpenAI website
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.140]   that explains their structure.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.520]   So let's just speculate for a second
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.940]   'cause we're just guessing.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.940]   But it has been reported that Microsoft owns 49%, right?
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.480]   That's the number?
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.180]   - Of the for-profit.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.280]   In this example, Microsoft, where it says minority
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.000]   economic interest, that number there would be 49
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.400]   and that's what they own of this OpenAI Global LLC.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.040]   And the majority owner is this holding company.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.660]   Okay, so that means 51% is there.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.400]   But it says here that that 51% is owned
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.180]   by a combination of the nonprofit,
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.540]   employees and investors.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.220]   So the question is, back to Sax's question,
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.880]   we can know very precisely how much the nonprofit owns
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.900]   by just Xing out the investors and employees.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   And I'm gonna guess it's at least 30 or 40%.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.700]   I think that that's probably a pretty reasonable guess.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.720]   So it means that the OpenAI Foundation
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.940]   probably owns somewhere between five to 20%.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.420]   Is that fairly reasonable guess at the maximum?
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.220]   - That seems right, yeah.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.720]   And so I think that they're gonna have to show
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   that ownership structure and decompose all these entities
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.860]   and show the actual percentages.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.180]   If it's a lot less than that, if it's say like a 1% thing,
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.220]   then it's a little bit more sketch, I think.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.480]   But if it's really like 15 or 20%,
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.960]   they're still gonna have to prove that all of this was done
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.940]   in a clean way because the big thing that these guys did
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.460]   was because by creating this LPGP structure
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.660]   and these cap profits,
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.300]   it's clear that they were trying to avoid something.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.980]   And the question is in the discovery,
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.540]   will everybody learn what it is
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.660]   that they were trying to avoid?
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.500]   Because I've been through this,
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.780]   I think Sax, you've been through it,
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.220]   Freeburg, you were through it.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.420]   When you set up these large vehicles
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.100]   and pooled amounts of money,
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.340]   folks come out of the woodwork
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.380]   with all kinds of convoluted structures.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.580]   And the discipline is always to tell these lawyers
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.760]   and accountants, no.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.740]   And they'll be like, let's set up a master feeder
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.980]   and you'll go through Bermuda and this and that.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.860]   And it's so easy to say yes because it's very seductive
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.380]   what they're selling you,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.320]   but it's always about trying to avoid something.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.480]   So the real question is why this convoluted structure,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.260]   what was it trying to avoid?
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.700]   - And where did this IP come from?
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.900]   Like all that IP, Sax, came from a nonprofit.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.260]   All those employees worked for the nonprofit.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.380]   Then they decided to go from an open source model to closed.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.940]   And then by doing that, they capture all the value
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.760]   and then it's gifted to these employees
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.860]   and this investor base.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.380]   That's where I think something doesn't seem right.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   - Well, it's important to remember
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.220]   the majority of the IP that exists at OpenAI today
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.660]   was generated after the for-profit was set up.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.340]   The real question, was there a fair transfer at the time
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.680]   when it was set up of value into this for-profit entity?
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.800]   And my guess is that GP box that you just looked at,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.460]   the compensation that they're earning through that GP box
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.080]   that the nonprofit earns,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.100]   is likely meant to be kind of a fair amount
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.280]   relative to what was contributed at the time.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.420]   The real question for me still remains,
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.480]   what other nonprofit and charitable work
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.740]   does the OpenAI 501(c)(3) actually do?
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.600]   And if the answer is nothing
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.000]   and it's just a shell nonprofit
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.560]   and under it the only thing that it owns
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.340]   is a for-profit interest,
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.820]   then I think there's a real question on what's the activity.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.900]   And I don't mean to speak out of turn on all this stuff.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.760]   I don't know enough,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.340]   but I think that's the only sort of lens
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.940]   I would kind of look at this stuff through.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.100]   - Sax, you wanna say something?
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.200]   - Well, a couple of points.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.220]   One is, one of my contentions has been
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.060]   never innovate on structure.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.960]   All you do is create legal problems.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.160]   There's a tried and true way of creating a startup,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.860]   which is a C corp.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.060]   When you try to innovate on legal instead of product,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.560]   it almost always backfires.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.180]   The second point here is,
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.620]   I think OpenAI is in a little bit of a
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.220]   damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.500]   To go back to Freeberg's point about the nonprofits
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.000]   sitting at the top there,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.980]   remember what created all the problems
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.560]   when Sam briefly got fired as CEO and then came back,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.340]   is they had these directors from the nonprofit world
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.140]   who didn't really seem to understand how startups work.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.260]   And so either they fired Sam for no reason,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.620]   which was kind of incompetent,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.220]   or they had a really good reason
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.920]   but didn't communicate it properly,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.340]   which was also incompetent.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.740]   Either way, that whole thing was a spectacle.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.180]   And it just kind of showed
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.580]   that there was this culture clash going on
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.140]   between the for-profit company
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.220]   and the standard way of running
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.900]   a Silicon Valley startup to maximize the outcome,
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.460]   and then this nonprofit board
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.560]   that was sitting on top of the whole thing.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.900]   So I think that now they're in the situation
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.680]   where they've changed that nonprofit board,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.160]   they've booted off the nonprofit people,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.140]   and that may have been the right thing
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.260]   for the for-profit entity,
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.100]   but now it might get them in trouble
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.900]   because it lends credence to Elon's lawsuit
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.240]   that they've completely changed the original mission
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.760]   of this organization.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.100]   Right, it was supposed to be-- - Yeah, and the mission.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.220]   - It was supposed to be open source,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.700]   and it was supposed to be nonprofit,
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.580]   and now it's for-profit and closed source.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.140]   - Think about this, and again,
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.500]   we are speculating here,
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.880]   but if the mission was to be open source,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.720]   and then you realize you've got something super valuable,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.740]   and you close source it, create a for-profit,
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.380]   and then take all the employees and all the IP
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.940]   and put it into the for-profit, lock it down,
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.220]   break the original mission that,
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.920]   hey, this was gonna help humanity
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.600]   because we're gonna make it open source.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.560]   So if you donate money here and we get the tax exemption,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.020]   humanity benefits because everybody gets
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.600]   to look at that code at the same time
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.400]   and work on it and iterate.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   Now they've just basically stolen all that
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.820]   in order to enrich themselves.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.280]   And I think then you add to it,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.360]   Sam maybe doing some deal-making,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.660]   which seems to be one of the triggers according to reports,
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.480]   and this OpenAI Venture Fund, et cetera,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.520]   maybe that deal-making made the nonprofit people say,
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.940]   hey, listen, you're doing even more for-profit stuff
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.360]   with the OpenAI name.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.900]   We're supposed to be a nonprofit here.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.260]   - What's the venture fund thing?
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.740]   - He started a venture fund to invest in companies
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.580]   called the OpenAI Ventures Fund,
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.540]   and he was the sole owner of it,
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.800]   which they're saying now it's a clerical mistake
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.720]   or something, but he's invested in a bunch of startups
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.200]   that have unique access to the OpenAI,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.880]   you know, I think infrastructure.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.500]   - He's the GP on behalf of OpenAI.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.780]   - Yes, the OpenAI.fund, yes.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.820]   - No, but he's the GP on behalf of himself
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.160]   or on behalf of OpenAI.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.480]   - The way the paperwork was done,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.720]   it was on behalf of himself.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.640]   They're now saying that that was done in error.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.880]   So, okay, fine, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, who knows?
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.080]   - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, the OpenAI fund,
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.820]   yes.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.100]   - Whose money is that?
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.620]   - Sam raised the money to create an OpenAI fund
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.160]   to invest in companies using OpenAI software.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.820]   - Okay, so that's a different kind of issue.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.060]   That's called a corporate opportunity issue
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.140]   where OpenAI's fund-- - Self-dealing, self-dealing.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.700]   - It's basically a conflict of interest
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.180]   where the economic opportunity
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.580]   of the OpenAI Startup Fund should belong to OpenAI
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.080]   if Sam created a separate fund with separate LPs
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.760]   that he's the GP of and gets economics in that,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.380]   then that's a potential usurpation
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.640]   of a corporate opportunity.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.760]   I don't know the truth of that matter.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.520]   I'm just saying that's a slightly different issue.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.900]   To go back to the point-- - And it uses the OpenAI name.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.400]   - Yeah, that's where the corporate opportunity
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.760]   becomes really explicit.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.200]   To go back to the point you were making a minute ago
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.240]   about the employees, I just think,
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.580]   I mean, you used the word stealing.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.080]   I think that's a really strong word.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.940]   I mean, I think we have to complement the employees
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.780]   of this company, if it is a company,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.480]   including Sam, including Greg, including Ilya,
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.460]   for creating an amazing product, right?
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.300]   - Something incredible.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.140]   - They've created something incredible.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.960]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.860]   - And they've created, I think, an amazing ecosystem,
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.160]   and there's a lot of developers building on top of this,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.660]   and I think no one is attacking their work.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.280]   And I think it's a little too harsh to say
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.300]   that anyone's stealing anything
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.480]   'cause they have created all the value.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.820]   The question, and I think you have to include Sam in that
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.740]   and say that he's done a great job, okay, as CEO,
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.260]   because they've built something amazing.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.400]   - And, Sax, to your point, it's not stealing
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.100]   because very smart investors
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.740]   are putting in money eyes wide open.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.160]   - Yeah, I think that the criticism here
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.820]   is related to structure, from my standpoint.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.260]   It's related to structure,
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.620]   and whether Elon was told something at the beginning
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.700]   that's different, it got changed,
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.440]   and clearly it got changed in a way
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.240]   that was not consistent with the terms
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.560]   under which he initially contributed all this money.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.220]   - Yeah, mine is, I'm stating what is
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.820]   the most cynical interpretation of what happened here.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   There is the most benign and benevolent interpretation
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.660]   you could have as well,
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.540]   and maybe the truth is in between the two,
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.780]   but the series of events that occurred
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.840]   does not look good when you have a mission
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.300]   to give this intellectual property to the world.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.540]   So, no one person benefits from it.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.640]   All of humanity is supposed to benefit from it.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.120]   That was the point of being open source.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.720]   - Right. - Then you close it.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.940]   Now, who gets the benefit if it's closed?
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.980]   - Right, that's a good point. - The employees.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.800]   - Right, that's a good point.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   - And that's gonna be the crux of this,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.800]   and if you really wanna-- - Or the investors.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.200]   The investors. - The investors.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.220]   - But that's how they were able
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.500]   to attract billions of dollars,
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.640]   'cause you can't get billions of dollars
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   to invest in something that's gonna be open sourced,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.720]   and there's no return. - And then the employees
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.460]   sell two billion in secondary.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.000]   So now you, if you really wanna take
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.300]   the most cynical approach to this or interpretation,
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.840]   and again, this is just one interpretation,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.320]   they took an open source project, they closed it,
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.520]   they raised money, and then within the next two years
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.500]   on this incredible innovation,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.720]   they sold $2 billion and put that in their pockets.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.220]   Now, those employees, if it was a for-profit,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.280]   obviously no problem with that,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.540]   but they took the stated mission
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.500]   of giving this to all of humanity,
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.760]   and then took 3% or 4% of that gain
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   and put it in their pockets.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.240]   That's where I think this whole thing
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.120]   is gonna get really crazy,
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.060]   and this is where the IRS-- - I think that's a good point.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.080]   - Yeah, and the IRS also interpreted Mozilla,
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.680]   which was just $100 million,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.640]   and none of the employees took any of it.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.100]   The 100 million that came out of Mozilla,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.940]   they were just saying,
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.720]   "I think you should pay tax on that.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.780]   "Should you pay tax on that?"
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.940]   And then they were investigated for years.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.900]   So I think the IRS is gonna be on this like crazy
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.360]   based upon what happened to Mozilla, which was--
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.020]   - Jason, do you think individual employee sellers
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.400]   are gonna get audited by the IRS because of this?
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.380]   - I don't, I mean, we're in uncharted territory here.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.720]   When I did some tweets and said,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.800]   "Hey, can everybody contact me
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.780]   "who has information on these structures?"
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.520]   I was able to find the Samasource example,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.080]   and they did it very clean,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.760]   and there was no IP transfer
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.440]   or employees enriching themselves,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.480]   or a God King like Sam doing all kinds of deals
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   and enriching himself.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.500]   It was a very clean structure.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.200]   And then Mitchell Baker who set up Mozilla
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.220]   also did the same thing.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.240]   Hey, we'll just pay the employees an extra 50K
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.560]   on their salaries,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.260]   and they'll be a little overpaid in Silicon Valley,
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.920]   but they're not getting billions of dollars in equity,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.580]   which again, I have no problem
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.760]   with people getting billions of dollars in equity
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.860]   in a for-profit,
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.940]   but this was supposed to benefit humanity.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.960]   It was supposed to be open.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.520]   If this was open source and they took the two billion,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.280]   I would actually not have much of a problem with it
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.960]   because we could all be looking at that mission
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.000]   and then Saks and myself and Friedberg
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.840]   and anybody who wanted to use that code
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.680]   could go in there and adapt it.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.520]   And you know what?
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.640]   There are for-profits, Apple and Meta,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.640]   which are producing open source software.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.080]   So if they're producing, Apple's pretty competent
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.860]   and Meta's super competent in this respect.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.520]   They're able to do open source,
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.340]   but Sam is claiming or OpenAI is claiming
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.480]   it's too dangerous to show us the open source code.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.320]   I call bull (beep) on that.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.720]   Their code is not too dangerous for us to sit.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.120]   That's complete utter bull (beep)
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.200]   - So you think that there is a motivation
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.220]   for profit, basically.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.640]   What you're saying is essentially
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.140]   that this was highly motivated by profit.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.120]   - I think. - Versus like even,
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.240]   like some of the emails,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.480]   the emails try to paint a picture
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.400]   of very industrious people on both sides
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.840]   who are trying to solve a very hard problem
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.300]   and dealing with a conundrum
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.700]   that's really around capital, right?
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.540]   - Yeah.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.740]   - We need to do all this training,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.520]   it's gonna be so expensive.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.500]   But I think what you're saying,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.420]   which is a deviation from that,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.380]   is actually, come on guys,
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.920]   these are all very smart people
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.560]   and those folks saw an opportunity
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.300]   to make a ton of money and they took it.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.120]   - I mean, that seems like what happened here to me.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.420]   I mean, it's Occam's Razor kind of situation.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.700]   I think they, if you look at it,
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.340]   I think they probably regretted making this a nonprofit
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.200]   and then tried to figure out a way to reverse it.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.920]   That's actually what I think is going on here.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.880]   And I do think there is part of it, Chamath, you're right,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.820]   that they needed servers and they needed capacity,
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.560]   but they could have done that
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.440]   without giving the employees tons of equity,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.020]   without selling billions of dollars,
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.460]   keeping it open source and then telling Microsoft,
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.140]   hey, if you want access to this open source or whatever,
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.580]   and they could give them-
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.660]   - You're making a very, very good point.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.420]   And the reason is that if it was open source,
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   Microsoft could have just taken it
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.100]   and done its own training and just paid for it.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.060]   - Yeah.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.060]   - Or make a donation to the foundation.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.000]   - This is interesting 'cause-
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.840]   - It's a very good point, Jacob.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.080]   - Because OpenAI, yeah, OpenAI dropped a few of the emails
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.200]   that they had with Elon.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.460]   Obviously, those are cherry picked
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.180]   to help their case the most.
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.960]   What we don't know is what are the other emails show?
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.320]   Like, what were their alternatives
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.740]   to this particular structure?
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.040]   Could they have raised the necessary funds
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.620]   in a way that was more consistent
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.480]   with the original mission of the company?
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.000]   Could they have remained open source, for example?
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.740]   Also, are there any emails where employees talk
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.900]   about the potential benefit to them of going-
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.740]   - Private.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.260]   - Going for profit, right?
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.940]   - Those emails have already been leaked.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.860]   There was this thing where,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.020]   in the OpenAI emails that were leaked,
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.700]   they talked about being able to swap this phantom equity
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.100]   in OpenAI into either YC equity,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.140]   and then Elon said, "Oh, maybe SpaceX too,
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.540]   "but I'll have to figure that out."
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.700]   - Well, then also like Microsoft coming in and buying 49%,
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.540]   and then it's closed.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.700]   This is the other piece that I would wanna see
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.580]   in discovery as well.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.900]   And again, I don't have any problem with any of the people.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.740]   I love Sam Allman, I think he's great.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   I think all the people there are great.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.700]   I think what they've done for humanity is great.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.640]   I just think they should have kept this thing open source,
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.060]   which was the mission.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.900]   But then they closed source at Chamath,
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.460]   and then give 49% of it, all the weights,
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.900]   all the source code to Microsoft.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.420]   So that, to me, was like a really...
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.560]   Like, you wanna talk about taking this nonprofit's IP,
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.040]   and then some amount of that bag
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.900]   gets given to the employees for billions of dollars,
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.340]   and then Microsoft gets 49% of all that nonprofit's effort
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.900]   to then go commercialize,
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.240]   and Microsoft has added, what, $500 billion in market cap
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.880]   since this whole thing has been announced?
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.680]   So now all that profit has been aggregated
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.940]   into Microsoft stock.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.860]   - And I think this is where you gotta understand
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.840]   why Elon feels swindled, is because not only are we going
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.820]   from nonprofit to for-profit and open source
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.060]   to closed source, he was specifically concerned
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.160]   about all the benefits of AI crewing
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.400]   to one powerful, big tech company.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   Now, at that time, he thought it was Google.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.700]   Now it's Microsoft.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.580]   There's not really that much of a difference.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.740]   He never wanted all the benefits of AI
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.780]   in the hands of one really powerful tech company.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.520]   And Microsoft is the most, it's now, what,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.300]   the biggest company in the world by market cap?
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.620]   So this is like the opposite of what he intended.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.800]   - They gifted a trillion dollars to Microsoft, probably.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.420]   There's an easy solution.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.460]   If they are people of good faith and they're doing this
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.160]   for the right reasons, open source it.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.020]   Just go back and open source it.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.620]   - Jason, but to your earlier point,
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.300]   that may solve the lawsuit, and Elon may drop the lawsuit,
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.800]   but it's opened a can of worms with respect to tax
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.820]   and structuring that's much bigger than just open AI.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.660]   - Yeah, I don't think it solves that.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.820]   - It's the entire nonprofit industry.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.300]   It's a tax problem for every new company.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.700]   It's every other entrepreneur that studies this model
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.380]   and tries to replicate it for their own personal gain,
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.760]   even if that wasn't intentional here.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.240]   So there's a whole set of issues
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.560]   that we've really cracked the egg here.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.600]   We gotta figure out how to unscramble it.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.340]   - There's the IRS issues, then there's what's morally right,
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.540]   and then there's Elon's beef.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.180]   And if it is a for-profit company and Elon put in 50 million
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.900]   when it was a seed round, what would he own, Sachs?
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.540]   What would his ownership in this for-profit be?
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.300]   - Oh my God, I mean, probably--
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.820]   - 98%.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.260]   - Okay, and so--
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.360]   - Yeah, we need to know the total size of that round.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.580]   He put in the first 40 million.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.240]   Do we know what other people put in?
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.640]   It was most of the money, right?
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.480]   - Yeah, it was most of the money.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.860]   So, I mean, if you put,
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.220]   let's just put a crazy valuation on it, 500 million.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.620]   Okay, he owns whatever, 10%--
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.460]   - No, no, at that point, it would,
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.060]   AI was not what it is today.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.900]   - Of course not.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.060]   - So you would've raised that like,
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.980]   you would've raised 150 on 50 pre.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.220]   - Okay.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.540]   - That's the way that a very capex-intensive deal
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.860]   in a space that wasn't thought to yield big outcomes,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.700]   that's unfortunately the cost of capital.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.900]   - Elon would own half the company, at least.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.740]   - At least.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.060]   - All right, so give him 20% of the company,
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.120]   it's $20 billion since even half
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.260]   of what you're saying, Zach, right?
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.180]   - We talked about on the show when that whole fracas
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.060]   with these non-profit directors went down,
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.660]   is we said, go back and restructure the whole thing
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.620]   to make it what it always should've been,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.060]   which is just a clean for-profit entity,
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.180]   give Elon his equity, give Sam his equity,
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.900]   'cause it never made sense that Sam had no equity either.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.120]   - Sam has no equity, but he's got a venture firm,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.160]   it's all so convoluted.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.980]   - It's a weird form of compensation in which
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.440]   they're giving him corporate opportunities
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.800]   in effect as like a type of compensation,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.720]   when really he should just have compensation
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.420]   in the corporation, and then the corporation
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.680]   should own all of its opportunities.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.700]   - Okay, that's a really interesting thing you just said.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.560]   So basically, yeah, it's like he famously has no equity,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.800]   but then he has this retained optionality
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.440]   to monetize the ecosystem.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.720]   So even though he's not monetizing the thing,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.400]   he gets to monetize everything around him.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.980]   - And it seems like the board,
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.580]   or at least the new board's okay with that,
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.860]   because he is being undercompensated
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.440]   with respect to the main thing.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.820]   So then he gets the side things,
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.280]   but that's not really the way it should work either.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.940]   - You know, Bill Gates said to us famously
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.280]   when we were at, when I was at Facebook,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.620]   the value of an ecosystem is when the economic value
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.820]   generated by the ecosystem exceeds that of the platform.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.340]   Now, in this case, you'd actually rather have
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.580]   50 basis points of the ecosystem than 5% of open AI,
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.900]   if that's true, 'cause if this thing
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.340]   could be so revolutionary, you're talking
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.060]   10, 20, 30 trillion dollars.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.460]   - What a mess, oy oy oy.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.380]   - Sam should just be given like a huge option grant
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.900]   in open AI, but then open AI should own
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.000]   its own venture fund.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.020]   - Yeah, and the SEC is looking into all this stuff.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.860]   You know, they look into a lot of things in fairness,
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.700]   but they're looking into it, what a mess,
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.420]   and we'll keep track of it.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.580]   The other thing that's crazy, I don't know
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.960]   if you guys know this, but Nick, just as we close here,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.660]   the most insane part of open AI's LP investment agreement,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.980]   which is on their website, you can just search
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.180]   for open AI LP agreement, is this part.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.740]   The partnership exists to advance open AI Inc.'s mission
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.900]   of ensuring that safe artificial and general intentions
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.860]   is deployed and benefits all of humanity.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.780]   The general partners' duty to this mission
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.900]   and principles advance in open AI's ink chart,
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.220]   yada yada yada, take precedent over the obligation
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.980]   to generate a profit.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.180]   The partnership may never make a profit
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.940]   and the general partner is under no obligation to do so.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.300]   The general partner is free to reinvest any
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.660]   and all of the operating entities' cash flow
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.200]   into research and development activities
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.760]   and/or related expenses without any obligation
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.140]   to the limited partners.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.140]   And so they basically told everybody,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.640]   Vinod and employees or whatever,
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.220]   we can just basically wipe your equity out
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.020]   and we can do whatever we want with the profits
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.380]   and you're probably gonna lose your money.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.340]   So this structure is weird.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.580]   - Do you guys think that when the investors came in,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.100]   especially in this latest round,
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.560]   the $86 billion round,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.300]   do you think they underwrote the legal risk
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.920]   inherent in the structure?
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.500]   Or are they just sort of hand-waved over it and said--
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   - No, typically what happens in these deals
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   is you hire somebody like KPMG or Deloitte
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.820]   or Ernst & Young to do the full financial diligence packet.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.980]   And that typically tends to be how a lot
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:43.080]   of late-stage organizations document that they've done
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.240]   and manage their fiduciary responsibilities
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.060]   on behalf of their limited partners.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.160]   So what happens is you will do a deal,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.120]   you'll sign a term sheet, you'll turn it over to Deloitte,
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.500]   you'll turn it over to KPMG and say,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.740]   "Please go and run this down."
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.740]   And then what they do is they will furnish a report
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.960]   that says, "Yes, this meets all the customary expectations."
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   I suspect that if these folks were doing a decent job
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.920]   of running late-stage money,
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.380]   they probably sent it to those folks.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.420]   And those folks probably produced something
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.820]   that said, "This looks fine."
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.380]   Now, if you read Buffett's letter this year,
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.760]   he has a really great commentary on Deloitte and KPMG
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.740]   and these sorts of letters,
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.360]   which is not exactly the most supportive
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.400]   is the best way to say it.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.380]   Nick, you can find that mentioned.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.000]   In his case, it's Deloitte and Touche.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.360]   But typically, SACS, that's what they do.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.660]   They go to a KPMG or a Deloitte or a Ernst & Young and say...
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.900]   And by the way, 99% of the time,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.360]   I mean, they do really good work,
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.220]   but it's a standard structure.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.160]   And they just wanna make sure
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.760]   that nothing nefarious is a muck.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.160]   In this case, I doubt anything was a muck anyways.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.660]   I doubt though that they looked at the structure
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.660]   and then also elevated the litigation risk
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.800]   of this getting unwound.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.240]   I just don't see that that diligence report,
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.640]   and I've seen enough of them,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.840]   typically has that section in it.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.660]   - The other thing that's completely hypocritical here
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.080]   is they said when they hit AGI
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.520]   and they're gonna be like a sentient,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.060]   artificial intelligent going on here,
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.400]   Friedberg, that they would wrap up shop
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.760]   and they're gonna no longer be a nonprofit, et cetera.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.200]   But they're claiming they haven't hit that,
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.960]   but they closed the software.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.560]   So it should be open source if they haven't hit AGI
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.320]   and you don't think they've hit general intelligence, right?
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.600]   Friedberg, for anything close to it.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.080]   Maybe you could educate the audience on what that is
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.840]   and that claim that they have to-
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.680]   - No, I don't think they have. - Should have shut off
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.840]   the for-profit.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.800]   Yeah, they haven't.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.400]   - But I think we keep repeating this concept
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.000]   of the models should be open source versus closed source.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Making AI for the benefit of humanity
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.020]   can be interpreted in a lot of ways.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.240]   There may have been some anecdotal conversation
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.620]   at some point with Elon or others
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.020]   about we're gonna make the models open source.
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.140]   But there was a reason that that change was made
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.040]   along the way, which was to attract dollars.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   And those dollars need to have some return of capital
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.720]   available to them because they're private investor dollars.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.880]   And so I don't think that that was necessarily,
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.720]   and correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.020]   I don't think that's in the mission,
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.280]   that the open AI software models will be open source.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.920]   Making AI for the benefit of humanity
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.040]   could probably be interpreted in a lot of different ways
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.400]   and we'll see.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.800]   But no, I don't think that anyone has achieved
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   this holy grail of general intelligence.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.840]   - Yeah.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.360]   - I think one of the more interesting
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.320]   and kind of wacky things about open AI
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.800]   is that their mission is explicitly to create EGI,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.280]   which most people would associate
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.480]   with some sort of sci-fi dystopian outcome.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   And I think this has raised the fear factor around AI
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.500]   because they're explicitly trying to create
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.820]   the sentence that's gonna replace humanity.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.240]   Now, I think they defined AGI in a different way.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.960]   They say it's something that can replace 80% of the jobs,
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.980]   but I think we all kind of know what it really is.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.240]   So I just wonder if--
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.780]   - I don't know, I think that that's like,
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.920]   that assumes a steady state in the world.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.880]   So if you end up with a system
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.020]   and the system has all the capabilities
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.560]   of a bunch of really highly qualified knowledge workers,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.200]   and I can sit in front of a computer terminal
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.800]   and I can say, "Let's design a mission to Mars."
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.120]   A mission to Mars could be a 20-year engineering project
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.520]   with hundreds of people involved to design the buildings,
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.840]   to design the flight path, to figure out the fuel needs,
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.920]   to figure out how you would then be able to terraform Mars.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.680]   And what if one person could interact with a computer
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.960]   and design a plan to go and inhabit Mars?
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.400]   All of the technical detail docs could be produced,
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.260]   all of the engineering specifications could be generated,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.620]   all of the operating plans, all of the dates,
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.820]   the amount of labor needed,
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.860]   the amount of production needed,
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.220]   the amount of capital needed.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.900]   What would otherwise take NASA or some international
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.620]   or well-funded private company many, many decades to do,
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.260]   a piece of software could do in a very short order.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.140]   I think that's like a really,
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   like for me, poignant example of the potential
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.860]   of having these tools broadly available,
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.660]   that the potential of humanity
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.060]   starts to become much broader.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.820]   We could say, I want to develop a city underneath the ocean
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.680]   because I want to explore more of the earth.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.840]   I think humans need to go solve cancer,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.200]   figure out the biologic drugs
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.600]   and the combination of biologic drugs
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.120]   that would be needed to solve cancer
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.940]   based on this patient's genotype.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.320]   The extensibility of highly knowledgeable
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.380]   or what other people might call
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.100]   general intelligence type tooling is extraordinary.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.980]   That one individual starts to have an entire cohort
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.580]   of knowledge workers available at their disposal
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.580]   to do things that we can't even imagine today.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.140]   So I don't think that it is nefarious.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.400]   It's nefarious because we assume
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.640]   a steady state of the world today, that nothing changes.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.280]   Therefore, a piece of software replaces all of us.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.360]   But the potential of humanity starts to stretch
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.200]   into a new era that we're not really comfortable with
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.440]   because we don't really know it or understand it yet.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.960]   - I'm not saying it's nefarious to want to develop AI
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.720]   because I agree with you
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.940]   about all the extraordinary potential of it.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.040]   I'm saying there's something a little bit cultish
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.200]   and weird about explicitly devoting yourself to AGI,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.340]   which I think in common parlance means Skynet.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.740]   - Yeah, it means something sentient smarter than humans.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.160]   - Maybe that parlance is what needs to be addressed,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.200]   which is AGI effectively enables equivalence
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.300]   to a human knowledge worker.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.640]   And that can kind of unleash a new kind of
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.480]   set of opportunities.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.640]   - So you think that's what it is?
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.620]   - My definition for AGI is smarter
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.540]   than the smartest human being who ever lived.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.880]   - Yeah, I was talking to somebody this week
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.000]   who's in a position who said the definition of AGI
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.020]   is very fuzzy, that there isn't a clear definition.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.240]   And therefore, it allows every side to kind of anchor
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.000]   on their interpretation of what that term means
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.280]   and therefore kind of justifies their position.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.800]   So I don't really feel great about like just saying,
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.180]   are we at AGI?
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.080]   We don't have a clear sense of what it means.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.500]   I do think if you look at some of the work that was done
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.660]   by Anthropic and published in the Cloud3 model this week,
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.600]   did any of you guys see the demos that were done
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.960]   of the output of that model?
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.240]   There was a guy who wrote a thesis in quantum physics
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.820]   on a very esoteric, complicated problem set.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.500]   And he asked Cloud3 to solve this problem set
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.480]   and it came up with his thesis.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.880]   It was really like extraordinary.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.820]   And this is something he's like,
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.180]   no one in the world knows this stuff.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.380]   And he's like, I can't believe this model
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.840]   like came up with my thesis.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.280]   And that's the sort of thing that very few people on earth
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.020]   even read or understand.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.760]   And the Cloud3 model was able to kind of recreate
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.360]   the basis, the buildup and then the output of his thesis
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.200]   was really extraordinary.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.280]   - It'd be like somebody writing a screenplay
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.800]   and then giving it the first two acts
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.840]   and say, guess the third act.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.320]   And it's like, oh yeah, this is the third act,
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.480]   here's what happens.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.680]   Like it's pretty impressive, the reasoning ability.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.520]   - Yeah, complicated.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.900]   - Let me ask you, like deep down,
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.260]   when these guys say they're gonna create AGI,
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.460]   what do you think they really mean
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.180]   in their heart of hearts?
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.320]   - Oh, they mean the Terminator.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.480]   Yeah, they mean the sentient God.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.080]   - You guys are propagating some bad (beep)
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.400]   you guys shouldn't be saying that.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.560]   - I think that's what they think.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.760]   - Remember what Larry Page said to Elon,
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.600]   don't be speciesist.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.440]   - Yeah.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.000]   - I think there's a meaningful number of people
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.920]   in the tech community who deliberately wanna give rise
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.000]   to the super intelligence.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.760]   - There's another point of view of super intelligence
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.640]   where super intelligence means that the software
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.860]   is now more intelligent than all humans.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.680]   And as a result, the software may have its own motivations
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.320]   to figure out how to supersede humans on earth.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.840]   Now, the Larry Page statement,
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.600]   which I don't know firsthand,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.540]   I read the same article you did,
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.880]   is one that a group of people might say,
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.260]   evolution is evolution.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.280]   You know, there are people-
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.400]   - Yeah, they would say that.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.380]   - That's right.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.200]   And I know Elon's taking this point of view
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.720]   that like, you know, we need to maintain human supremacy,
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.560]   but my favorite test is, you know,
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.520]   there's the Turing test,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.400]   which like you can't tell if it's a human
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.720]   or if it's a robot,
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.120]   but Mustafa came up with the modern Turing test,
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.600]   which is an AI model is given $100,000
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.520]   and has to obtain 1 million, go.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.360]   - Kind of interesting.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.760]   - That's a good idea.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.040]   - The other interesting one was Gary Marcus.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.680]   He said the IKEA test, the flat pack furniture test,
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.840]   and AI views the parts
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.120]   and instructions of an IKEA flat pack product
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.480]   that controls a robot to assemble the furniture correctly.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.680]   - Oh, look, what's up, Sonny?
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.440]   It's now time to do just a quick little congratulations
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.760]   to our dear friend, Sandeep Madra.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.660]   We call him Sonny, that's his nickname.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.960]   And he's one of our poker buddies.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.980]   He keeps building great companies.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.760]   And in this case,
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.360]   Sandeep is the first person to collect all four besties.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.900]   We all invested in his company, Definitive.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.000]   And Definitive was working in AI,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.640]   but we got some great news this week
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   and we thought we would give him his flowers.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.660]   Sonny, you want to tell us what happened this week
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.180]   with our investment in your company,
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.840]   Definitive Intelligence at definitive.io,
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.340]   I believe is your domain.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.420]   - Yeah, well, you know, with your guys' support
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.500]   and, you know, we've been growing our company
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.660]   and we saw a really great opportunity
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.900]   to work together with Grok
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.880]   and we've been working with them for a couple of months
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.920]   and all the hype that you've seen has been built on
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.640]   the collaborations that we've done,
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.280]   building the cloud offering, the API offerings.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.180]   And so, you know, we've decided to merge with them
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.240]   and we're super excited.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.120]   And all the besties are now not only shareholders
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.720]   in Definitive previously, but now shareholders in Grok.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.660]   - This is the first investment, I think,
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.440]   where we're all on the cap table, right?
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.480]   So we're all rooting in the same direction.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.160]   What's happening in the developer side?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.000]   How's the momentum going?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.860]   - Well, the momentum's incredible.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.520]   You know, we have now 16,000 plus developers
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.400]   in our self-serve playground.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.800]   There's well over like a thousand apps
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.320]   that people have developed using the API
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.240]   and all kinds of new functionality.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.120]   The API allows people to get a higher rate
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.320]   of throughput on tokens and low latency.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.760]   So there's all kinds of new applications
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.240]   from voice to real-time translation of web pages.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.720]   We're collecting them on our Discord.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.360]   We have 3,000 people in the Discord as well.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.320]   It is a real community that's come together
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.240]   building around Grok.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.960]   And what I will say is sort of the same jump
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.240]   that developers saw when we went from dial-up internet
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.040]   to broadband, they're seeing that now
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.960]   and from using like traditional APIs for LLMs
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.760]   to using, you know, the ones that we offer.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.400]   - You guys support the latest and profit models
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.240]   that they just launched that seemed pretty kick-ass.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.820]   - No, we don't have those yet, but we're in just, you know,
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.000]   we're having discussions with everyone out there
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.960]   and we want to support their models.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.940]   Right now, what we've done given all the demand
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.320]   is we've kind of limited it to Llama 2, 70B and Mixtrol.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.840]   And we actually have a bunch of other models
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.080]   that we make available in private mode for folks.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.240]   We're pretty excited.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.320]   But if there's anyone out there
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.400]   that wants to have us, you know, give us a call
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.840]   and we'll get you going on our systems.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.420]   - Well, Sonny, congrats to you.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.920]   You're an incredible entrepreneur.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.020]   And it's always fun to kind of be on the journey with you.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.080]   This is my fourth business that I've done with Sonny Madra.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:27.920]   - That's amazing.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.080]   Extreme Lens. - Yeah.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.520]   - Then there was a company in between.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.500]   - No, no, no, there was a company in between.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.800]   You have to understand, Sonny and I met
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   because Sonny went to school where I grew up.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.080]   He went to the University of Ottawa.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.960]   I grew up there and we met through a mutual friend
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.200]   and his first company was called Spongefish,
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.820]   which I backed, I think in 2006 maybe.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.880]   I mean, I had no money.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.360]   I may have written a $10,000 check.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.920]   - Would you give me $8,000?
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.480]   - 10K maybe. - Maybe less.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.760]   - 10K check? - Maybe less, 5K.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.880]   Yeah, I mean, whatever I had, I didn't have much.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.440]   - I like it, scraped together.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.680]   - And it's our fourth business.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   - Sonny's a variable rabbit's foot.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.480]   You're a rabbit's foot, Sonny.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.320]   - It is true, he is.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   He's a luck bot.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.760]   - Luck prefers the prepared.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.560]   - Well, I mean, I've been in two of Sundeep's companies
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.020]   and I thank him for that.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.920]   And then Extreme Labs, actually, to thank you again.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.360]   You sponsored a lot of my events 10 years ago
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.740]   when I was coming up, so I appreciate that.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.100]   So it's just great to see a nice guy win
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.400]   as opposed to the three miserable people
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.720]   who I work with on this podcast keep winning.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.560]   So that's good.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   Now, finally, a good guy wins
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.720]   as opposed to the four of us.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.580]   - Well, I appreciate all your guys' support.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.520]   It means a lot to us, you guys getting the developers
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.360]   and keep putting it out there and keep us honest as well.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.080]   So if we're not doing something right, let us know.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.840]   Really appreciate you guys all.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.080]   - Sax, you wanna say something motivational to Sonny here?
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.380]   I know you always have a great motivational word
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.540]   for your friends, something you say that just gives people
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.460]   that thrill of being in the game.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.560]   Go ahead, Sax, you always have something kind to say.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.400]   - We're gonna ship 20 million into your safe note.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.360]   I know you closed it, but we're gonna pry it open
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.960]   and get some allocation.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.680]   - Wait a second, if you're prying open that safe,
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.800]   the safe's, if there's a wedge,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.640]   I know a guy with a podcast who's got 800,000 followers,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.360]   maybe I could slip in a quick 500,000.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.360]   Is there possible?
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.280]   What do you think, Sandeep?
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   Let us know right now.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.720]   - I don't know, we did a really big announcement
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.480]   with the Saudis this week, so that price might be up.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.340]   - So let us ship something into that safe note
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.840]   so we actually have some real skin in the game.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.960]   - David, text me.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.800]   - All right, we'll do.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.240]   - Well, no, but seriously, hey, Sandeep,
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.060]   wait a second, if he gets in--
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:26.900]   - I mean, if you're gonna let him text you--
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.400]   - I gotta get a second chip in the 500,000.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.760]   - Jason wants in for 500, by that he means $500,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.600]   so we'll let you into it.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.840]   - No, I got a gift card for you from Starbucks.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.380]   I got a $500 gift card for you and the team.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.220]   I think I got like 150,000 in the brief credits.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.040]   - Jacob's gonna redeem that Starbucks gift card.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.580]   He'll sell it for 20 cents on the dollar
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.420]   and then ship it into the--
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:45.240]   - Yeah, let me zip it in.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.360]   Let me zip it in, maybe I can 100X it.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.760]   No, seriously, 500K from your boy, Jay Cal.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.920]   All right, everybody, thanks to Sandeep for jumping on.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.040]   Congratulations on the murder.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:53.880]   - Thanks, guys.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.800]   - All right, issue two, issue two.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.080]   Apple is battling two major iOS developers
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.960]   and regulators are siding with the devs.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.520]   You may know about the Apple versus Epic Games saga.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.440]   We've talked about it here.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:10.360]   Epic Games is planning to create a custom app store on iOS
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.340]   because Europe's DMA, the Digital Markets Act,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.560]   has said that Apple now has to allow
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.120]   third-party app stores in the EU.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.080]   So Epic created a developer account based in Sweden
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.400]   and Apple actually approved the account two weeks ago.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.080]   Then on Wednesday, Apple flipped,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.800]   terminated Epic's EU developer account,
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.160]   and Apple said one of the reasons
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.100]   they terminated the account was because Epic's CEO
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.520]   publicly criticized their DMA compliance plan.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.600]   Additionally, on Monday, Apple was fined 2 billion
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.800]   by the EU's antitrust regulators
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.960]   and was forced to remove its anti-steering rules
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.920]   from music apps like Spotify.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.640]   Basically, Apple has been restricting music apps
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.600]   from informing users about pricing and discounts
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.580]   and the European Commission considered this anti-competitive
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.900]   since Apple runs Apple Music.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.660]   And they want Spotify to pay 30%.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.520]   Daniel Ek, a friend of the pod,
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.600]   basically did a whole video on this
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.520]   about how they can't charge 30% more, yada yada.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.540]   Sax, you've spoken about Apple's monopoly before.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:13.040]   Your thoughts on what's happening in the EU
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.640]   and then we'll get into Apple's wider problems.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.740]   - I mean, did you just say that Apple booted Epic
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.320]   from their app store because they didn't like
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.240]   what Epic said about them?
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.420]   I mean, talk about-- - Their feelings were hurt.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.560]   - Well, like, they're violating Epic's free speech
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.220]   because they don't like what Epic is saying.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.960]   I mean, this is-- - According to Epic, yes.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.060]   - This is crazily heavy-handed by Apple.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.040]   - Apple heavy-handed with developers, yeah.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.180]   - Have they lost their minds?
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.600]   I mean, this is right out of power corrupts
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.940]   and absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:46.320]   I mean, whatever dispute you have with Epic,
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.840]   you don't boot them out of your app store
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.740]   'cause you don't like their criticism of you.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.280]   I mean, this is basically proving
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.660]   exactly what everyone's been saying about Apple,
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.440]   which is they're too powerful and heavy-handed.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.800]   And Apple's coming along and saying,
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.380]   "Let me confirm it for you guys
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.900]   "by acting tyrannically against Epic."
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.480]   I mean, talk about a backfire.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.280]   This seems insane to me.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   - Yeah, it's super nuts.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.560]   Chamat, any thoughts on this
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.880]   before we get into Apple's other problems?
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.880]   - I think it's the beginning of the decay of Apple.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.080]   Peak Apple, well, let's get into that.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.700]   There's tons of headwinds facing Apple.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.920]   - You can add a bunch of other things
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.460]   to the list as well, Jason.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.520]   - Yeah.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.220]   - The thing is Apple for the last couple of years
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.160]   has been what is effectively
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.960]   what we call a GDP plus growth company,
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.440]   which means that take GDP, two, three, 4%.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.440]   Maybe they can grow by a couple of percentage points
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.160]   more than that, but they are effectively levered to GDP.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.260]   Meaning when you look at a Facebook or an Nvidia,
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.280]   they're growing at 50%, 200%, 2,000%,
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.920]   whatever it is, that's not tied to GDP.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.700]   They're just taking share.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.600]   But Apple is a company now that grows
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.400]   as the economy of the world grows.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.760]   So that's not super great for its future prospects
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.800]   unless it can expand the surface area of where they operate.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.680]   And then on that dimension,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.840]   there are a few trillion dollar markets
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.880]   that they can really penetrate.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.960]   And they just announced that they've killed a project
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.820]   in one of those areas, which is autos, right?
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.280]   Project Titan, which was $10 billion
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.580]   turned out to be a failure.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.260]   So all of these things I think mean to me
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.140]   that it is effectively becoming a cyclical,
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.540]   rate sensitive stock.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.880]   And then the coup de gras is Warren Buffett.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.800]   And Nick and I were talking about it this week.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.500]   And what was interesting about Buffett's letter is that
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:41.140]   you can tell when Buffett has gotten disengaged
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.860]   with a company based on the number of times
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.500]   he mentions it in his annual letter.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.060]   So in this example,
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.060]   this is the number of times Apple was mentioned.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.260]   And just to be clear, what I mean by mentions
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.780]   is not when it's included in a chart
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:54.780]   or part of a disclosure.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.340]   What I mean is when Warren actually explicitly mentions it
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.300]   in a positive or even negative way,
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.560]   or he doesn't mention it at all,
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.820]   which I think rings very loudly.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.180]   He went from basically saying,
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.500]   Apple was the absolute end all and be all.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.660]   And now what you can start to see is this shrinking.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.940]   And it's gone from basically a bunch of times
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.860]   to almost none.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.140]   He did mention it once,
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.700]   but he mentioned it in the context of talking positively
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.560]   about Coca-Cola and Amex.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.260]   And he was lauding these two positions,
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.860]   but just mentioning that they were not as large
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.860]   in comparison to Apple.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.440]   That's the only mention in this year's annual letter.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.060]   What's interesting about that is the last time
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.000]   that that happened was with, drum roll,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.840]   Wells Fargo.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.860]   Over 15 and 20 years,
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.140]   Buffett built up a huge position.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.280]   I think he was able to weather the vicissitudes
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.120]   of the market.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.780]   So even when the markets would contract,
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.120]   he knew when to hold onto that company
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.820]   until he realized that that company
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.060]   was not really one of his forever stocks.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.200]   And he got out of it.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.960]   And the number of times it basically was mentioned
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.040]   in his letter went to zero.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:07.300]   So interestingly, I think this Buffett index
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.780]   is a really important one for Apple,
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.620]   which is it went from a forever holding
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.380]   that he said he would own forever
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.800]   to barely getting mentioned.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.180]   And above Apple on that list
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.740]   were all the Japanese trading companies that Buffett owns,
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.300]   American Express, Coca-Cola.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:27.440]   So that is a person that understands the economy,
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.940]   I think, better than anybody else in the world.
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.640]   And so if you're basically taking a lever bet
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.620]   to the economy as a reason to own Apple
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.500]   and the person that understands the economy the most
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.260]   has now started to pivot away,
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.420]   he started to sell in quarter four.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.700]   And then you see all of these things,
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:47.340]   antitrust rules, killing projects in trillion dollar terms.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.360]   Unfortunately, it speaks for a very bad
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.980]   next five to 10 years for this company
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.340]   unless they figure something out.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.180]   - I think it's just such a great insight
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.100]   with the Warren Buffett mentions.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.380]   And we should do that forward looking,
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.100]   like who is he talking about now?
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.540]   And let's the monitor when he stops talking about them.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:03.900]   I have a theory about this.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.900]   I think this is really just about peak iPhone.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.700]   If you look at the majority of their revenue,
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.660]   it's obviously from the iPhone,
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.380]   which has become massively profitable over time.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.820]   But the iPhone revenue has been flat
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.540]   for a couple of years now.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.820]   And they're starting to make their money from services.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.780]   Everybody knows Apple One, iCloud storage,
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.080]   Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple Plus TV.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.060]   They've got a great collection of services
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.860]   and services revenues growing.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:33.060]   But I don't think that they are filling in
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.740]   this growth problem with the iPhone.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.380]   And this happened to me for the first time.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:37.740]   And I don't know if you gentlemen
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.660]   have had the same experience,
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.900]   but I was buying every Apple phone
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.380]   and then I would buy every like medium upgrade,
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.740]   like when they would do like a 12 and then a 12S
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.440]   or an 11, 11S.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.700]   And when I got to iPhone 13,
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.560]   I was like, this thing's kind of peaked.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.320]   And I just forgot to buy the 14, didn't need it.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.400]   And then I bought the 15
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.020]   and I'm sitting here on my 15 and my 13,
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.500]   I really couldn't tell the difference between them.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.380]   And so now I'm a technologist
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.820]   who would buy it every year, the latest one,
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.980]   and I don't feel the need to upgrade it.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.500]   And I think that a lot of people,
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.780]   and I have family members who would take two generations off,
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.620]   now they take three or four generations off.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.100]   - I don't even know what number I'm on.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.140]   - I don't even know either.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.660]   It all looks the same to me.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.940]   Okay, so I mean, that's the problem here.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.860]   And then if you look at their roadmap,
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.900]   what is the device post the Steve Jobs era
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.220]   that they have launched?
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:28.820]   How do you know what device you have?
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.060]   - You go to general in your settings and about,
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.780]   I just checked it, iPhone 13 Pro.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.380]   What version are they on?
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.220]   - 15 general.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.660]   - I'm on 15 and I'm on 13 Pro.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.500]   I don't even know.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.420]   - Yeah, and you're not price sensitive.
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.300]   And these things have gotten absurdly expensive.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.860]   So they're trying to really extract--
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.660]   - What is the latest?
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.860]   - 15.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.060]   - 15, I'm on a 14.
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.180]   - I don't like the hassle of having to reset everything
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.020]   when I get a new phone.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.020]   - Yes, and it's easy to do now.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.060]   It's all in the cloud, but even that,
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.980]   going to the store, buying it, who cares?
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.820]   It's not differential.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.980]   - But then on my apps, I have to re-log in and--
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.340]   - Frebert, what Android phone are you on?
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:06.260]   - Oh, you're a Googler.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.100]   Didn't the Googlers all have Android phones?
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.220]   Or are you your team iPhone?
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.940]   - I got the Macintosh original in 1984.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:18.820]   I've only been on Macintosh and Apple products since then.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.660]   - What iPhone are you on, be honest?
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.020]   - 15 Pro.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:22.860]   - Okay, so--
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.300]   - Have you ever tried a Pixel, Frebert?
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.460]   - I don't like it.
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.540]   But I just, I'm not used to the OS, I just--
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.660]   - What was the rule at Google?
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.300]   If you worked at Google, were you kind of forced
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.500]   to have an Android phone?
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.180]   Or did you just keep your iPhone in your pocket
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.260]   and not take out?
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.620]   - There weren't a lot of Androids on the market
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.900]   when I was at Google, because we acquired the company
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.820]   when I was there, and oh, we acquired Andy Rubin's company
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:52.820]   in '04, and I think the first major devices
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:56.340]   started to roll out in '07.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.180]   And so this was all post my era.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.340]   I left at the end of '06.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.460]   - Wow, Frebert, that's an amazing chart.
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.300]   Holy (beep)
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.300]   - Look at this chart.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.140]   Now, here's the global statistics.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:10.620]   The U.S. market share is 57% for iOS,
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.620]   but on a global basis, iOS only has a 27% market share
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.100]   in mobile operating systems.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.180]   Android is 72%, and all other is less than 1%.
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.960]   - But look at this, it's all the future GDP is on Android.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.660]   Brazil, Nigeria, India, holy mackerel.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.300]   - But I think this is one counter to your point, Chamath,
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.740]   that the macro driver is as the economic position,
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:41.000]   the GDP per capita scales in these BRICS nations,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.380]   they can start to afford to buy iPhones,
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:47.300]   which are generally some multiple of the Android devices
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.020]   in these markets that you see here.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:52.260]   So while today Android is 72% of the market,
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:55.180]   if the emerging markets continue to grow GDP per capita
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.080]   and iOS continues to be the superior product,
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.740]   you'll see Apple able to steal into more share over time.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.620]   But how do you do that when you have messaging groups
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.860]   on Android, when you have photos in Google Photos?
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.380]   Does the switching cost stop that, do you think?
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.340]   - I don't know the answer to that.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.680]   - It's a good question.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.420]   They're down to $15 to $25 for these Android phones.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.860]   In India, there's a famous-
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.880]   - That's the difference, right, to these Android devices.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.060]   - I think Apple is levered to global GDP,
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.700]   so they need to figure out some way to grow superior to that.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.020]   So what is the market?
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.300]   What could they do?
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.740]   Services?
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:36.500]   - A company that generally has a bunch of cash flow
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.300]   being generated by some set of products today,
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.040]   and you assume stasis over time,
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.260]   the market share for those products could be eaten away,
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.580]   you'll see the profits per year go down,
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.140]   and a company like that will trade anywhere
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.280]   from seven to 20 times.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.960]   The technology value arises from the value of the brand
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.080]   that you can launch new products, leverage your brand,
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.100]   leverage your distribution,
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.340]   leverage the sale of new services, and new products.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.860]   I think, to your point, Shamav,
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.580]   the challenge Apple is facing is that the pool of options,
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.700]   the portfolio of call options
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.860]   that you would get a new product coming out of Apple
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.860]   is shrinking with the car being taken out of that pool now.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.340]   Apple Vision Pro, a lot of question marks
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.700]   on how much it can scale.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.540]   As you guys know,
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.020]   I feel like there's gonna be a market for that device,
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.100]   but it's a high-end device today.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.980]   It has to become more cheap to be more ubiquitous.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.380]   - The thing that a lot of these companies confront, though,
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.720]   is that you can also grow inorganically, right?
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.580]   You don't necessarily have to incubate these projects.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.200]   We can remember the moment Apple had a chance to buy Tesla,
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.700]   right? - Didn't take it.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.240]   - Then they didn't take it.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.300]   Apple still has a chance to buy,
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.900]   pick your company that would take a sweet acquisition offer,
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.460]   Rivian, Lucid, Polestar, whatever it is.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.240]   I'm not saying that these companies are good or not good.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.480]   I'm just saying that Apple has the one tool
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.340]   that they've never used in their toolbox
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.880]   is the large inorganic acquisition.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.920]   And at this point,
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.420]   if they are proving that they can't execute internally,
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.340]   the market is going to demand that they prove
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.380]   they can use that balance sheet as a cudgel
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.460]   to go and execute it externally.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.420]   - Yeah, I think the challenge- - And if they don't do that,
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.520]   they're gonna discount that cash to zero.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.000]   - The challenge is that there's a certain discipline
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.420]   and quality to the products and the businesses
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.060]   that Apple produces and runs.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.260]   And it's very hard to see that in other markets.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.340]   I mean, why would they go buy a money-losing,
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.780]   low-margin car hardware company
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.840]   when they are proven to make high quality-
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.400]   - It depends on the reasons Project Titan failed.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.980]   - Yeah, I think-
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.940]   - The article in Bloomberg basically said
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.000]   that the reason that they abandoned the project
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.580]   was in part that they did not know
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.920]   how to go from where they were to a full production vehicle
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.040]   that could be level five.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.140]   And then when it was proposed that they step down
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.700]   and just launch a level three autonomous vehicle,
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.400]   everybody said no, that it wasn't disruptive enough.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.640]   Well, if that's the case,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.440]   the thing that they made a decision about there
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.680]   was not going into a market because of regulation,
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.240]   not because of technical capability.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.160]   And I don't think that that's necessarily a smart decision.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.040]   They would have been better off going into the car market,
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.360]   launching a level three vehicle
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.560]   and just letting the market play out.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.500]   They probably, just like they were able to do in music,
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.240]   have the influence to change the laws,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.100]   especially if they stepped in there with their rigor.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.140]   And they're not doing that.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.920]   So it's a little bit of a head scratcher
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.760]   what's going on over there.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.120]   - Yeah, they need some new products.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.420]   I mean, maybe Apple Vision Pro someday
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   becomes the platform of the future,
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.020]   but they've squeezed as much revenue
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.400]   as they can out of the iPhone.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.700]   Services seems like the best place for them to make money,
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.100]   but as we see-
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:43.940]   - Well, my idea for them was-
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.360]   - The app source under assault, yeah.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.660]   - My idea was just that they should launch a huge competitor
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.600]   to AWS, Azure and GCP.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.360]   So if you look, every developer that Apple has,
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   theoretically could have been running on an Apple,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.160]   not just on Apple's SDK and APIs,
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.780]   but they should be running in an Apple cloud.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.520]   You could have made that claim
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.680]   and it would have made a ton of sense for app developers
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.760]   to have turnkey access to that, right?
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.060]   And they could have subsidized it.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.960]   And by the way, to Sax's point,
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.460]   that would have been an incredible way
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.040]   to defend a 30% rev share.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.920]   Okay, listen, I'm taking 30%,
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.640]   but here's a bunch of subsidized access to hardware
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.660]   and the market would have loved it.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.240]   And in this AI shift, they can still do that,
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.880]   where now people are chipping away at the 30%, right?
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.120]   People are saying, "Well, I can just build around you."
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.280]   They need to do something and services, Jason,
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.360]   the most valuable thing they could do
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.640]   would be to launch a big cloud, I think.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   - Yeah, I mean, they have all the app developers
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.200]   on TestFlight ready to go.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.400]   They just email them and say, "Hey, here's your free storage."
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.080]   I mean, they could just slowly add features, right?
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.040]   And they're doing this open source,
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.800]   I think it's called Maggi or Magpie or something,
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.400]   but they're doing an image one.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.560]   - Well, look, if they could just make Siri work
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.880]   like the way it was supposed to using an LLM
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.560]   and have it be like snappy,
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.460]   that'd be a major upgrade to the iPhone.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.920]   I don't think you need to buy a new iPhone for that
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.240]   'cause it'd just be a software upgrade,
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.160]   but just getting Siri to work would be a big win.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.960]   - I think that's where they're going with their silicon,
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.720]   and they just announced the M3 on the MacBook Air.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.000]   It's like they're making their own silicon,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.480]   and I think it's going to power LLMs locally on the devices,
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.880]   and that's so powerful.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.640]   I was using iPhoto this week,
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.360]   and in Apple Photos, there's now on certain images,
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.400]   if you swipe through them, you'll see the little AI icon.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.640]   When you click it, it tells you things in the photo,
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.120]   like that's a bulldog, that's pasta.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.320]   And so they're already subtly adding these features.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.120]   Now, that's a feature Google's had
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.640]   in Google Photos for five years,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.280]   but go ahead and open your phone right now
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.140]   and search for a dog or a bulldog
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.400]   or whatever type of dog you got, you know, Labrador,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.160]   and then watch Golden Retriever,
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.360]   that it actually knows how to do it.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360]   They never announced it.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.700]   It's just subtly being put in there,
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.200]   so there's so many opportunities.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.120]   - If they required a hardware upgrade
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.200]   to get actually good AI built into the software,
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.020]   then everyone's going to have to upgrade for that.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:07.860]   - You'd be on 16.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.280]   - That's a pretty big motivation to upgrade.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.160]   - There you have it, Tim Cook.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.840]   Somebody send this clip to Tim Cook.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.280]   Put AI chips on your phone.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.380]   - But this isn't hard, right?
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.760]   I mean, all they gotta do is just
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.240]   take the latest open source models
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   and figure out how to customize them for their own products.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.080]   - Yeah, and they're doing it.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.120]   They're doing it right now.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.640]   All right, let's go to issue four, TikTok bipartisan ban.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.920]   Will the CCP agree?
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.280]   A bipartisan group of a dozen plus lawmakers
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.760]   introduced a bill that would effectively ban TikTok.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.800]   In the House this week, the bill is officially called
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.360]   "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.120]   "Controlled Applications Act."
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.480]   Gives ByteDance 165 days to divest from TikTok.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.600]   That's the parent company,
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.480]   the Chinese company that owns TikTok,
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.600]   the app that's very popular in the West,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.320]   especially here in America.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.720]   It would make it illegal for companies like Apple and Google
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.140]   to show TikTok in their app stores.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.960]   As you know, TikTok, 170 million US users,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:05.120]   and they claim that they're headquartered in Singapore.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.960]   I know people who have worked at TikTok
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.160]   or do work at TikTok, and they said that's nonsense to me.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.800]   The company said it has not and will not share user data
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.280]   with the CCP.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.720]   In my mind, it's an obvious lie.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.800]   In 2021, the CCP took a board seat
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.260]   on ByteDance Beijing-based subsidiary.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.280]   That's according to Reuters.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.040]   And then in 2022, ByteDance admitted that it accessed
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.600]   IP addresses and data by journalists covering TikTok
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.040]   to see if they'd been in the same places
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.940]   as ByteDance employees, obviously to find leakers.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.880]   And ByteDance claims they fired the people involved,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.720]   yada yada.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.280]   Last year, a former head of engineering of ByteDance US
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.420]   said CCP members had god mode access to user data in 2018.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.000]   Sax, I can go explain more of this,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.640]   but I just got to go to you here.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.980]   If ByteDance is not spying on Americans
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.800]   and the CCP is on the board, that
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.120]   would make no logical sense to me.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   And why are they fighting the divestiture
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.920]   if it's just the financial reason?
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.760]   Why would they take the CCP off their board?
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.800]   Do you think it's spyware?
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.600]   Do you think the US is crazy for allowing this product?
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.960]   Here in the United States, when we're not allowed to put
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.000]   Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, pick your social network,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.880]   in China, we have zero reciprocity here.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.960]   Look, if it's true that TikTok is sharing data with the CCP,
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.620]   then I think the United States is well
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.360]   within its rights to either ban it or cause it to be divested.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.720]   And I personally like the divestiture option.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.520]   I mean, that's what Trump was suggesting during his term.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.560]   Because we don't, I think, in the United States like to just
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.960]   essentially confiscate or destroy people's property.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.520]   But I think we are within our rights
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.560]   to require it to be divested to an entity
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.240]   that we know is completely separate from and won't
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.120]   cooperate with the CCP.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.320]   This bill is better than the last bill
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.680]   we talked about that was targeted at TikTok.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.400]   I don't know if you remember that one.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.240]   But it was weirdly prohibiting Americans from using VPNs
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.040]   and gave the government the right to go after Americans
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.920]   who were using VPNs.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.200]   So this one seems cleaner and better and more narrowly
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.040]   targeted at divestiture.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.460]   Now, at the beginning of my response to you, I did say if.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.680]   I know that everyone's just assuming
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.160]   that it's true that TikTok is sharing data with the CCP.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.920]   But I just want to confirm that that is the case.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.160]   Because they are denying it.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.280]   And I can understand why people think it
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.200]   and why it might even be likely.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.100]   But since we do have a concept of due process in America,
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.640]   I do think some evidence should be provided that that actually
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.120]   is taking place.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.000]   Well, we've had whistleblowers inside there.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.480]   But Chamath, if the CCP is spying on their own citizens,
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.020]   what are the chances that they wouldn't take the opportunity
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.280]   to spy on government officials who
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.760]   have TikTok on their phone or their kids
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.960]   and get compromise on them possibly
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.520]   or no locations of people?
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.480]   What does your gut tell you?
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.840]   Is this too dangerous for us to have here
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.900]   in America under CCP control or this kind of influence
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.520]   being on their board?
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.280]   I think you're asking the exact right question.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   I have two comments to make.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.680]   One is, Nick, if you can bring up
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.520]   this article about the Google AI IP case.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:29.280]   Basically what happened was that the DOJ filed an indictment.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.480]   Actually, I think I sent you guys the actual indictment.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.800]   But essentially what happened is there was an engineer at Google
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.160]   that has been charged with stealing AI secrets for China.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.080]   And I don't know whether he's back in China now or not,
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.680]   but the whole point is that if it's happened at Google, where
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.960]   there is a motivation for the Chinese intelligence apparatus
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.480]   and, frankly, every intelligence apparatus
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.960]   to infiltrate that organization and get access
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.000]   to all kinds of data, I think we should
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.800]   presume by default that all of these organizations
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.120]   are infiltrated.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.480]   And I think that that's probably a more conservative and
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.360]   reasonable posture.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.640]   So Facebook is infiltrated, Google is infiltrated,
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.840]   Apple is infiltrated, TikTok is infiltrated.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.640]   So on that dimension, I think that it
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:26.040]   should be considered 100% certainty that this data is
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.120]   getting back to not just the Chinese,
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.960]   but multiple state-sponsored actors.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.520]   So the question about TikTok then, I think,
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.680]   should be one of business.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.840]   And I think Palmer Luckey did a very good job of simplifying
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.040]   this down to its essence, which is essentially
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.960]   what he called the law of equivalent exchange.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.000]   If you want to just play this, it's like just a few seconds.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.120]   I was kind of frustrated that people made TikTok
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.920]   into a cultural issue.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.960]   By the way, I'm totally on the culture war side of it.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.400]   But I was saying, practically speaking, you should not
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.080]   make this a culture war issue.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.040]   Don't talk about how it's ruining our used ideals.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   Just say strictly on a trade basis.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.000]   We cannot allow them to sell this thing to us if we can't
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.520]   sell the same thing to them.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.680]   That should be totally fair.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.240]   That's reciprocity.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240]   That's reciprocity.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.720]   Me and Palmer Luckey and Singh.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.200]   Right, so this is what he calls the law of equivalent exchange,
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.880]   and I think it just makes a lot of sense.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.760]   So on the face, what I would say is, Jake, out of my responses,
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.080]   I think that the CCP, but also other intelligence
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.440]   organizations, have infiltrated all of these big companies,
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.520]   and all of our data is accessible by them.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.080]   I'm not going to say on a whim, but I think it's accessible.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.480]   I think you have to deal with TikTok as a business issue,
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.120]   and I agree with Palmer Luckey, which
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.520]   is they should not be able to sell to us,
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.640]   but we cannot sell to them.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.120]   And I think that that's a fair principle that we can live on.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.840]   Reciprocity is a very simple position.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.600]   Friedberg, let me use your creativity, your love of cinema.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.800]   If you were to use this tool, let's take the most cynical
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.000]   approach here, or interpretation.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.560]   CCP has complete access to the algorithms,
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.600]   and they want to do maximum damage,
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.000]   let's say, during the election.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.380]   Let's say in a conflict like the one going on in Ukraine
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:15.320]   with Russia or in Gaza.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.800]   What could they do using the algorithm, using videos?
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.560]   What would be the doomsday scenario for America?
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.840]   As in the CCP comes in and influences
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.280]   the management of this company and tells them
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.920]   what to tweak and how and why?
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.280]   Yes, what would they do?
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.800]   I think we saw this after October 7
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:43.400]   that there was a significant surge in pro-Hamas videos
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.080]   relative to Israel support video.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.540]   That's the sort of thing where you could kind of see something
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:55.420]   that sets an opinion that may be disruptive to the social fabric,
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.360]   to the election cycle, that starts
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.640]   to get shared more frequently and shows up
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.160]   in feeds more frequently.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.840]   Unlike Facebook and other places where there's a linear feed
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.160]   where you can scroll up and select what you want to watch,
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.000]   as you know, TikTok has already lined the videos up.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.680]   So when you scroll up, they automatically
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.280]   play the next thing for you.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.240]   So the ranking really matters in terms of viewership on TikTok,
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.960]   unlike a lot of other kind of select-to-play social media
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.500]   type networks.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.960]   Could it shift an election?
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.740]   Hearts and minds in a war?
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:26.900]   Well, I've always said this.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.700]   I think it's the craziest thing in the world
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.000]   that someone can spend advertising dollars
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.760]   and change someone's vote.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.420]   Just think about that fact for a second.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.080]   I mean, I've said this before, and people
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.020]   have told me I'm an idiot for saying it, but--
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.240]   Meaning that you can, or that it does?
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.320]   That both.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.860]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.340]   But think about it, like people don't individually
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.800]   go and gather data and then make an informed opinion about who
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.880]   they're going to vote for.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.720]   Their opinion changes based on seeing an ad.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.580]   It is so crazy to me that that's the truth.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.180]   I think the country knew that it does.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.680]   That's why they prevented it from happening until--
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.620]   For so long.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.000]   But I mean, I think that's what's so nuts is that there's
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   no longer a forced discourse that kind of makes people go
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.880]   out and choose what content they want to consume,
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.520]   what they want to hear, debate stages, et cetera.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.360]   That now it's about who spends the most money
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.200]   to get the most views in front of someone,
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.600]   and that that actually influences someone's decision
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:29.120]   on who to vote for is what's so compelling to me about why
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.360]   all of these systems have such extraordinary power.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.880]   It's just so amazing to me that the more frequently someone
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.080]   sees an ad, the more likely they are to buy something
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.000]   or do something.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   Here's the bottom line.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.080]   This thing is incredibly--
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.040]   So the more frequently you show someone a memetic on TikTok,
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.480]   the more likely they are to vote something differently.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.080]   This thing is far too powerful for the CCP
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.680]   to have any kind of access to it,
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.100]   for the Chinese government to have any kind of access to it.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.320]   It has to be divested.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.840]   If you look at what we went through
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.520]   in the last couple of election cycles,
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.880]   not being partisan in here at all, but we've said
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.720]   and we've talked about Hunter Biden's laptop
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.480]   is but one example.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.160]   That was suppressed, obviously, on social networks.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.240]   That could have been amplified in social networks,
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.160]   and it could have had the opposite effect.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.760]   Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump this, Hillary this,
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.880]   Biden that.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.800]   You could really sway an election
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.320]   by putting in specific, subtle information, let alone
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.240]   taking a hack and releasing it like they did
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.400]   with Hillary Clinton's email.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.720]   So those things might not have swayed an election.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.240]   But, Sax, if Putin had access to this,
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.000]   like somebody who's super capable,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   and he had access to 170--
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.680]   Of course, that's always where it goes.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.280]   No, I just--
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.720]   Is Putin is suddenly pulling the strings of our election?
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.040]   Iran, okay, Iran, North Korea.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.840]   This is like the biggest threat inflation ever.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.480]   Okay, look, if you ask people out there,
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.040]   do you think other people's votes
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.080]   are influenced by social media?
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.800]   They'll say, yeah, of course, people are brainwashed.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.920]   If you say to them, is your own vote
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.160]   influenced by social media?
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.920]   Do you make up your own mind
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.800]   based on all the information you have?
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.760]   They'll say, yeah, of course, I'm not brainwashed.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.840]   Everybody else is.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.520]   And I believe that people are closer to telling the truth
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.920]   when they're talking about themselves
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.160]   because they understand their own situation
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.680]   better than they understand everyone else's situation.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.640]   The fact of the matter is that all of us
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.960]   are constantly bombarded with information,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.640]   24 hours a day, seven days a week,
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.400]   through all of the channels, both online and offline,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.680]   where we get information.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.080]   Some of those data points come from advertisements,
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.560]   but I don't think we take ads very seriously.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.000]   We're trained to kind of even just block out the ads.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.800]   When I see banner ads or even ads in my stream,
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.680]   I just scroll past them.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.280]   They don't even factor in my consciousness.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.960]   I am influenced by accounts that I follow,
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.840]   but there are accounts that I've chosen to follow
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.200]   because I think they have signal over noise.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.280]   And the more noisy those accounts are,
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.080]   the more I disregard them and take them less seriously
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.960]   with advertisements being the most noisy
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.120]   and least useful channels.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.880]   So look, I think at the end of the day,
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.960]   this idea that we're all being brainwashed
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.720]   and secretly influenced by maligned foreign actors,
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.840]   I think, is at a minimum threat inflation,
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.120]   and that entire narrative might just be completely bogus.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.440]   Nonetheless, I do agree that for data collection reasons
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.760]   and reciprocity reasons, I think it's, like I said,
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.800]   we're within our rights to require
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.320]   the divestment of TikTok.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.080]   - Yeah, I don't, you know, it's actually, you said on this--
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.120]   - But don't make this into more than it is.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.520]   Again, I think this whole disinformation narrative,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.080]   by the way, you wanna know why they push it so hard?
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.520]   It's because our own intelligence community
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.640]   wants to be involved, and there are political actors
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.440]   in the US who wanna regulate, quote, disinformation
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.760]   on our own social networks.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.960]   I'm not talking about TikTok, I'm talking about X,
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.520]   I'm talking about Facebook, Insta, and so on.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.360]   And we saw this in the Twitter files.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.440]   We saw what a cozy relationship
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.760]   the intelligence community had with Twitter.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.920]   They were all up in there trying to control
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.480]   what legacy Twitter was allowing
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.320]   and what they were censoring. - They blocked the
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.160]   New York Post URL.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.400]   They blocked the New York Post URL.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.240]   And you've said on this program that you believe
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.840]   that could have swung the election.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.680]   - Well, I think it was, I think that actually
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.240]   was genuine election interference.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.400]   I actually said that I didn't know
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.640]   whether it could swing the election.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.720]   I think that, but I think that--
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.240]   - Well, do you think it could have?
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.600]   - I think it was a story that deserved to be published
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.800]   so that, and distributed online,
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.960]   so that the public could take that into account
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.480]   when they voted, I mean--
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.760]   - And so if it had been widely received,
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.000]   do you think, I'm asking a question,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.520]   you're not answering it. - How would I know?
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.440]   Okay, you're asking me a question
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.480]   that I personally think is irrelevant.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.520]   How would I know whether the suppression
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.300]   of that story swung the election?
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.320]   How could I know that?
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.720]   The point is that the American people
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.240]   were deprived of information that they had every right to--
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.000]   - Most Republicans believe if that had come out,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.520]   it would have swung the election.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.840]   - Well, I can't prove.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.720]   I can't prove that it swung the election.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.200]   What I'm saying is that it was
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.640]   a type of election interference.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.920]   Why was that story suppressed?
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.720]   Because 51 former intelligence officials
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.320]   who still maintain close relations
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.920]   with the intelligence community published a bogus letter
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.080]   saying that it was Russian disinformation, which it wasn't,
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   and then that caused our social media sites to suppress it.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.960]   So that, to me, is as concerning, if not more concerning,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.740]   than whatever it is that TikTok's accused of.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.800]   So I don't want social media companies being used
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.140]   by the intelligence communities of either China
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.180]   or the United States to swing or to influence our elections.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.140]   And we need to be equally concerned about that
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.900]   as we are about supposed Chinese influence.
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:43.740]   - Just to go back in time,
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.420]   you probably remember the Willie Horton ad.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:47.620]   I mean, that kind of sunk Dukakis, if you remember that.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.620]   I mean, media and these ads can really have a big impact.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.600]   So people should just look historically.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.460]   There have been many moments where,
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.840]   whether it's Nixon sweating on TV or the Willie Horton ad,
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.620]   there have been many moments where video can do this.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.120]   And I think they could be done even more subtly
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.860]   by the Chinese by just promoting certain videos.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.540]   All right, let's move on to Bitcoin.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.700]   Issue five, Bitcoin's back, baby.
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.140]   It hits an all-time high.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.740]   69,000, interesting number on Tuesday.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:19.500]   69,000 before dropping, sitting around 68K.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:23.060]   As we're taping, there'd be 75 by the time you hear this,
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:26.700]   or 50, it's been ripping in 2024,
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.940]   up 70% since January 25th.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.540]   There's two things going on here
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.620]   that you've probably heard about.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.260]   The Bitcoin ETFs finally arrived in the US.
[01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.900]   They were approved by the SEC on January 10th.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.820]   We'll get into them in a minute, Chamath.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.940]   Obviously, if it's an ETF,
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.780]   it's super easy to buy them and sell them.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:45.680]   They've been a total hit.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.060]   BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF became the fastest ETF
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:51.340]   to ever reach 10 billion in assets.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:55.180]   Also, as the technical crypto heads in the audience know,
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.660]   there is a halving happening in April.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.900]   This happens about every four years at the current pace.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.300]   Last one was May of 2020.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.900]   When these halfings happen,
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:07.180]   the mining rewards are cut in half.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.900]   This reduces the supply of new Bitcoins
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:12.940]   entering circulation and can cause some swings.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.460]   Chamath, we released a clip, I think,
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:20.340]   just about your prediction, and you nailed it again.
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.860]   You said this would be a big year for Bitcoin.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.920]   So your thoughts on being right.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.860]   - I don't have much thoughts on that,
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.360]   but my two comments are that
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.100]   I talk to a lot of Bitcoin traders and folks
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:36.860]   that seem to have a very good pulse and touch
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.700]   on this market.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.020]   I don't say that I do
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.620]   because I don't really look at it every day,
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.100]   but they seem to think that this thing
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.980]   is on a death march to 100K.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.880]   I'm not sure whether that price is realistic or not
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.420]   in a year, but I will say that
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:53.980]   we're gonna get to a tipping point
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:56.660]   where everybody really talks about this.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.940]   I still don't think we're there yet.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.740]   I think we're just at the beginning.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.560]   But when you see the inflows into these ETFs,
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.400]   Jay Cal, it's like a very big deal
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.780]   because it just allows every mom and pop individual
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:11.220]   to buy some to the extent that they want to own it
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.620]   or they want to speculate on it, whatever it is.
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:17.220]   So I think it's been a very big year,
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.160]   and I think that psychologically
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.740]   it's proven a lot of folks wrong
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.280]   and it's a setup for something really constructive.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.540]   The other thing I'll say is that it's not just Bitcoin,
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:34.860]   but as goes Bitcoin, there are a handful of other things.
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.320]   People are now speculating that there's gonna be
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.120]   an Ethereum ETF that gets approved as well,
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.920]   because if you approve one,
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.500]   there's probably legitimate cause to approve a few others.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.100]   So these things are becoming part of the financial fabric.
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.460]   And I think that that should not be underestimated.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.220]   - And the SEC is still taking action
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.660]   against certain bad actors in crypto.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.940]   There were a couple of those this week,
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:59.120]   but Bitcoin, Friedberg, is incredibly resilient,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.140]   just on a technological basis.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:04.860]   The fact that it hasn't broken down under stress,
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:08.680]   it hasn't had a denial of service type of attack,
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.220]   or a government hasn't been able to capture
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.680]   51% of the mining, or some great amount of it,
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.380]   or just even be hacked in any way,
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.180]   you have to be impressed by the fundamental technology here,
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.380]   Friedberg, maybe you could speak to that level of success,
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.860]   that this thing is so stable
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.900]   and trustworthy and reliable to date.
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.180]   - It's got a great incentive model.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.120]   As long as Bitcoin price remains high,
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.220]   the miners will still be there
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.540]   and the system will keep running.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.960]   If Bitcoin price drops, transaction fees will decline,
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.520]   the value of mining will decline,
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.440]   and it kind of goes the other way as well.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.100]   I think the real question is, in the last couple of years,
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.340]   have we really seen a change in Bitcoin
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:57.600]   being used for transactions or for commerce
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.060]   in any meaningful way?
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.340]   I think the answer is still likely not.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.180]   - No, definitely not.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.100]   - And it's really a stored value system,
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.300]   and it's become this kind of stored value asset.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.860]   - Friedberg, this microplastics thing,
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.860]   we talked about it on the show,
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:15.020]   and since that time, I refuse to open plastic bottles.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:16.300]   I'm doing all glass.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.540]   I'm getting rid of all this goddamn plastic.
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:21.400]   I already did glass bottles in my house 'cause I'm cheap,
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.860]   and I like to fill it from my water filter,
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.360]   but we're uncovering more information.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.080]   And then I saw this headline this week
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.460]   that microplastics are in our blood streams in some cases,
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.400]   and what the heck does that mean?
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.320]   - It's worse than that.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.460]   - Team of scientists in Italy collected samples
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:43.340]   from patients that had plaque removed
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.580]   from their carotid artery.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:48.100]   It's a kind of common cardiac procedure
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.820]   where you get plaque that blocks up in your carotid,
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.700]   they go in, they remove the plaque.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:57.360]   So a total of 304 patients agreed to have the plaque
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:01.300]   that was removed from their artery submitted for analysis.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.500]   And then what this team did is they took that plaque
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.900]   and they studied it to see
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.880]   how much plastic was found in that plaque.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.960]   And they used a bunch of measurement techniques to do this,
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.960]   including electron microscopy and mass spec,
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.500]   'cause it's really hard to find these molecules.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.820]   And microplastics or nanoplastics, remember,
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.280]   are less than five millimeters in size
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.280]   with a mean level of 21 micrograms per milligram of plaque.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:35.120]   Roughly one per 50 is the ratio of plastic to plaque
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.280]   that they found, which is really incredible
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.020]   because it shows that plastics,
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:40.860]   these little nano and microplastics are accumulating-
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.140]   - Incredible good or incredible bad?
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.660]   - Incredible bad, that these microplastics,
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:48.640]   these nanoplastics are accumulating in the human body.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.520]   Now here's the scary part.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.200]   They then did a follow-up 34 months later.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.100]   The patients that had plastic in their blood
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.940]   had a four and a half times higher ratio
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:01.540]   or likelihood of having a heart attack,
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:04.100]   stroke or death from any cause.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.660]   So all of these major health effects
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.480]   were four and a half times elevated
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.580]   in patients that had plastic in their blood.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.580]   This was published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:14.420]   if I didn't say it.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.700]   It really indicates that there is
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:18.060]   this kind of cumulative problem
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.940]   and that the cumulative problem is likely leading
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.260]   to really adverse health outcomes.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.860]   And I'll just highlight one other paper
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.140]   from a team in Germany and Norway back in May of 2022.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.540]   And this team tried to figure out how plastics
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.260]   are causing adverse health effects in the body.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.720]   And they had a theory like let's put little microplastics
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.940]   or nanoplastics together with all the human cells
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.860]   that we know, shake it up and see what happens.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.440]   And what they found were that these little plastic fragments
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.300]   were binding to dendritic cells and monocytes,
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.500]   key cells in the immune system.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:53.020]   And when those cells were bound by plastic,
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.540]   they release these cytokines
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.340]   and the pro-inflammatory signals go through the roof.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:59.500]   It causes the immune system to go high wire,
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.220]   increases inflammation and the cascading effects
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.300]   of that obviously can ultimately lead
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.180]   to many of the events that we're mentioning
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.620]   were measured in this set of patients in Italy.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:12.380]   So again, we're just starting to uncover these effects,
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:15.420]   this concept that microplastics and nanoplastics
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.240]   that are accumulating.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.120]   And let me just say these plastics are mostly PET,
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.940]   which is what we use to make plastic bottles
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.540]   that we drink water and drinks out of,
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.820]   and PVC or polyvinyl chloride,
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.100]   which is what a lot of our plastic plumbing
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.700]   and piping is made from.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.220]   And so as little tiny bits of these plastic materials
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.140]   either are exposed to sunlight and break off
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:36.420]   and end up in our water and food supply and we consume them,
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.060]   they are slowly accumulating in bodies
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:41.200]   and they may be driving inflammatory response,
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.540]   they may be driving adverse health outcomes.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.160]   We're really kind of tip of the iceberg
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.620]   and really studying this, understanding and analyzing it.
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.680]   But here's another really interesting empirical data set
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.300]   that highlights that this really is a pretty significant,
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:57.280]   half the patients had it and of that half,
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.680]   they had a four and a half times higher chance of dying
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.000]   or having a heart attack or a stroke
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.980]   in the 34 months that followed.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:07.880]   - Yeah, the thing that that study said, which was nuts,
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.640]   is it looked like the nanoparticles,
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.280]   the nanoplastics and microplastics
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.080]   were effectively acting as scaffolding for plaque.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:20.080]   So in almost like it was a shim that allowed it to grow.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.740]   The question is, would it have grown faster
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.100]   than it would have otherwise?
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.260]   That's even scarier.
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.260]   So I did not like reading that paper.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.140]   That really freaked me out.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.900]   Really, really freaked me out.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.520]   - I was drinking water from plastic water bottles this week
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:40.260]   and every time I drink water out of a plastic bottle now,
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.660]   I'm like nervous every time I take a sip.
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:45.400]   - You're not supposed to double the risk
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.780]   of all cause mortality by drinking a Fiji water.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.620]   You know what I mean?
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:51.340]   - Four and a half X, four and a half X.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:52.260]   - It's crazy.
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.420]   - In 34 months.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.420]   - Think about the cumulative effect over time.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:56.820]   - Over time.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.040]   - Imagine drinking water out of a plastic bottle,
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.260]   thinking you're doing the right thing
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.860]   and then trotting over to the recycling bin.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:07.520]   And you do that for 20 years, you may be killing yourself.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.440]   - Well, there it is.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.420]   - So wait, what's the, if you, if the water's--
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:18.060]   - Glass bottles, you must use, you cannot use plastic.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:18.900]   You just cannot.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:20.780]   - It's over, no plastic, no plastic.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.620]   - You can't, you gotta stop.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.440]   It's over, it's done.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.280]   - We're drinking, it's done.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.840]   Glass, cans, good.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.580]   Plastic, stainless steel, stainless steel is fine.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.140]   - Just like I mentioned when we talked about this
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:33.020]   a few weeks ago, the carbon footprint,
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:35.600]   the environmental cost, the cash cost is much higher
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.380]   with all these alternatives to plastic.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.600]   So there are big challenges with respect
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.020]   to having some big, massive response to plastics
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:43.880]   used in our supply.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.540]   But, you know, living in the luxury world
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.480]   that we all get to live in, we get to have that choice
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.940]   and we'll make that choice.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:52.240]   But it's a real problem for humanity
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.940]   because plastics are so ubiquitous in so many things
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.680]   and they've enabled affordability of consumer goods.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.880]   - This is such bull (beep)
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.500]   Honestly, like all you have to do is have glass bottles
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.380]   or carry a water bottle with you.
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:07.980]   Like I have a Contigo one I like, I carry it with me,
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.140]   I empty it, I fill it. - No, but you can't.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:12.660]   - And I have a water filter in my house
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.820]   and we fill water bottles and put them in the fridge.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:15.960]   - No, but what if you like yogurt?
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.400]   Yogurt comes in a plastic container.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.700]   There's all kinds of stuff.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:20.420]   You can't avoid plastic.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.260]   That's what's so scary.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:22.920]   - We try to in our house. - That's what's so scary.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:25.100]   - We do have a French yogurt that comes in glass bottles,
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:25.940]   but yes, it is hard.
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.700]   - Ah, yes, we do the French yogurt in glass bottles.
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:28.540]   - It's so good.
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.360]   - It's so good.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.200]   - That's delicious.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.760]   - Wait, where do you get it from?
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   - There's a French yogurt that comes in glass bottles.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.600]   - A French yogurt.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.760]   - But how do we get water in plastic?
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.760]   - It's called like Le Benoit or something, Le Benoit.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.860]   - The water, you just install a filter system,
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.820]   which you have at the mausoleum
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.860]   and just fill huge glass bottles.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.860]   - Just have your staff fill glass bottles
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.860]   and put them in the fridge and don't throw them away.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.260]   And give your kids like some of these thermoses or whatever,
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.260]   but don't have the water bottles.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.460]   Like, you know, it's so funny.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.940]   It's been a disaster in the poker game in some ways.
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:01.740]   We got rid of it and there's been way more broken glass.
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:05.260]   People knock over the, you know, the side tables.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:06.100]   I get it.
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.700]   It's been a huge pain, but I will not go back.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.580]   - No, it's the right thing to do.
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:11.620]   - Absolutely. - It's the right thing to do.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.520]   - Okay, well, if Tamath is endorsing this,
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.880]   I guess I'm gonna take it seriously.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.100]   - I think you gotta do it.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.620]   - My opinion doesn't matter, Sax.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:20.940]   I'm not saying you're wrong.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.860]   I'm just saying that your threshold
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.980]   for becoming concerned is lower.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.540]   And then if it hits Tamath's threshold, which is higher,
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.940]   I'm gonna take it more seriously.
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:34.900]   - As your bestie, I would like you to stop using plastic
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.980]   for the rest of your life.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:36.800]   - Okay. - Please.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.740]   - If you're in a position to do it,
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.420]   I would ask you to not do it.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.260]   - All right, everybody.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:43.060]   - Can all you (beep)ers come back to the Bay Area
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:44.340]   so we can see each other? - Yes, absolutely.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.180]   I miss you guys. - I heard this.
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.020]   - Love you guys.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:47.840]   I miss you.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.840]   I miss you guys, too, for the Sultan of Science,
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.880]   the Chairman Dictator, and the Rain Man, David Sax.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.280]   I am the world's greatest moderator.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.160]   Okay, love you guys.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.000]   I gotta go. - Love you.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:32:59.820]   - Love you. - See you next time.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:00.660]   Bye-bye.
