[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140]   So the deep question I want to tackle today that will uncover this point is given all of the advantages of controlling your own
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.880]   digital press
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.880]   Why does so many creatives?
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.780]   rely on Twitter
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.820]   Communicate with their audience
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.820]   I
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:36.740]   I'm Cal Newport and this is deep questions the show about living and working deeply in an increasingly
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.420]   distracted world
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.780]   I'm here in my deep work HQ joined as always by my producer
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.000]   Jesse Jesse I found a way
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.720]   To against all the promises I've made to our listeners to work baseball back into the show
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.680]   Opening day next week opening day next week. We will be a podcasting live from that spark
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.100]   No, we're not we should though we could possibly podcast live from the bullpen. It's still my yeah, that's right
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.780]   You have the connection there
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.460]   It's still my dream that Mike Rizzo at some point is going to get connected to this general manager of the Nationals to this podcast
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.060]   and say what we need is like Cal to come talk to our front office and
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.360]   I just come in there talk about role without email talk about deep work next season world series
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.080]   And there they are the trophies being handed out and I'm kind of sort of on the field, you know
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.040]   But I'm not up there on the dais and Rizzo just gives me the finger point and I just give him like the thumbs up
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   it's like a real emotional and he's sort of acknowledging that the front offices embrace of
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.180]   Deep work and non context switching collaboration process processes was really kind of at the foundation of the next World Series run. I
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.200]   Think the reasonable dream, but anyways what I wanted to what I wanted to show you I'm working baseball in here subtly
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600]   I want to show you something that
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.120]   The Washington Post did in their coverage of a spring training game national spring training
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.720]   Spring training game from earlier this last week actually, so if this is airing on Monday, it was early last week
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.700]   the Nationals were playing the Yankees with actually most of the Yankees lined up - Aaron judge and
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.120]   Well Kinsey Gore pitch six innings two hits pretty good. But here's what I wanted to talk about
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   So I have this up on the screen now
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.700]   So for those who are watching at youtube.com slash Cal Newport media, this is episode 241
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.780]   You can also find this at the deep life comm so here's the Washington Post is up on the screen
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.500]   What they did
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.480]   Was they switch to a live blog format to cover the game now what they would normally do up until this point
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.360]   This is considered an experiment up until this point
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.940]   Coverage of the games as they unfolded happened on Twitter
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.040]   So the two beat reporters Jesse Doherty and Andrew Golden would just tweet
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.180]   Throughout the game to give their updates about what's going on or what they've what they've heard and they were experimenting this time with well
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.980]   Why don't we live blog it? That's what's on the screen now so you can see Jesse
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.140]   Jesse Doherty not producer Jesse
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.740]   Having various length updates on this page at the Washington Post about what's happening some of them longer than others
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.000]   So they were considering this to be an experiment
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.660]   So here's the thing
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.380]   It makes so much sense to cover
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.980]   Your games this way as compared to on Twitter. Here are the advantages. It's a nicer format
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.220]   Tweets are short and you have to do tweet threads with these one out of n where you have multiple different threads that go together
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.100]   it's
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.340]   cumbersome
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.340]   unrelated tweets intersperse
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.460]   Between the tweets you're doing about the game
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.940]   It's not a great
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.140]   Visual or reading format on a live blog they can spend as much time as they want
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.260]   so I have up here one post is a few paragraphs too long for a particular tweet all of the
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.580]   Live blog updates disappear all on the same page one after another formatted nicely
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.400]   No distraction doing it this way also creates new permanent content for your site
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.860]   So this now is an article right with a strong start for McKenzie Gore
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.640]   Nationals top Yankees at spring training where you have some summary at the top and all the live blog below
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.140]   So this actually becomes a permanent piece of content that actually has quite a bit of information in it
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.140]   So you get new content for your site?
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.820]   You also control the eyeballs right when Jesse
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.780]   Dorothy is tweeting about the game on Twitter the Washington Post does not control the eyeballs of people who are keeping up with these game
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.220]   Updates Twitter controls the eyeballs Twitter can show them its own ads Twitter can push them towards other tweet threads
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.800]   When you're on the Washington Post now we can
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   Show you other content
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.700]   Related to the Nationals now we can show you our own ads now
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.520]   We have the ability to funnel you towards subscription or towards email
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.260]   newsletter products
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260]   I mean it just makes so much more sense for a
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.580]   company that produces content for a living to have full control over the eyeballs that's reading their content and
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.220]   Perhaps most importantly for the reporters like Jesse Doherty
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.060]   To be able to do this work on your own site and not on Twitter
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.340]   Saves you from the anxiety distraction machine that is Twitter
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.140]   Because when you are on there, and I'm posted on Twitter. You're getting the reactions. You're getting the weirdness
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.640]   You're feeling the pressure to comment on other things that are going on you get obsessed with well
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.100]   Is this thing spreading how many people are reading this I see a lot of baseball reporters in particular
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.080]   This is a microcosm of the broader issue that Twitter creates for
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.020]   Journalists getting obsessed about being first on various types of scoops and and can I get John Heiman to?
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.900]   Quote tweet me and say I was first on it
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.240]   And there's all these weird incentives in it and none of this work is actually directly helping your home
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.220]   publication build up an audience or build up eyeballs want to tackle today that will uncover this point is
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.500]   Given all of the advantages of controlling your own
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.260]   digital press
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260]   Why does so many creatives?
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.140]   rely on Twitter
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.340]   to communicate with their audience
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.540]   Now I want to dive deep into this question today because I think in answering this question. We're gonna find out that the
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.860]   Incentives that are drawing us to these platform monopolies like Twitter are actually not as strong as we think so we can get an
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.180]   intimation of a more healthy relationship
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.580]   with the digital world
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.300]   After we do that deep dive on this question
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:41.220]   I have a collection of questions from you my listeners that all orbit around this general issue of grappling with social media and its role
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.660]   And you being a creative professional and how important it actually is
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.660]   And then we will switch gears at the end to do something interesting
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:57.340]   Alright, so that's our goal. So let's dive deeper on this question. Why are people especially creatives using Twitter?
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.020]   The obvious answer is going to be virality
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.500]   There's this idea that Twitter has this virality engine because of their retweet mechanism
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:14.500]   It is possible for things you write if it catches the attention properly of the cybernetic curation
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.220]   Organism, which is the combination of individual people making retweet decisions
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:25.540]   Plus the fact that the follower graph is has power law expansion the cybernetic curation algorithm has the capability of
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:33.940]   Spreading your tweet to a massive audience all at once perhaps even unexpectedly so their sense is I want to harness this potential virality to very quickly
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.260]   Grow a large audience this large audience is then something I can monetize or will give me a lot of influence
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.980]   That's the promise of Twitter
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:46.760]   Its virality can build you an audience much faster than any other method
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:55.020]   But is this supposed benefit of Twitter worth giving up all of the other advantages of controlling your own
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.380]   Platform the type of advantages we talked about with the Washington Post examples
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.260]   I want to give four reasons why I think the answer to that question is no
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:11.420]   Four reasons why I think the supposed benefits of Twitter virality are not as strong as many creative professionals who rely on that
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.420]   platform actually believe
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.580]   So here's my first reason
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.700]   Most people don't end up building a Twitter audience of any notable size
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:27.820]   The average creative professional who is tweeting never builds up a big follower account
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.180]   But you do not need a big follower account to reap the full
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.940]   negative impact of being on Twitter
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:41.540]   So you reap that full negativity of the distraction and the anxiety of even without a lot of followers if you say the wrong thing
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.100]   That could spread you have negative virality that hangs over your head
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:51.220]   Then there's also the the addictive distraction of what's catching on what's not am I getting retweets?
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.900]   When we had the comedian Jamie Kilstein on the show
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.060]   He really talked about that from the perspective of a comedian this experience of you're obsessively
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.540]   Checking after you tweet to see if someone famous retweeted it
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.980]   So you have all of those negatives even if your audience is small and most people have small audiences
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.340]   So this idea that Twitter is going to spread your genius to the world and build you this audience. It's actually very rare
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:21.100]   The second reason why I think this virality explanation is not so strong is that Twitter followers are
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.140]   much less valuable
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.180]   than an
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.860]   organically acquired
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.100]   follower
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.900]   So let's compare a Twitter follower to let's say
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.980]   someone who is
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:41.060]   Interacting with you on your own site or through your own podcast who say subscribes to your podcast or signs up for your email newsletter
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:47.180]   Because they have over time come to really trust you or appreciate you and your point of view that organic follower is
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.780]   significantly more valuable
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.420]   Than each digit that clicks up on your Twitter follower account
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.020]   Twitter followers are not that powerful
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.260]   Writers have known this for a long time Twitter followers do not convert well
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.540]   for example to book sales and I think this is a great natural experiment because how else did
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:13.260]   How else is better to test the loyalty of a follower than actually asking them to invest $15 on your behalf?
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.540]   book authors know this
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.540]   email newsletter subscribers
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.980]   They will buy books
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:25.180]   You can get up to a 10% even plus conversion rate on number of subscribers in your email list because those are organically acquired
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:31.220]   Followers who over time grew to trust you Twitter followers convert at a miniscule rate
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:37.700]   You can have hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers and when you start tweeting about your new book coming out it might generate
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:45.700]   Minuscule relatively speaking sales whereas a 10,000 person mailing list can actually make a dent in getting your book
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.900]   Noted so even if you can build up this large Twitter follower count
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.700]   it doesn't actually mean that you have a powerful audience a
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.460]   30,000 person mailing list I would argue is
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:06.340]   As useful as a high six-figure maybe even million Twitter follower count on Twitter
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.180]   So even if you do get the followers due to virality
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.900]   It's not necessarily that valuable
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:18.820]   The third objection I want to bring up here is that when you look at specific examples of
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.260]   People who have grown large Twitter followings
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.840]   Typically the forces that drove that audience growth were not internal to Twitter
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.740]   external exposure
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.700]   external fame is
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.340]   What actually brought them to the attention of a lot of people and people came to follow them on Twitter because that's where they happen
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:47.860]   To be producing so it's not that Twitter virality is for a lot of people how they got discovered
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.220]   It's that Twitter is where the people who discovered them elsewhere
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:57.700]   Came to follow them because that's where they happen to be. Let me make this more concrete with a specific example
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.260]   I think Conan O'Brien is a great example here
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.740]   So after Conan O'Brien took the tonight show as fired from the tonight show sort of was in the wilderness
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:12.300]   One of the things he started doing was tweeting and he did one tweet every day
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.500]   and it's this document there's a good documentary about this called Conan O'Brien can't stop and
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.700]   For a while the conventional wisdom was this is what got Conan relevant again
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.900]   he was interacting with people directly without TV and
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:34.820]   Doing these funny tweets and people were retweeting and following them and it kept him on everyone's mind and it kept him relevant, right?
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.860]   So sort of a case study of of Twitter being this great creative platform
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.380]   But here's the thing
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.780]   Conan realized
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.660]   What was valuable here was his pre-existing?
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:53.500]   fame his pre-existing talent as a comedy writer and on-screen comedic presence and his
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.580]   massive national exposure that he's had on TV and on radio and he's on Stern all the time and on
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.180]   Going on other people's shows. He's an incredibly well exposed person
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.060]   So yes when he went and said I'm gonna put my attention in the tweeting every day people went over there and said we'll follow
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.860]   Your tweets, but it wasn't that Twitter built of his audience. He had a big audience
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.140]   He just said this we're gonna hang out so they came over there
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:21.380]   Now speaking of our last point that Twitter followers are not that valuable Conan eventually figured out
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.660]   Having my audience follow me to Twitter is not useful to me. I
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.380]   Can't do much with Twitter followers
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:34.880]   So he stopped the tweeting every day and instead put his energy into making his own home
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.500]   online a home he owned which was his podcast and
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.780]   Now again his pre-existing fame and talent and massive exposure, which is what's generating all this attention
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.340]   That could now aim this attention to a home he owned
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.140]   Which was his podcast?
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.780]   Now what's the difference in value between these two things?
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.380]   well tweeting every day on Twitter got him a couple million followers and
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.020]   Maybe it helped some ticket sales when he was touring or maybe not
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.820]   The bringing that attention to his podcast they signed a I don't know the whole magnitude of it
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.300]   But it was tens of millions of dollars deal for his production company
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.420]   So taking this pre-existing fame and aiming it towards a platform
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.440]   He owned forget about the raw number like how many people download your podcast versus how many Twitter followers you have?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.500]   No, he turned his pre-existing attention to a platform
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.580]   He owned that was worth tens of millions of dollars when he put that attention instead towards someone else's platforms Twitter
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.740]   Maybe he got 20% higher ticket sales when he did live shows
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.140]   so the reality of many large Twitter audiences is
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.500]   Those audiences are there not because Twitter went out and found them but because the person was already famous and that's where they're hanging out
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.260]   Barack Obama doesn't have a large Twitter account because he's good at Twitter
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.020]   It's because he's Barack Obama
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.820]   All right. The final objection I want to bring up here
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.860]   to the idea that Twitter virality is so critical to any creative professional is that
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.220]   Twitter virality is best harnessed on your behalf as
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.100]   opposed to on your bequest
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.260]   So there's really two broad categories of information going viral on Twitter
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.900]   One type is that you know
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.020]   You actually tweeted something yourself that was smart or funny or outrageous
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.580]   And it caught the attention of the cybernet curation algorithm and spread really far. That's actually not that valuable
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.340]   I mean it can help attract more people to want to follow you
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.500]   But that does not actually directly translate necessarily to you being more successful at what it is
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.540]   You do the second type of virality on Twitter is where something is really good
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.620]   Something has been constructed or done that is very good
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.740]   a book is excellent an article is excellent a movie is excellent a video game is excellent and
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.740]   Twitter is spreading the word. This thing is great. You got to see this thing. You got to read this thing
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:52.940]   Let's debate about this thing that type of virality is incredibly valuable for a creative professional because it's not just raw attention
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.740]   It is attention on you and your skill and what you can produce
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:02.300]   It's the type of virality that will allow you to actually grow and cultivate new loyal organic audience members
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.980]   Now here's the thing
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.240]   That virality does not require you to be on Twitter
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.360]   In fact that virality is actually impeded if you were the person trying to tell people look at my article
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.820]   Look at my my movie I made that's a really bad way to kick off
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.160]   That isn't this great virality that type of virality is much more effective when it's third-party
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.220]   Look at this article Cal wrote is gonna do much better than me saying look at this article
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.260]   I wrote and you see this with creative professionals on Twitter
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:38.780]   They have this huge elaborate dance of self-deprecation to try to kick off the second category of virality and they'll be they'll say, you know
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.540]   I'm so blessed just to have such great editors and just to be noticed like this to have this article out
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.880]   So they're trying to find a way to make it palatable that they're the ones talking about it
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.360]   But in the end actually the best type of virality is people talking about you
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.140]   so you being on Twitter and
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:03.420]   Having to pay those prices of anxiety and addiction and distraction at the same time losing out on all the advantages of owning your own
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.740]   Platform controlling the eyeballs building up your own organic audience having that nicer format all these advantages
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.460]   To give all of that up
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.900]   to try to create this much weaker form of virality when
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:21.580]   Twitter can do this on your behalf if you're producing something good the trade-off really doesn't make really doesn't make a lot of sense
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.260]   All right, so what I'm trying to say here is there's a lot of advantages to releasing content on your own platform
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.900]   The main reason people do this instead on Twitter is virality
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:37.900]   But as those four virality myths I just talked about emphasize that reason really is not that attractive anymore
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.380]   So what is the alternative if you're a creative professional who wants to embrace the online world?
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.980]   Create the absolute best stuff you can
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.580]   released on your own platform
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.940]   Be this a web-based text platform or an audio based podcast
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.900]   Build a fiercely loyal audience slowly
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.980]   But steadily when you get a new member of your audience is because they've heard your stuff enough. They love it
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.940]   They really want to read it. It's not just a Twitter follower
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.100]   When your work occasionally goes viral on your behalf, which it will if it's good
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.540]   Enjoy the fact that you're now going to capture some more
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.940]   Listeners or readers or audience members in your own ecosystem and then get back
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.580]   The producing work too good to be ignored
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:26.820]   That I think is the right way to approach content production on the internet not to get
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:35.180]   Lured by the siren sound of these platform monopolies that basically just chew you up chew up your attention chew up your vanity and
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.980]   Make you into grist for their attention economy money-making mill. I
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:47.460]   Think this type of discussion is important for a broader reason as well. Let's move beyond just Twitter and content producers
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.980]   I think it's really easy when we think about the
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.060]   downsides or the excesses of the internet
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.900]   To get stuck in a hopeless feeling
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.180]   They get stuck in this hopeless place where you say well, of course, I have to use these platforms
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.020]   But I'm not liking the way what they're doing in the way they make me feel
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.380]   So if we can only just have the right laws passed
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.660]   Maybe we can fix this or if we can only have the right person by the platform
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.820]   And then they can fix it and make it better and these type of discussions show. There's another alternative
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:19.740]   You don't have to be that involved with these platforms in the first place. You can be cutting-edge online
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.480]   Growing your audience in 21st century ways
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.300]   without having to worry about
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.940]   What's happening with Twitter? What's happening on Instagram is tick-tock is going to be banned or not?
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.700]   I just hope we're moving past this age where we feel like platform monopolies are somehow a
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:42.720]   Critical piece of being a creative professional and if you somehow avoid those you're in trouble. You're not those advantages are overblown
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.420]   It's okay to move on
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.660]   So, there you go, I don't know that Connor O'Brien had such a big audience
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:57.180]   Yeah, so that's what I mean the tweeting every day was supposedly how he sort of
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:04.300]   Reengaged, you know refound relevance and regained his audience, but my argument is like actually that didn't lead to much
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.260]   What was important is when he started the podcast, right?
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.980]   Because then he had an actual thing he was creating that was very high quality and the audience he attracted there was actually valuable
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.260]   I don't know what the size maybe could look it up look up
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.340]   team Coco co co
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.580]   podcast deal
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.620]   So he has a couple other podcasts it produces but Conan O'Brien needs a friend as the main podcast
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.460]   And I know they just bought a big building in Los Angeles
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:37.340]   So there was some deal one of the network says like a the headline says 150 million dollar deal. So this is the verge
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.700]   Yeah, so Conan O'Brien's fame aimed at something he owns
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:49.100]   Generated 150 million dollars his fame instead generate aimed at Twitter generated a
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:57.100]   Lot of likes and maybe you know slightly more attention when he was trying to sell tickets. I think serious XM bought it
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.700]   And I think we can just explains why he's on
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.380]   Stern
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.100]   But he's all but that's true
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.500]   But he's been he went on Stern a lot like in that period right after he left a tonight show
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.320]   He was on he goes on Stern a lot. So I think I think he's done that for a long time
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.660]   But you can just scale that down. Okay, so most people are not as famous as Conan O'Brien so you can scale it down
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.780]   But the key thing is there's this that difference like let's say your notoriety is
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.780]   a tenth of Conan O'Brien's but like whatever you're still out there you're you're
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.780]   You're known you're on like some big podcast a lot. You had some big books or something
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:36.940]   You get to scale down those numbers. It's like Twitter will give you you know, an extra hundred people showing up at a show
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.780]   Only putting that attention towards the thing you own the scale it down by a factor of ten is maybe worth
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.900]   You know 1.5 million dollars a year in revenue. It's it's aiming
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:51.820]   Audiences come from you earn audiences by doing things notably Twitter this idea that I mean there are some viral influencers
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.500]   But it's a dark Faustian world. You don't want to be a your whole world is just being viral on Twitter
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.060]   No one really wants that these audiences are coming from other things you're doing
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.980]   So why take all that juice and basically give it the Twitter in exchange for peanuts?
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.260]   Alright, so I want to do some questions that all roughly orbit this topic before we do first
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.700]   Let me mention one of the the sponsors that makes this show possible and that is our friends at cozy earth
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:25.420]   Cozy earth bedding is made using only the finest premium vis cozy via SC o se from highly sustainable bamboo
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   Top designers choose cozy earth. It's been named to Oprah's favorite things five years in a row
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.040]   But I want to give you my individual pitch for this
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.380]   These sheets are very good. And let me tell you why they're very let me tell you the evidence that we actually feel
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.660]   They're very good
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.700]   Cozy earth sent me a free pair of these sheets and we enjoyed them so much
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.380]   We bought more
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:53.060]   We bought more these sheets from them because we actually don't want to have any other sheets on the bed
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.380]   And if we if they get out of rotation, my wife and I are very upset
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.660]   We've even boughten their PJs because we love the sheet material so much
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.540]   We love this idea that if we don't have their sheets on the bed a given week you can wear PJs that have that material
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.860]   It really is really comfortable. So this is an actual

[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.780]   All right, speaking of sponsors that I also use I want to talk about our friends at
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:34.780]   Zoc Doc Zoc Doc is the only free app that lets you find and book doctors who are patient reviewed
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.940]   Take your insurance and are available when you need them to treat almost any condition under the Sun
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.800]   Jesse I want you to I'm taking out my phone here. I want you to be the arbiter for our audience
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.820]   You got to confirm this. I'm showing Jesse now a text message on my phone
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.940]   from
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:00.140]   11 a.m. Today so from 30 minutes ago. So what what do you see on this text message here from my dentist?
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.820]   What is the URL Zoc Doc baby? There we go. Nice just 30 minutes ago. I have a
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:11.940]   Encounter with Zoc Doc my dentist uses Zoc Doc my primary care doctor uses Zoc Doc
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.540]   And I love it
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:20.220]   So it's a app you can use first of all to find doctors who are near your area take your insurance see reviews from real people
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:26.340]   Once you sign up for a doctor if they use Zoc Doc, they handle your paperwork through there
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You can do the paperwork in advance. They do
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.780]   Reminders about your appointment you can confirm what's going on
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:37.980]   You don't have to sit there with a clipboard and fill out all the same information every time it just makes a lot of sense
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:45.100]   Why just randomly look up a local doctor on Google or ask a friend using Zoc Doc makes it more
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.100]   consistent
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.060]   The other thing we like about Zoc Doc is we like saying the name Zoc Doc comm
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:58.740]   So sometimes Jesse and I joke about other products that could have an even longer
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.700]   sequence of those rhymes well, I want to briefly read a
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.060]   submission along these lines from Elliot
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.940]   So here is Elliot doing his
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:16.220]   His attempt to get an even better URL than Zoc Doc comm. Alright, so here's Elliot's ad

[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.580]   Elliot well done with that parody, but the real URL you need to know is

[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.940]   all of our ads today Jesse or feels like
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:06.660]   People that are deeply products that are deeply integrated my life at the moment. That's good. Yeah
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.740]   What we need is a a Poland spring
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:17.220]   Sponsorship Jesse keeps me my seltzer water addiction well served with our Poland spring
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.200]   Let's do some questions. What do we got? I sounds good
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.060]   First questions from will a 55 year old economist
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.780]   What do you think about Twitter's decision to put the number of views on tweets?
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.580]   I hate this change it adds an extra layer of stress before you can get that
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.100]   dopamine hit or like or
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.740]   reply
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:43.420]   Well, well I wrote something about this dynamic in my book digital minimalism where I was talking about
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.580]   Facebook and this is a very important
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:52.860]   Technological moment that explains a lot about our current relationship to social media
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.980]   especially the more compulsive use and the way the story unfolds with Facebook is that
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.860]   engineers at Facebook last decade
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:08.100]   Wanted to put the like button into the Facebook product for a very pragmatic
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.020]   Sort of nerd optimization reason they were seeing that under a lot of Facebook posts
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:19.700]   Many of the comments were very similar and low information. There's a lot of like great exclamation points good
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.220]   Congratulations, and you had to scroll through all of these low information single-word
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:30.220]   Exclamatory content comments to get to the interesting comments where people are actually adding information
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.300]   So the engineer said let's just add a like button
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.900]   This way if all you want to do is like yeah great. I love it
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.340]   You can just click that and there'll be a count of how many people liked it
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.340]   And then we won't have comments clogging it up. So the actual comments on the post would be more informative
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.220]   It's an engineering thing. They saw an inefficiency. They wanted to fix it
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:53.860]   It turned out however as an unintentional side effect of adding that like button to the Facebook platform
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.020]   engagement time went up and
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:04.300]   What was going on is that this like button though? This was not its original intent this like button was adding in an intermittently
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.900]   reinforcing indicator of attention
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.980]   You could now after you posted something on Facebook go back and check
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.820]   Are there likes how many likes and then you can come back and check an hour later?
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.460]   Has it jumped up or is it really as it really?
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.500]   Plateaued and different posts would generate different likes
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.820]   There is a slot machine aspect to it that maybe something about this post would break out to a wider spread and you might have
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.460]   A massive jump of likes on the post and this was very exciting and you never knew if that was going to happen
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:40.260]   We are wired to love that type of reinforcement. We are going to pull that virtual slot machine lever again and again and again
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.660]   So once Facebook stumbled into this innovation other platforms did the same thing
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.860]   So Instagram which at the time had not yet been bought by Facebook
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.220]   They came next and this became integrated into many other platforms
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:58.340]   There's an accidental mechanism of moderate behavioral addiction these type of stories by the way
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:04.820]   They fall into the wayside because I think a lot of the media narrative on social media right now is from
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.060]   Journalists who are obsessed with social media. They just want it to be
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.300]   More focused on what they like and fixing it. They want to fix it
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.120]   But they don't want to fix the issue of using all the time
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.820]   They don't want to fix the use it the issue of being addicted to it
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.180]   They just want to make sure there's not bad things on it
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.860]   Or if you're on the right, you want to make sure that people aren't being kicked off, but but we've lost track of this original thread
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.700]   But just not wanting to be on these things so much in the first place and these type of addictive intermittent reinforcement
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.720]   Mechanisms is a big driver of that engagement. So back to your question will
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.980]   By adding a view count to Twitter. You're adding a more highly dynamic highly salient
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.420]   intermittent reinforcement indicator
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.420]   Replies are a little bit slower on Twitter
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:54.480]   Retweets happen, but again, not that often for most posts. So this is an engagement issue for Twitter
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.340]   Most people most tweets didn't have a big audience get no replies and very few retweets
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:07.260]   By putting in the views though. You have a finer-grained number that can rack up higher even for relatively small accounts
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.820]   Now you have a more salient feedback mechanism
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:16.320]   You're gonna get people who are minor Twitter users and producers to come back and check more often to see what's going on
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.240]   There's other reasons that I've been given for why the view feature was added
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:26.880]   But I think this is one of the key implicit reasons why you want to add these type of feedback into it
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.780]   One of the reasons why tick-tock is so successful, by the way is
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.140]   They just go straight for the jugular on these mechanisms
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:40.060]   Right. So the the likes on Facebook the favorites on Instagram the views on Twitter is still
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:45.380]   Driven by actual humans and actual human interest it gives you intermittent
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.840]   Reinforcement because some stuff you post is better than others. Tick-tock doesn't really trust people
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.640]   I mean we already see this with their recommendation algorithm. They say I don't need someone to
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.540]   Favorite something. I don't need someone to spread something
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.000]   I don't even need someone to tell me who their friends are our algorithm will just tell you what you should look at
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.600]   Well, they do the same thing with views. So tick-tock will
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.480]   Artificially make your view counts go up and down
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.280]   Specifically to create the slot machine effect of you never know
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.560]   Which your tick-tocks might take off and because everything is just algorithmically recommended
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:27.440]   There's no human in the loop tick-tock can do this with incredible precision. They their algorithm can basically say, you know
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.220]   Jesse hasn't had a tick-tock get a lot of attention in a while
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   We're worried that you know, people are gonna stop watching
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.160]   Jesse's tick-tocks
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.600]   so let's just take one of his tick-tocks and we can just show it to 10,000 people and
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.700]   Now if you count on that jumps to 10,000 now, Jesse is like, you know
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:51.560]   I wasn't gonna quit tick-tock but this last thing I did got 10,000 views like maybe I'm on the cusp of
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.980]   Emerging as a tick-tock influencer. And so they just cynically and
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:04.440]   Cynically directly manipulate your attention with the exact same precision as someone putting in win-rate tables to a Las Vegas style slot machine
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.760]   That's part of the reason why they're so popular
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.240]   If you don't believe this talk to any young person who uses tick-tock I overhear these conversations on a regular basis
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:17.420]   And they will talk about their one big hit or their two big hits. That's all you need
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:23.220]   That's all you need to use it all the time. You know, I had this one thing and it got a hundred thousand views
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:30.140]   You know, I bet if I just tweak things a little bit, you know, Jesse's thinking like if my dance moves were a little bit sharper
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.800]   I'm gonna get that more regularly
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.840]   And so it's if they're just cynical about it. So anyways, it's it's a good question
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.020]   No, I don't like any of those features. But again, the answer to all this stuff is guys get off these platforms
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.680]   Get off these platforms do whatever your equivalent is of
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.220]   The Washington Post's live blogging instead of live tweeting
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.040]   baseball games
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.800]   I heard a conversation at Bevco Jesse the other day
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.460]   Or it's like I think was a date
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.380]   Young people first date you're in line or you're sitting at a table sitting at a table. Okay. It's trying to write
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.220]   and it was a two young people and they're on a date and
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:14.660]   He was getting see he was seriously getting points by talking about his one viral tick-tock
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.020]   he's like yeah, I was uh, you know, like
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.900]   It was a you know complicated hat on and all the young person stuff
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:26.180]   He's like, yeah, I got it. You got like a million views on that and she was impressed like he was definitely
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:32.580]   Sort of peacocking his tick-tock numbers, but you know how effective that is like that guy is
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.740]   Going to tick-tock now
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.260]   Constantly, I mean think about this feedback. He's a man
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.740]   sometimes things go big and it's like impressing the ladies and and
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.900]   Like I don't know why that guy over there sighing so loudly all the time. I wonder what's wrong with them, but I
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:53.260]   Don't know to be like depressed or intrigued or I mean my main issue was I was trying to write and they were right next
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.260]   To me and when you're on a date you're talking all the time and I was kind of frustrated by that but
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:02.420]   That's really funny. Yeah, I was gonna we're talking about is getting mad credit. Well because and also oh man
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.620]   So the dynamic of this conversation
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.800]   She opened it by being like, you know, one of my tick-tock Scott
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.560]   I forgot the number was but five thousand views and you could see he was
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.460]   Dusting off his glove like ready to throw his fastball. I was like, well, you know, I had one they got a million views
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:24.940]   It's so good, yeah the tick-tock knows what it's doing. I'll see what we got next year
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.780]   All right. Next questions from Adam a 43 year old furniture maker
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:37.020]   I find it sad that along with tweens teens and average adults some of our world's thought and business leaders are
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:43.220]   Similarly more concerned with playing in the attention economy than focusing on a deep life. I
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.820]   Mean, I agree with you Adam
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.860]   There is a sort of vanity
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.840]   Run amok thing going on here
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.100]   crossed with a insidious addictiveness
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:36:00.700]   Multiple people I've talked to for example who personally know Elon Musk are
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.820]   Baffled by the way that Twitter just took over his life. It makes no sense
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:11.900]   For him and what he's working on in his companies and his goals in life for him to spend so much time on Twitter is
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.340]   some weird combination of addiction fueled vanity
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.020]   no, I think there's a there's a a
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.800]   Key point to make here that distinguishes Twitter from other platforms
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:29.460]   So most of these platforms do play in part one of the many things they play on to win in the attention economy game
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.540]   One of the many things they play on is
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.380]   Personal vanity Twitter does it in a different way than the other platforms?
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.680]   So in deep work, I again I looked at Facebook. I
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.540]   Said Facebook in circa 2014 to 15 when I was writing deep work
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.620]   Had a collectivist attention model. So back then Facebook was still pretty heavenly driven by
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.800]   Friends, you know, I post things on my friends walls. They will check me
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:03.540]   They'll post thing on my post things on my walls and I argued that look Facebook was in part a response
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.580]   to the hostile
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:14.040]   Attention landscape of the web so early web 2.0 allowed almost anyone to post information online. You could have a blog
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.800]   Where you could just post whatever you wanted to post
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.540]   But it was a hostile attention regime because let's be honest most things that most people have to say is boring. It was rough
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.500]   You would start a blog you put things on there and no one would read it
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:34.900]   Because it was just your random stuff and no one cared. I had my very first blog. I started in college. It was called inspiring moniker
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.580]   zero readers
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.500]   Because why would people care so that was a very hostile?
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.500]   Attention environment and people said why am I just gonna keep putting stuff out there?
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.040]   And that's actually like a completely reasonable reactions like yeah, like most people actually shouldn't just be putting stuff out there
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.000]   But people who really have you know something to say it's like a young Ezra Klein doing his
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.920]   Political blog where he was posting nine times a day in 2004 like there's people who emerged they took advantage
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.640]   They had something to say they were skilled. They did the work and it was a great but for most people it's like yeah
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.400]   This you know, you don't have anything interesting to say Facebook said no. No, I have something for you attention collectivism
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.000]   You will have these friends. These will be people, you know, you will befriend them digitally
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.520]   They will befriend you digitally and the agreement will be I
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.160]   Will pay attention to whatever junk you put up there if you pay attention to whatever junk I put up here
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.780]   I'll put up some random photo
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.320]   You'll say oh so cute and you'll post some thought about something
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.100]   I'll be I'll come over and say ah, you got it right and we'll just give each other attention
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.960]   It's nice to feel it. You know, it's nice to get attention. Most people don't get attention and
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.400]   In most parts of their life, you know, people aren't paying positive attention to them
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.360]   So it monetized in some sense this desire to have people pay attention to us
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.840]   It reacted to the the hostile attention landscape of just the bare-bones web 2.0 and said no
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.960]   No, we'll just all agree to talk to people. We know and pat each other on the back
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.400]   And I thought this was a little bit shallow, but whatever it worked pretty well
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:05.120]   Twitter is doing something different here. It's offering sort of a similar dynamic but for actual what I would think of as
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.680]   higher tier
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.040]   thinkers
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.320]   And leaders, right? So it actually is its model is not focused on
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.120]   Anyone will post something and other people will come and comment on it. It's actually brutal like that
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:23.660]   It's brutal like web 2.0 for the average average user if I tweet something nothing happens
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:29.420]   People don't come and like it because they know you that's just not the dynamics of how Twitter works. It spreads virality
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.640]   It doesn't connect people to their friends anymore
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:38.440]   but if you have some sort of actual expertise if you're a journalist if you're a creative of some type if you're a
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.800]   politician of some type
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:48.560]   Twitter is offering you much more access to attention that you then you could get before through traditional media channels because they were just way
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   more narrow and way less
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.120]   numerous and
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:59.560]   so Twitter is playing on the attention vanity not of the average user but of the above average user and
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:04.380]   That's their whole business model. So if you're a professor with some expertise
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   You're drawn you're saying man
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.160]   I could I could
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.400]   Wait until I get citations on a paper or I could go on Twitter and I have something to say here if I'd everything
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.600]   To say no one cares
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.000]   My tweets will just go and disappear
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.240]   But I actually have something to say if I make the right takes I could get on a day-to-day basis
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.000]   This retweet and share and like and reply attention every once in a while
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.920]   Someone really famous might retweet my thing and I feel like I'm a part of this and so Twitter says we're gonna play on the attention
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:37.840]   Vanity of above-average users and by doing that they attracted a lot of above-average users people who actually were unusually creative or had a
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.240]   specific expertise is to share
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.760]   That is the whole core of what makes Twitter a compelling place for everyone else just to sit and read what's going on
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.960]   Because you have interesting people
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.240]   Since spending all their time
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.440]   Writing on there and so we talked about before earlier in the episode is one of the things that attracts content producers is I want
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:03.400]   To build an audience virality. This is the other thing that attracts especially these sort of no notable personalities. They're attracted
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.400]   it's it's attention and vanity and
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.200]   It's really good at that. And I think was a really smart move by Twitter to say
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   Forget making the average user feel like people care about them
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.480]   What we need to get is the unusually clever comedian
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.080]   We need to get when there's a pandemic a bunch of credentialed virologist. What we need to get is
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:32.800]   You know contrarian political thinkers who have a funny streak like we need these type of people who actually have some talent
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.480]   Do not focus that talent into
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:41.160]   Articles and books and occasional TV appearances and lectures put it into our platform
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.320]   so by focusing on the attention vanity of above-average users, they created a
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:54.520]   Constantly refreshed pool of above-average quality information that then the cybernetic curation algorithm could play with and now as the average user
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.560]   You're seeing all these things going by that is very engaging and very compelling
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:04.240]   It's why Twitter clones have not done nearly as well, even though the
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.000]   algorithmic and digital
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.200]   Architecture is the same then on the same pool of people so Twitter did very well there
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.800]   So anyways, Adam, I think that's what's going on
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   Is Twitter very consciously said?
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.840]   We need to make above-average users feel like they're getting more attention than they could otherwise get and then we're gonna get a lot of
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.840]   Above-average content pushed into our system and that's different than almost any other platform
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:32.080]   Most other platforms they play more on your own personal attention vanity people, you know paying attention to what you do
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.680]   I mean, that's not completely true Instagram has some Twitter vibes to it, but it also has some Facebook vibes to it
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.180]   TikTok really doesn't lean heavily into we need above-average users
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.920]   It's just we need a giant pool of content and we'll use algorithms to figure out what's going to just press your
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:51.720]   Reptilian brain buttons and make you keep looking Twitter is doing this almost uniquely and said part of what makes it so sticky
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:59.200]   All right, this is great a lot of Twitter bashing and discussion, yeah, I wasn't Twitter bashing
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.000]   I'm just that's just actually explaining. Yeah, this is why Twitter is effective. Yeah, I'm not I'm not just
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.880]   You know put it on my Twitter is bad hat. I mean, there's a reason why this is an effective platform
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.040]   All right. What do we got next?
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.240]   All right. Next questions from Bo a 38 year old teacher
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.940]   I'm not big on social media, but as an independent researcher in the humanities
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:23.500]   I use academia dot edu and research gate mainly to get access to papers
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:29.000]   I also have a Twitter and a LinkedIn account mainly to share my blog posts and see if I can find an audience
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.480]   Is this the right balance?
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.920]   Right. There's a good case study of our discussion from the deep dive earlier in the show
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:42.480]   So not knowing too much about specifically what type of research you do or your career. Let's just give some
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.920]   random recommendations here
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:51.600]   Paying for access to academic articles is a no-brainer if you are an academic who's not associated with an institution
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.760]   That gives you that access. So of course
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.560]   Twitter I don't think you need to be there
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.080]   We just talked about this
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.680]   Twitter gives you this illusion that it's going to grant you a
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.560]   Virality that will grow your audience bigger than if you hadn't had Twitter. I would say forget it just produce really good work
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.800]   Twitter may work on your behalf
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.440]   People may share your work on there and you need to have a platform you own to capture that attention
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.840]   but putting your attention in the content production on Twitter is
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.120]   going to
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.600]   Open you up to all these negatives and dilute the positives you get from your own platform LinkedIn
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   I guess it just depends what you're doing on it
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.480]   So for LinkedIn to be effective a you have to ignore
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:40.200]   The sort of increasing social features streaming distraction features and just focus on the core original
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:47.840]   Ability to use it to look at tertiary network connections. I mean the value of LinkedIn the unique value proposition of LinkedIn is
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.800]   I can look at people who are in the network of people I know
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.360]   It's not secondary but tertiary connections. That's really useful
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.520]   Right. So you say okay. I need a
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:04.440]   Connection to the movie industry. I don't know anyone in the movie industry
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.200]   but I probably know someone who knows someone in the movie industry that person can make a
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.920]   recommendation on my behalf and
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:18.560]   So it opens up contacts and because you have an intermediary who knows both ends of this link
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.400]   That's actually a high quality contact if you go out
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.040]   One more layer it doesn't work anymore
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.680]   So if it's I know someone who knows someone who knows someone in the movie industry
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.200]   That connection doesn't work because there's no person in common between you and the ultimate person you want to talk to
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.120]   So remember my longtime friend Ben Casanova who used to be Reed Hoffman's chief of staff
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.660]   I remember him at the time when LinkedIn was really taking off
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:50.520]   Explaining this network theory to me. It's it's all about this sweet spot of your friends friends is
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.920]   the sweet spot of opening yourself up to a huge amount of
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.920]   Potential connections while still having the ability to make those connections strong
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.040]   So if your work is such that as an independent researcher
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.960]   You need contracts or engagements with clients and various type of industries and you need
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.040]   Connections to people in those industries that aspect of LinkedIn could be very valuable
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.520]   So I would summarize this I guess as saying
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:22.560]   Yes to paying money to gain access to articles. No to Twitter. Maybe yes to LinkedIn if you really need it
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:29.080]   Now there's a bigger point here that I made in a New York Times op-ed that came out in
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.320]   2016 and it actually generated a lot of fewer at the time
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.340]   but I wrote this New York Times op-ed where I said we
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.240]   overestimate the value of
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.840]   social media presence in
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.280]   Getting noticed and succeeding in your career
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.760]   And I say we are forgetting the fact that these platforms are very new and most industries have been around for a very long time
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   Twitter was not used at a high rate until
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.400]   2012 to 2014
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.440]   So I was writing it up at is like this is a few years ago
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:07.640]   Before that all these industries still existed people still got noticed got hired grew reputations
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:15.920]   Grew really big careers and they did this all without Twitter followers and they did this all without being an influencer on Instagram
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.760]   so presumably
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.440]   These bespoke methods by which your work is noticed and rewarded
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.360]   Still exist in most fields that have been around for more than just a handful of years
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   So don't ignore those
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:27.880]   in fact
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:33.000]   If you ignore those and say I'm going to invent my own way to get noticed and succeed in my field based on social media
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   You're taking a huge risk
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.280]   You need to pay less attention to your Twitter followers and say in my particular field
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.160]   I'm this independent researcher and humanities who makes my money this way
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.880]   How do people traditionally get noticed and succeed almost all those channels are still there
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.640]   Social media's rise
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.280]   Which is only still just a decade old at this point of any sort of widespread adoption has not gotten rid of
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.080]   Existing channels of getting noticed and succeeding and so I keep coming back to that with people
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:06.640]   What how do people traditionally get noticed and succeed in your field and usually it involves?
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.520]   Producing really good stuff and it's really hard and has nothing to do with virality or having large follower counts
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.960]   And it's almost always that's going to be the answer
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   And so until you have a really good answer that question forget about like new tools are gonna somehow give you a shortcut
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.920]   Now when I wrote that op-ed in 2016 that caused a lot of problems. This was right before
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.200]   the
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.380]   Mainstream had turned against social media
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:40.020]   So the the political right in America had turned against social media at this point because they were worried about being censored
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.520]   But the political center and left in America was still very laudatory
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.680]   Towards social media at this point when that came out and so me standing up and saying
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:56.440]   Social media is not as important as you think for your career. You should maybe ignore that and focus on the fundamentals. It was considered a
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.560]   heretical almost
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.480]   Certifiable thing to say it really upset people
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.360]   It was whoa. No, no social media is the key. It's how you get noticed. It's how you circumvent all of these gatekeepers
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.600]   It's how you build up movements. I mean there was so much
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:18.000]   Push back really really surprised me and I've talked about this on the show before but the New York Times
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.100]   Commissioned the next week a response op-ed. They got the social media manager of monster.com
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:30.700]   Patrick someone Patrick Gilroy to write a response op-ed to mine and say this is crazy. Don't listen to this
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.780]   A lot of articles were written in response to mine. This is crazy. Don't listen to this
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:40.780]   I had hostile radio interviews like how can you believe this now? I understand this mechanism because we see it all the time in
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:47.540]   2022 2023 we see this all the time. Where is the fiercest pushback?
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:54.820]   Generated this sort of when you get these type of big pylons generated. It's not when someone comes from left field
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.700]   From the completely other team and throw some rocks. You're used to that
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.780]   It's when someone who you feel like is in or close to your tribe
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.820]   Pushes a little bit to the edge
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.540]   Then it's seen a little bit more like heresy and that has to be policed
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:15.160]   so if you know 2016 Jaron Lanier stands up and says
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.240]   Social media is nonsense people like that's Jaron Lanier
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.820]   I mean, he's like kind of crazy and brilliant and this is what he's been saying for a long time and we know it
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:22.940]   It's not a big deal
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.820]   But if a computer scientist
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:31.140]   Comes out and says that someone who is in sort of mainstream thought someone who has some influence with an audience someone who's sort of
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.620]   A part of that sort of mainstream centrist or leftist inner tribe comes out and says I don't think that's that important
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.980]   You have to fiercely
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:43.620]   At the time you have to fiercely police that to prevent the Overton window from shifting away from the direction you wanted the ship
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:49.680]   so it was a it was an interesting example of what became much more prevalent in the years that followed the sort of
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.140]   policing of views and
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.560]   This became a increasingly political after a while
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.500]   So the left and the right would do this on political hot topics, but this was less political
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.900]   but it was just more there's this mainstream intellectual thought that social media was this
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:10.200]   Powerful force that toppled dictators and helped Barack Obama get elected and it was very meaningful important
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.080]   And so if you're involved in this sort of mainstream intellectual life
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:19.380]   They did not like someone starting to veer off the reservation now. Everyone's like a course
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.940]   Yeah, everyone agrees with it now, but it was interesting
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:30.260]   So there's like an early mild pile on but it showed a general internet dynamic that I think has really strengthened ever since then
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.300]   So you wrote that before the like button got introduced, right?
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:38.780]   Like now the like button actually got introduced earlier. Okay. Yes the like button got introduced
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.940]   Like 2007 or eight or something like that. All right, right. Yeah. Yeah
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.940]   the interesting thing was when I wrote that it was right this at the turning point in the
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.220]   mainstream intellectual
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:57.420]   Thought on social media was Donald Trump getting elected and that's ultimately what turned it is the shift from
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:02.020]   Facebook helping Barack Obama to Facebook helping Trump
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:07.260]   Shifted I think the reception of social media and it opened up like a lot more skepticism
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:13.400]   Hostility towards a platform from the center and left the the hostility from the right was already there. I started hearing that like
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.740]   2015 so that was already there
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.780]   But from the center and the left that was after the Trump election, but it wasn't
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.540]   immediate because that op-ed
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:31.020]   That op-ed came out the in the Sunday in the New York Times in the week in review the Sunday after Donald Trump was elected
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:36.340]   Mmm, so it wasn't an immediate response. I mean it was a week in review section. That was
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:41.500]   That and like a bunch of political stuff and then the next week they had the follow-up
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:47.900]   Right. So in the first the last months of 2016 early months of 2017
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.420]   There still was a general positive
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:57.640]   Consensus on social media. It wasn't really told the Cambridge Analytica and the Russian disinformation stories when those really took off
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:03.260]   Which was more to thought after Trump was in office in 2017. That's when he began to see the shift
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.500]   So I know it's an interesting time point
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:11.100]   So really the shift towards universal negativity towards social media was probably first or second quarter
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.620]   2017. Mm-hmm
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.800]   If not all the way around it, you had to get all the way to like 2018 really before
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:23.460]   Yeah, but then by the time I was promoting digital minimalism in 2019 the pushback
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.420]   I was getting from reporters is like why aren't you pushing for even harder, you know?
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.720]   Regulations and shutting down these companies. So yeah, man that thing flipped nothing flipped hard
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.300]   All right, let's uh, we have time. Let's do one more question here. All right
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.460]   Next questions from Alta a 22 year old software engineer
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:48.300]   Do federated social media networks such as Mastodon stand a chance against centralized ones such as Twitter?
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.340]   We don't we don't need Mastodon. I mean, I'm fine for Mastodon to exist, but the
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.900]   part of the premise of Mastodon is
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:02.200]   We want Twitter, but just without stuff. We don't like I mean, it's the it's the same interface as Twitter. It's the same
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.460]   Paradigm of Twitter these short tweets that go to people who?
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:12.500]   Follow you and my bigger argument is this Twitter format is not that fundamental. I
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.600]   Mean we have websites. We have blogs. We have WordPress we have
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:24.100]   Podcasts we have the ability to independently produce and post video and host and have it be watched on all these devices
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.220]   we have all these other means of
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.660]   producing
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:33.500]   Content independently without it having to live in a massive ecosystem where we don't control it anymore
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.620]   So we don't actually need a Twitter clone
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:40.340]   That's fine. If like there is a Twitter clone of Mastodon takes off, but we don't need it to I
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:43.340]   Think we became so myopic in
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:49.780]   Recent years because we got so used to the dominance of these platform monopolies that our vision of what the internet mean
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.700]   Means became confined to it means Instagram and it means Twitter
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.640]   The Internet was a lot more than that
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:02.580]   So getting away from these platform monopolies, it's not just let's just have Twitter but not have it be owned by one person
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:06.540]   It's we don't need a Twitter clone at all. We we are already
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:12.440]   Developing independent alternatives to this that are way more successful than the Mastodon. That's why I mentioned podcasting
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.700]   That's why I mentioned individual WordPress. I think email newsletters
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.340]   all of these are examples of
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.500]   independently produced
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:25.260]   Media content being produced where you control much more of the eyeballs you control your audience
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:31.860]   And this is all working a lot better Mastodon. It's not working that well because you know Twitter turns out that why does that format work?
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.060]   It works if you have a massive retweet network
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.980]   That can be very good at
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:45.860]   Virally spreading information in the cybernetic curation paradigm that we've been talking about and you have a really huge amount of above-average users
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:51.420]   Constantly pumping information to be evaluated by the cybernetic curation algorithm. That's what makes Twitter interesting
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.340]   Not that you can post short things and see it on a timeline
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:56:00.220]   And so this is why a Mastodon federated server doesn't really do so well. It's because you don't have that massive
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.700]   Network that does the really effective curation
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:09.260]   You don't have all the best comedians and thinkers and politicians outrageous people all these people putting all this attention into it to generate really good
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:15.220]   Content so you end up with 70 guys on a Mastodon server saying boring things and then they get bored and just ban each other
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:20.260]   So we have alternatives to the platform monopolies
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.880]   But they don't look like the platforms and I think that's actually I think that's actually good
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.580]   All right, well what I want to do is
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:36.460]   Move on now to our something interesting segment before I get there. However, let me briefly mention another
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:43.420]   Sponsor that makes this podcast possible another product that I use every single day and that is our friends at
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.140]   Hinson shaving
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.660]   So I've talked about this product before
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   Hinson produces a
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.180]   beautifully constructed
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.700]   precision engineered aluminum razor
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:57:03.780]   Hinson's main business is manufacturing precision aerospace parts. They have these giant CNC router machines that can do incredibly
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:10.000]   Accurate metal shaping and so they built this beautiful very sturdy metal
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.060]   razor
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:16.300]   That when you put just a 10 cent safety blade in there and screw it in it
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:22.580]   Gives you just a teeny bit of the blade peeking out on either side. I have the actual measurement here point
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.500]   0.0013 inches is all that sticks out past the edge of
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:33.220]   The razor so that allows you to get a shave without the diving board effect you get if the blade sticks out too far
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.140]   Without the diving board effect you get a close shave without the nicks without it getting caught
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:44.460]   So you you pay more up front for this beautiful metal razor, but then you pay very little for the blades you put in there
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.860]   so it doesn't take long before it is cheaper to be using a
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:53.020]   Hinson's razor than it is to use a subscription service or to buy them at the drugstore
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.380]   Because you're only spending 10 cents per blade once you have the really nice
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:01.660]   Beautifully manufactured piece of equipment. So I like tools that are made really well
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.400]   I like tools that over time are cheaper to operate. So I shave with my Hinson
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:12.180]   Razor, so it's time to say no to subscriptions and expensive drugstore
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:17.820]   Purchases and instead say yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime visit Hinson shaving comm slash cow
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:24.740]   To pick the razor for you and use code cow and you'll get two years worth of blades free with your razor
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:28.460]   Just make sure you add that to your supply of blades to your cart
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.500]   And then when you type in the promo code cow the price will drop to zero
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:37.340]   That's 100 free blades when you head to HEN S O N S H A V I N G
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.220]   comm slash cow and use that code cow I
[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:48.680]   Also want to talk about our friends at mint mobile if saving more and spending less is one of your top goals for 2023
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:53.940]   Why are you still paying insane amounts of money every month for your phone bill?
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:59:00.300]   Switching to mint mobile is the easiest way to save this year as the first company to sell premium wireless service online
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:04.580]   Only mint mobile lets you order from home and save a ton with phone plans starting at just
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:09.580]   $15 a month. I actually was talking about mint mobile
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:15.340]   I put it in a a talk I was invited to give at my kids schools about smartphones and kids and
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:21.360]   One of the things that comes up in this conversation is how do we give our kids the ability to text message us?
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.680]   Without having to give them a fully featured smartphone
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:29.940]   Mint mobile is actually one of the things I talk about in this lecture
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:34.580]   I'm giving because it makes it really easy. You can go on to Amazon buy a feature phone
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.260]   So a flip phone they can still do text messages
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:41.260]   But not the internet you buy it for whatever 70 bucks and then just get one of these
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.380]   $15 a month fully featured wireless plans for mint mobile you do it online
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.460]   They send you a SIM card you stick it in your phone and now for a very small price
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:55.400]   Your kids have the ability to text you to pick you up from practice or to say they got on the bus safely or whatever
[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.220]   This is what I like about this. It makes it cheap and easy to get texting to get calls
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.620]   To get data. So you have a lot more flexibility. You can have multiple plans. You can have multiple phones
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:11.700]   So anyways to get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get that plan shipped right to your door for free
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:18.960]   Go to mint mobile comm slash deep. That's mint mobile comm slash deep cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at mint
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.740]   mobile comm
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:24.620]   Slash deep and that's mint. M. I n T
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:31.940]   I'm thinking Jesse about you know, I wrote this whole talk for my kids school, but I'm thinking I put a lot of work in
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.540]   These slides maybe we'll record a version of the talk right here in the studio
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.520]   Yeah, just put it up on you know YouTube for because people care about this
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.140]   What should I do with my kids and?
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:46.780]   Smartphones and I've gone deep into this research and have a lot of thoughts on I know some of these researchers who are involved in
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.860]   It and I have this sort of big slide that goes all these slides to go through it all
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.540]   So if that's of interest let us know
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:57.780]   I think I might at some point record a version of that talk and just put it out there in the world for anyone to
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.580]   See yeah, that'd be cool. It's interesting topic
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.740]   Alright, so let's switch to something interesting
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:09.660]   This is where we take interesting things that people sent to my interesting at Cal Newport comm address
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:14.980]   We like to just look at these two in the show on something cool. So I actually have two things. I want to mention today
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.700]   The first thing is a new podcast
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.420]   That just launched it's a pushkin industries podcast that's hosted by
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.060]   podcaster extraordinaire Justin Richmond
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.980]   Justin Richmond is one of these
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:37.060]   Super pros in the industry. He came out. He came up through the NPR system working on some of their major shows and
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.180]   NPR podcast and came over the pushkin where he's a producer
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.780]   he also co-hosted a music podcast on pushkin with Malcolm Gladwell and
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:49.300]   Rick Rubin anyways, he has a new podcast out called
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:55.340]   Started from the bottom and I thought it was a really cool idea. So I just wanted to mention it here
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:00.240]   So what he does on this show Justin interviews people with humble origins
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.080]   Who managed to scale the summit of success people who are outsiders?
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:11.140]   People not part of the old boys network people who grew up in a world where almost nobody went to college and he asked how
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.900]   Did they beat the odds?
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.660]   Lets you to hear their stories in their own words
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:19.340]   I'm fascinated as you know about this topic about how people
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.460]   Succeed in various endeavors and I think by focusing on people who had very few advantages
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:30.760]   You're distilling in some sense some of the necessary core drives that goes behind success. So it's a really cool show
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.640]   some of the early episodes feature people such as Charlemagne the God
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   Susie Orman and the MFA champion Francis and Gano
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.940]   You know, I've actually crossed paths with Charlemagne a couple times
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.460]   I've been on his radio show the breakfast club
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:54.380]   Or I think I still hold the record for the whitest geekiest person to ever be on that show
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.980]   But Charlemagne worries a lot about the impact of social media on young people. So there's a cool interview
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.180]   I also went on his comedy central show. He had a TV show
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.120]   I've been a guest on that show as before very thoughtful really interesting guys
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.300]   Francis and Gano, I don't know but I just know he's terrifying
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:16.340]   A terrifying MFA fighter. So Francis all I can say is I incredibly respect you. Please don't kill me
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:23.020]   You know, it's sound like a cool show started from the bottom. You can find that wherever you get your podcast
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.100]   The other cool thing I wanted to talk about
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.740]   It's something that's happening in Australia
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.460]   But I think it's reflecting
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:38.960]   More a broader trend. So I'm gonna pull up an article here on the screen. It's just loading. Okay, Jesse
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.900]   Yep. All right. This is an article from the Guardian
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:48.340]   Labor and Greens senators back four-day
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:54.460]   Work week, so I have it on the screen if you're watching at youtube.com slash Caliper media episode
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.820]   241 so what's happening here is you have
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.580]   Australian senators
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:08.120]   Beginning to back legislation that would make a four-day workweek at full pay something like a standard
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:14.700]   This topic is coming up a lot in a lot of different places all throughout Europe. For example similar discussions are
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:20.860]   Happening and I just think the four-day workweek in general is something to keep an eye on
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:26.980]   And it's interesting. I think that Australia is starting to get more serious about this. It's something to keep an eye on
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.300]   My feelings about it are mixed
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.240]   They're they're mixed, you know
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.700]   I just did an interview with reporter on the four-day workweek and I was relatively actually negative because I was the mood I was in
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:43.900]   I did that interview, but I think mixed is the right way to describe how I'm thinking about it. So pros and cons on
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.340]   the con side, I think it is
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:51.180]   Stepping aside because you don't want to deal with complexity the real issues
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.680]   And the real issues is not that people think that there's too many days during the week in which they're going to work
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:02.700]   It's the nature of their work itself and for knowledge workers in particular it is overload
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.860]   Overload is creating all these problems
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:09.900]   There's a lot of psychic damage that's done by having too much work on your plate and just saying Friday is no longer
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.380]   Officially a workday doesn't get rid of that overload doesn't get rid of that psychic damage
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.900]   You end up still working that day
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:19.900]   Anyways, you still are paying that tax of all the overhead of all these all these different tasks on your plate
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.780]   That means you can spend less time on the actual work itself and it piles up more and all these negative things
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:28.820]   Don't go away by just turning the knob on the number of days in the week that you work
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.940]   This is different. Of course the industrial sector where the main knob you had
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:38.660]   Was the number amount of time you work if I am putting steering wheels on a car in a Ford plant?
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:45.580]   the only variable that is going to now affect that experience is just how many hours am I doing that and
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.860]   So in the early 20th century when we get something like the Fair Labor Standards Act
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:56.540]   From the 1930s that put in place to five day workweek. It made a lot of sense. This is the knob we need to turn
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.900]   What is the reasonable amount of days in the knowledge sector in the 21st century?
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:04.380]   It's not the not the issue the issue some it's not so much how many hours is your workday?
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:07.780]   It's how much work is on your plate. So that's my that's my trepidation
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:13.620]   Around the four-day workweek is it's kicking the can to the side. It's not actually tackling with what matters on
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:17.780]   The other hand we have an interesting data point
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:24.980]   That comes from the company base camp who switches to a four-day workweek for part of the year every year
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.540]   And it's an interesting data point and what they found is
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:31.500]   Reducing the total number of days at least temporarily
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:38.300]   Creates a scarcity mindset that does actually reduce time wasting it reduces long meetings
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:44.700]   People are less likely to call a meeting people get a little bit more focused on what's important because it creates a sense of scarcity
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:49.380]   We don't have as much time. So, you know what? Let's not do this. Let's remain more focused. So actually
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.780]   It created a better working environment
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.820]   There was a lot of negative feedback when base camp first did this experiment
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.500]   And I document this and I think this is maybe in deep work
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.260]   I talked about this or potentially world without email there was pushback at first. It said oh you're just gonna make people
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.140]   take five days of work and squeeze it into four and
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:16.500]   The co-founder CEO Jason Fried responded. That's not what's happening. People are actually reducing their work when there's less days, so it's possible
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.780]   that the four-day workweek will
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:25.260]   Directly improve things it will be an indirect side effect because of a sense of scarcity
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:29.780]   People will actually pull back what they think is a reasonable amount of work to assign
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:37.180]   there's also some other obvious benefits such as if Friday is not a workday, even though you still might be answering emails all day and
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:43.860]   Feel like you have too much to do. It'll become socially acceptable not to have meetings. That's another day without meetings. That's useful
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.500]   There's a flexibility benefit
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:51.620]   Of course any day you have off in an official sense is a day where you're more flexible to do things like go to the doctor
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.700]   Take your car to the shop go to your kids school. So there's these sort of smaller
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.660]   direct benefits and perhaps a larger indirect benefit on
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.300]   work
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:07.480]   But I still think the conversation we have to have is about the details of the nature of knowledge work
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:14.100]   The what makes knowledge work hard what's burning out knowledge workers today is not as
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.700]   Simple as a question as it was a hundred years ago
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.820]   Where you had two things to make sure the conditions were safe and the hours were reasonable
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:29.060]   Knowledge work is different and we have to introduce more knobs to turn but it's really hard and we don't want to do it
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:34.660]   So we focus on the simple things. So I'm just mixed on this. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.660]   There might be some benefits. There might be some drawbacks
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:43.700]   But it's not getting at the heart of what I think is actually causing problems in the knowledge sector today, but it's interesting
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   So I want to show you that article
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:51.660]   These links of course are in the show notes. You can also find a summary of all the questions and everything else in there
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:58.020]   But let's wrap it up. So thank you everyone who sent in your questions. Thank you for listening
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.860]   We'll be back next week with a new episode of the podcast and until then as always
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.700]   Stay deep
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.280]   (upbeat music)
