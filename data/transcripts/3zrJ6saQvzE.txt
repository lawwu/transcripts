[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   All right, let's do a, Oh, here's another podcasting question. Okay.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.760]   Got a podcasting question here. I'm going to pontificate a little bit. So caveat emptier
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.520]   before we do a couple more sponsors. Okay. This question comes from Paula.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   Paula says, I really enjoy your episodes on the business of podcasting and its trends.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.320]   When I was looking for information on starting my own podcast,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.880]   it seemed like a lot of the materials out there were focused on podcast as marketing tools.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.640]   Ways to do quick, easy production with lots of episodes as a content rich way to show off your
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.680]   expertise. I'm more interested in podcasting as the audio equivalent of long form,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.720]   nonfiction narrative writing like a planet money or Freakonomics.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.840]   Paula notes in parentheses that she is an economist herself.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.200]   So that's why she was using Freakonomics as an example.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.640]   Paula goes on to say, I see the value in all these formats, but if the low barrier to start
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.440]   promotional style podcast, fill the directories, does that turn off the potential audience to
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.600]   other styles? Do they step into the podcast world, get overwhelmed, see a lot of styles
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.560]   they don't like and that feel very amateur and leave for amateurs interested in other styles?
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.720]   Does their entryway become working with an established production company like in traditional
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.920]   publishing thoughts? All right, Paula, I love pontificating on podcasting as a business.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   I have a few thoughts here. Number one, I think it's important to have a good
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.120]   number one. No, I don't think the proliferation of the sort of low quality checklist productivity
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   style marketing podcast is going to hurt other more serious attempts at podcasting
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.400]   by checklist productivity, by the way, that's my that's my reference to the genre of productivity
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.360]   that says if you just have the right insider information.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.840]   The right steps. And just go through and execute these steps, you can accomplish these big,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.480]   really interesting things like you want to just work, you want to triple your income and work a
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.080]   fraction of your time, just have the right checklist to go through. And at the other end
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.440]   of that, you'll you'll accomplish that goal. You want a podcast that's going to be a great
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   marketing tool for your company. The key is going through these checklists. That's checklist
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.200]   productivity for anything that is. Desirable for any type of outcome that a lot of people
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.800]   would want. Checklist are never enough. They're really appealing because it's tractable. I put
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.600]   in a little bit of effort, I make my way through the list, you feel like you're making progress,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.120]   but things that are hard are hard and checklist aren't enough. Anyways, there's a lot of checklist
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.240]   productivity out there for marketing podcasts, you get a bunch of these podcasts that no one
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.480]   ever listens to. Because it's people just talking about whatever their industry is in a way that no
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.080]   one would care about. I don't think that hurts other people making a more serious run. podcasting
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.880]   is developed enough, there's enough podcast out there, people aren't just perusing directories
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.480]   to see what they want to listen to. It's more like radio shows or TV shows on streamers. Now
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.200]   people hear about things through trusted sources, a friend recommends it, they hear someone on
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.000]   another show, a show is spotlighted on one of these top charts or spotlights that let's say
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   like an apple or Spotify does, that's how people find podcasts now. So the fact that a lot of crap
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.040]   is out there, I don't think it's a problem. All right, number two, you ask, should you work with
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   a production company, that's not really going to be that's not an entryway. So there's not,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.840]   there's not production companies out there that will say, you know, Paula, like you seem like
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.760]   you're smart and interesting, we'll build this podcast around you. And like, you'll find a big
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.120]   audience. There are production companies, but who they tend to work with is either established
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.680]   podcasts or established figures. So like an established, well known writer, and they will
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.040]   say you have a big audience, we will, will help you build the podcast around it. But often what
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.280]   they're really offering there is technical expertise. So there's not, there's not an entryway
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.400]   in the podcasting like you would have in publishing, where if you have the right idea, the
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.240]   right publisher might get behind it, and you can just focus on the writing and it could take off.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.080]   podcasting requires a lot more from the, you know, the actual podcaster has to build a show
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.840]   that builds an audience. All right, so that's my second. Third,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   I don't quite know how to develop this theory. But see, I see a direct line,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.360]   I think blogging and podcasting are connected. Social media, which emerged between blogging
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.160]   and podcasting is a very different beast. And it warped. It's my pontification, everyone should be
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.960]   aware, it warped our understanding of democratized digital content production. Here's what I mean
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.600]   about that. When blogging came along and blogging as at the as the, the rear guard action of the web
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.880]   in general web 2.0, the ability for the average person to be able to publish text that's accessible
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.600]   around the world without having to have access to a magazine or to a newspaper or to a book press,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.320]   this revolution, this democratizing of text in the digital, in the digital setting that
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.920]   sort of reached its apotheosis with the blog. This was an important revolution.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.400]   But most blogs did terribly. Because it turns out, here's what happens when you use digital
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:22.160]   tools to democratize different media channels. It allows many more people to get in and take a swing.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.200]   But what it doesn't do is lower the bar of quality of originality for success.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.880]   So it's a good thing for the culture writ large, because there's lots of diverse voices
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.360]   or interesting voices or, or styles or ideas that, that never really would have got a shot
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.760]   to get above that bar if they had to write for life magazine and try to get in there
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.520]   blogging minute was possible that you, you could take your shot. No, one's going to hold you back.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.760]   So it's good for the culture writ large, because you get a more interesting,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.840]   more innovation, more interesting set of writers, but for the individual, it can seem frustrating
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.360]   because 99.9% of individuals aren't producing stuff at the bar that it matters. So when you,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.160]   this is the, the, a key mistake of the democratization of digital media that people
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.040]   often make democratizing access to the media does not reduce the quality bar relate required to
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.080]   succeed. So we get this standard pushback around blogging when that happens. Like, well, most blogs
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.240]   are bad. So this isn't changing publishing, but it did. Yes, of course, most blogs are bad,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.120]   but there was a lot of good ones. And it brought a lot of people into the, into the industry that
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.000]   might've otherwise not. And it innovated the form. And, and, you know, you have the whole,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.600]   like just even in politics, even the whole wonk approach to understanding politics and wonk blog,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.240]   and you had Ezra Klein and Nate silver, and all of this came out of blogging these voices that,
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.800]   you know, would have otherwise had to have worked their way up through newsrooms and the
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.960]   traditional political reporting. Podcasting is very similar. It's democratizing digital audio.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   Now, almost anyone like me can put together a show and have it out there and it can leap across
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   the uncanny Valley between the internet and terrestrial radio that we're used to. And,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.440]   and you can be in the same ecosystem and almost anyone can do this now. And this is all great for
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.320]   the whole culture because you have a lot of innovation happening, but for the individual
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.880]   is still hard because the quality bar is still really high to produce an audio program that a
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   lot of people want to listen to is really hard. It's like why most radio shows failed.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   It's why the people who were great at it, the Howard Stearns of the world, the Dave Ramsey of
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.800]   the world make a lot of money. It's really hard to do. Now, why I talked about social media being
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.320]   a divergence is because social media warped our understanding of this democratization of digital
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:44.160]   media because it didn't just democratize access to various media. They played these weird algorithmic
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.840]   games with attention. And I talk about this some in deep work, a little bit in digital minimalism
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   as well, but it had more of a, for lack of a better word, collectivist model of attention,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.120]   where it not just gave everyone access to publish. We had that before,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.560]   but it gave everyone access to some attention. Now it used to be in the early days
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.520]   of social media back when it was really based on the social graph, the way this unfolded was
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.840]   you would post things and your friends would look at what you posted and they would give you
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.560]   comments on it and you would do the same for them. And now you could kind of post stuff and have,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.000]   and you could have attention. Hey, look, here's a picture. I went to the farm or here's what I was
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.520]   up to today, or here's a little quip and people give you attention. Hey, good work. That looks
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.320]   beautiful or whatever. And if you had tried to post any of that on a blog, like no one would
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.440]   have come. There wasn't a collectivization of attention there that wasn't going to attract
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.040]   an audience. And if God forbid you had a newspaper column where you were just posting these
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.840]   observations, you know, the paper would have fired you on day two, but social media added this new
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.960]   artificial attention redistribution, which is really what people want is the attention.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.080]   So it used to just be this implicit contract between friends. I'll post stuff. Let's be honest,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.600]   garbage. You'll post kind of garbage, but we'll all talk about each other's garbage and we'll all
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.080]   feel like we have an audience. Then things got more sophisticated. And by the time you get to
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.600]   something like TikTok, now you have just direct manipulation of attention redistribution where
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.000]   they will take something you post occasionally and show it to a lot of people. So that from your
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.520]   perspective, you were getting these intermittent, hard to predict, giant burst of reinforcement
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.880]   that make you feel like, my God, like that really took off. Maybe I'm really close to breaking out.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.520]   When I was writing at Bevco yesterday at the coffee shop near where I record this podcast,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.000]   there was a two gen Z-ers on, I might've been a date. I don't know. It sounded like a date,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.600]   like a first date. And they were just going back and forth about TikTok and like, well,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.880]   I had this one video and you don't have these views and that's just pure manipulation of
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.640]   attention. So now it used to be an implicit contract between friends on sharing a network.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.880]   And now just the algorithms do it itself. I think that warped people's understanding of
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:03.040]   success in media and made it feel like more just your personal expression and observations of the
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   world are always just, you know, one Mr. Beast breakthrough away from you suddenly having a big
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.760]   audience that everyone has the potential, potentially having a big audience. And you
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.680]   get just enough reinforcement, you this trickle of online reinforcement that you're used to it.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.880]   And then you go back to the non-manipulated pitiless media world of podcasting,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.600]   just like blogs were before it. And just like traditional media was before that and it's
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.120]   crickets. So Paul, I've wandered way off your original question. I just think this is interesting
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.120]   that, that we have these two points going on here. If we're going to just pontificate again about
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   media, democratization of digital media, democratized access to publishing your voice.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.960]   It did not lower the bar of quality required to succeed with an audience, but social media
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.280]   collectivized or redistributed attention in a manipulative manner to keep people using it.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.480]   And retrain people to expect and think, you know, if you're just out there and you're interesting,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.080]   you never know. So that all goes to say, Paul, back to your plan to start a podcast.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.120]   It's just hard. You know, it's just a, it's a very competitive pitiless landscape. You have
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.840]   to have something that's going to have a large audience say this. I have to listen to it. It
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.840]   is a hard world out there. This show does pretty well. It's not a super successful show. It does
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.320]   pretty well. And it is really hard work to get there. We put a lot of effort into this and look,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.120]   I have a large audience. I've been writing books for a long time. I'm published all around the
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.320]   world. I I've been around, I've been known, I've been thinking and talking professionally about
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.440]   these things for well over a decade. And we work really hard, Jesse and I, to try to make the show
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.000]   tighter and tighter. We have a good audience, but it's not massive. I'm just saying it's hard work.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.280]   It's hard work. You got to think about it like a large FM radio station or cable news channel
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.560]   hired you to put together a show and how hard you would have to work to try to make that show a
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.120]   success. That's the way to think about it. Don't let the artificial redistribution of attention
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.400]   that's been leveraged by social media, warp your understanding of what actually goes into success.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.360]   Here.
