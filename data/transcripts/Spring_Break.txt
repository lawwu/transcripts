[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.400]   Hey radicals, this is Josh Rascheitz.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   Just a quick note of announcement to say that Radical Personal Finance will be on spring
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.840]   break for the next few weeks.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.560]   I want to let you know that I do have a couple of interviews pre-recorded and I'm going to
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.480]   release one or two shows where I've been featured on somebody else's podcast and in the interim
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.400]   until we get back to the regularly scheduled programming, I encourage you to check out
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.400]   the archives.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.320]   The full archives are available on the Radical Personal Finance app, all the episodes going
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640]   back to episode one.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   If you haven't listened to the past archives, I'd encourage you to go back and look through
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.000]   the titles and see if there might be some shows that you'll find useful.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.120]   The philosophy here at Radical Personal Finance is to try to hit most major topics only once.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.760]   Even though you might have to deal with a few more ums and ahs and a little bit less
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   of a polished delivery in the earlier shows, I think you'll find a lot of good information
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   there.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.840]   I know hundreds of people have emailed me and told me they've found a great deal of
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.960]   value in the archives of the show.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.880]   So when I get back from spring break, we will resume our regularly scheduled programming,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.000]   look for some sporadic episodes being released over the next few weeks and in the meantime,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   enjoy the archives.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.640]   Again, all 320-ish episodes, I had to look to see which one this is, all about 320 episodes
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.400]   available in the archives on the free Radical Personal Finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.440]   The LA Kings Holiday Pack is back!
