[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.720]   One is that there is a long historical record
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.580]   of them doing well.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.220]   And it's not just, oh, in the US over the last 40 years,
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.460]   it's had a good return.
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.940]   There was a study by this group of economists.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.660]   They wrote this book called "Triumph of the Optimists."
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.700]   And they did this huge study over 20 countries,
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.900]   over 100 years of history.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.140]   And they found over the 100 years,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.140]   on average global equities beat inflation by 5%.
