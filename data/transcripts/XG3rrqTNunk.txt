[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   all right everyone welcome to the official unofficial grace point podcast good to have
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.880]   you guys back i'm steven i'm isaiah and we are your co-hosts um so we are um we realized we
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.780]   jumped into this podcast i mean we don't know what we're doing clearly no yeah no idea um getting a
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.940]   lot of great tips and stuff like that but um we realized that we kind of jumped to this whole
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.440]   thing talking about how we're a weird church and that makes sense if you've been to our church and
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.920]   or you've been our church a long time stuff like that but actually you don't really know our church
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.420]   you're just getting kind of wow this is a weird church yeah you only saw all the weird aspects of
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.280]   us so yeah my brother was like i think you made us seem weirder than we actually are which was not our
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.600]   intention but looking back i can see how that's the case not a good first impression yeah so we felt
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.100]   like okay let's let's just go back a little bit backtrack zoom out a little bit yeah what the
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.480]   heck is this thing called grace point yeah who are we yeah and uh what makes us tick i think what we
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.600]   wanted to focus on so last episode was what makes us weird this episode is what makes us tick you know
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.540]   what are we passionate about and i think um if there's one slogan that really captures it um it's
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.320]   an axe to church in every college town yeah i mean that's that that motto slogan whatever it is that
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.920]   tagline is what's sort of animated us the last 10 years and yeah if you come to our building it's
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.780]   like it's posted on the walls website everything watch a video isaiah yells it at you in his
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.780]   narrations book words yeah i don't i don't do that because i want to really it's very stirring though
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.620]   i'm very thankful you thank you thank you steven you're welcome okay anyway moving on so we're just
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.760]   gonna um we're just gonna unpack that slogan and just kind of talk about like each part of it or
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.320]   aspects of it um that really kind of explain and capture who we are yeah yeah um and so actually
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.400]   maybe go backwards like acts two church in every college town okay so college and usually we think
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.640]   about college ministries reaching college students thinking about parachurch ministries like intervarsity
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.720]   crew you know navigators like all great great ministries um you don't think about a church though
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   so how did that happen how did we end up was it like a grand strategy you know like yeah college you
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.700]   know that's how it was for those parachurch organizations you know not quite like that for
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.880]   us yeah so well so i can take this um this section of it because i was here for a while um so i i think
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.160]   most of the people even people who are like kind of staff a lot of them don't fully know the history of
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.560]   our church so it might be helpful to just tell it let's just tell the story and i i've heard it like a
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.240]   a million times and i still tell you i still ask you like yeah yeah yeah so um so yeah just to be
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.560]   up front this is our history so the story begins in 1981 when a korean couple um their names were
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.060]   becky and paul they started a church called berkland and it was called berkland because it was on the
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.300]   border of berkeley and oakland so henson and berkland berkland baptist church so bbc so you hear that phrase
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.520]   sometimes and they started a church on the berkeley campus for college students and that was always their
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.940]   vision they came out of another group that was also about college ministry um and so yeah they
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.360]   they they founded so the founders were not pastor and kelly yeah that surprised me when yeah oh i didn't
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.760]   know that yeah contrary to uh common uh belief they my parents actually didn't come to our church i think
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.900]   until like 1986 your dad knew like people but then he didn't even go there as an undergrad yeah so back
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.860]   in the day the korean christian community at berkeley was pretty small so they were all kind of friends so
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.860]   like his best friend was part of berkeley as well as like his best friend's younger brother who he was
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.420]   also very close to and a bunch of others um and so but my dad uh for just various reasons started coming
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.300]   to berkeley after graduation and um him and those other friends and and the leader couple were kind of
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.980]   the first generation of leaders of that church a lot of them became pastors a lot of them are still
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.500]   pastors this day at other berkeley churches bbc churches um but around 2006 not around 2006 2006
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.340]   um the whole bbc which by that time was kind of a network of churches kind of similar to what grace
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.980]   point is today um decided to split go autonomous um so that it wouldn't be a network anymore and so our
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.940]   church became grace point what it is today incorporated as a new organization um and that became kind of i don't
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.820]   know in some ways that's the start i guess of our like modern history as grace point um so that was
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.380]   when i was in high school right right yeah and i came in i didn't know any of this as a freshman right
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.620]   when did you find out about them just curious when and how do you remember gosh uh i think it was like
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.220]   my freshman year and like your this q a session which we do all the time and your dad started talking
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060]   about like our history and then started talking about some of the online criticism and stuff and i was like
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.860]   like oh what the you know and i went on a like i've said in other uh episodes um i i went on the
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.260]   you know saw all this online stuff and i was like whoa this is not my experience whatever yeah and then
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.660]   i just oh so that's how you've heard about the whole bbc history yeah yeah a little bit that's i mean and
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.820]   then i heard a fuller history from you know your parents and stuff like that um and from you as well
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:12.580]   um but like i think what i was intrigued by when i heard it was how like and this is maybe the other
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.380]   aspect of the motto which is like acts to church in college like how does that fit together like it when
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.780]   i i i think i have to say when i came i was like wow this is brilliant like i was really impressed by by
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.180]   just the faithfulness everyone the culture everything and i was like how did you guys like set out to do
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.780]   this like how did you and the answer was like we didn't set out to do this it all happened by accident
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.260]   you know and that was to me that was a pleasant surprise yeah and it seemed like during even before
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.620]   i was there during those days that that kind of because it was a college context and you're you're
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.020]   with each other all the time and college is that great flattening of just like social structures
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.660]   where like people you know it doesn't matter what background you're from and stuff like that
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.980]   you're just living in the same dorm room and you're just close right and then you see each other and
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.900]   then so there was that and then kind of you had to come to the homogeneity maybe a little bit of
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.540]   just being korean and asian whatever i'm sure it was close it was just really close and i remember
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.820]   hearing like first thing it came to our church like i've known this guy for 25 years i've never heard
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.980]   that at a church and so that stuck with me i was kind of in a place where what god was talking to me
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.300]   about at the time was about covenantal relationships actually because i kind of noticed that i wasn't like
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.940]   that just my friends were like going to high school they're all crying and i was like why you guys didn't
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.860]   know this was going to happen like i was kind of cold going to college yeah so i just noted that
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.780]   even my non-christian friends knew something about relationships that i didn't and i need to learn
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.540]   that and then i stumbled across grace point it's like we've known each other for 25 years i was like
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.860]   okay i think there's something here right so that what i've heard is like you're just living like
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.540]   you you lived in college you didn't really graduate you still went over each other's houses and yeah
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.660]   in some ways it was kind of intentional in the sense that there was kind of a turning point around i
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.660]   think around like the late 80s where kind of some of the some of like the younger staff as well as like
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.500]   some of like the seniors and stuff started talking to each other actually and saying stuff like you know
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.900]   what like what we've got here you know and i mean college is a special time where yeah it just lends
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.380]   itself to the pattern of acts two um where you're seeing each other every day yeah kind of whether
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.940]   you like it or not you're stuck within these like dorms you're seeing each other and you know you don't
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.660]   have much possession so like money and there's no like difference in social status so just in some
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.780]   ways it's like if there's any place where it's easy to experience and actually live at acts two
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.180]   it's going to be in college and people had been experiencing that as undergrads and there kind of
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.020]   came a point where people started talking to each other and saying you know what like this doesn't
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.660]   have to end like we can actually stick around so it wasn't just like people started sticking around
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.220]   like looking at each other like they actually started talking about it right because the bay
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.980]   area was not like the place yeah it was like orchards now uh-huh silicon valley was like an actual
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:58.500]   valley there was no silicon valley sf was not yet like a tech hub all the jobs were like in socal and
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:04.580]   other places um so it was kind of a radical thought that like sacrifice like you know we can choose
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.580]   to stay and to invest in this church and each other and build something really special here and so you
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.700]   know you hear about like peter choi the guy who coined this term acts two church in every college
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.220]   town who coined that slogan um you know he took like a job at like a computer parts minimum wage job
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.660]   yeah berkeley grad working a minimum wage job just so he could stick around you know other stories like that
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.860]   um and people started to kind of one by one make that decision to stick around so so lest you think
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.100]   that that was something orchestrated by my parents it actually wasn't like those sort of conversations
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.580]   started to happen actually like right around when my parents started coming to our church
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.020]   um in the late 80s and they weren't yet like the pastor figure so again it wasn't like you it's
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.860]   tempting to think of it as some like grandmaster scheme it really wasn't actually it was kind of
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.900]   kind of just happened it was a grassroots sort of thing and then over time that picked up momentum
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:01.460]   and i mean even i think when we were in college like we were kind of at the beginning edge of like
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:08.020]   this thing this phenomenon where like majority of the class was like sticking around now because even
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.860]   in even like in the 10 15 20 years prior like people would stick around but it was like you know okay
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.620]   it was like a handful so maybe like four or five out of a class of like 20 or 30.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.180]   um so it definitely evolved yeah over time kind of what i'm hearing you say is it's it's like
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.900]   people are close living out christian life together in college context experiencing acts
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.820]   too maybe they didn't even know it but that you know but to some degree that was like there's
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.540]   something special here and there's one inflection point which is where people are going like hey we
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.620]   you don't have this doesn't have to stop so then they're staying and so there's like that kind
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.300]   of family feel but then in when we were an undergrad there was kind of another inflection yeah it was
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.500]   kind of a jump where it was like suddenly this like the whole idea of every college town this this
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:54.180]   church planting on college campuses kind of took off right and i remember um our sophomore year
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:00.340]   2010 having 2009 the uh thanksgiving retreat where like our austin peers came up right it was kind of
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.500]   the first group of students for the austin church plant and they sang thank you for giving to the
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.860]   lord and there was like not a dry eye in in the auditorium and like for me it was just as a
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.100]   sophomore i'm just like cool you know like it was great but i didn't know how much that meant to like
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.460]   the older leaders and stuff who had sent off that first team yeah yeah so back to backtrack a little
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.980]   bit right 2006 we became independent we became grace point and that wasn't like uh hey let's all go
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.460]   independent guys it was it was it was a tough time right i don't want to go into all the lurid details
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.140]   right but like it was it meant some lost relationships like personally all my best friends who i grew up with
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.140]   were on the other side of that split yeah and kind of overnight i lost my reference group in a way
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.460]   i mean they were my only reference group but i was a junior in high school and they were like definitely
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:55.780]   my best friends um and kind of in a similar way um we as a church were feeling just wow kind of i don't
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.100]   know i don't know if rudderless is the right term but definitely like well we're kind of alone in the world
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:10.020]   now and to plan a plan our first church as grace point in 2008 it felt soon like well we just came
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.620]   independent we're really going to do this it felt vulnerable like what if something like this happens
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.260]   again in the future and you know another split happens like what about that and there was just
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.060]   a lot of fears around it and so it was almost like yeah planning i've said this before planning
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.700]   a church in 2008 kind of felt like it would kill us like we thought we were going to die i mean looking
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.980]   back is a little melodramatic i mean because it's not like they were going to like i don't know
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.260]   antarctica they're going to austin in the states yeah you know i mean texas is different but it's not
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.940]   that different but anyway um so that church plant happened and then yeah what you were describing that
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.980]   first year when they came back and those guys were actually our peers yeah um so it's neat shout out to uh
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:54.420]   yeah francis david g lu all those dudes um so i mean because of that church plant those guys are
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:00.500]   here and we have the relationships we do and so because of that that sort of emboldened our church
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:06.260]   i think um and then 2010 and in some ways i think 2010 affected you a lot more than it affected me yeah
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.380]   well like yeah i mean just to comment on what you were just talking about like i love that that it was
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:18.260]   really out of a place of weakness you know um and and what i i think what i've learned a lot because
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.020]   you know i came from a charismatic vineyard church and even reading like the vineyard story kind of
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.660]   gave me a understanding that god works through weakness right anyway that's just one of the things
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:32.820]   i love about this story um but yeah in 2010 then we planted like you know three it was like three in
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.020]   a year three yeah we got both all of a sudden sd riverside and minnesota yeah and i remember that winter
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.100]   retreat where they were announcing who was going to be on those teams and i remember had my three
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.300]   mentors and it was like sd is you know uh richard lung and i was like oh it's one of my mentors and
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:53.700]   riverside abe yang oh that's another one of my mentors minnesota john kreeley you know all three of
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.420]   my leaders are gone me and my friends leave each other we're like who's leading us next year like what
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   what's happening you know and it was just like will who left was like ah so that was i mean we never did
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.740]   it that way again because that was a little traumatic yeah yeah it was but um by the same
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.540]   time that that was actually for me when i started picking up on this vision because um i'm from socal
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.700]   and so i would go back for breaks and i would go on these domestic mission trips where i'd go to
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.420]   riverside and like bob was there our friend and good our good friend bob um and he would he would pick
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   me up for service and stuff but then we would go on these like week-long where you know welcome week as
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.180]   as people are coming back to school we're just doing outreach and stuff and i just remember those mission
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.460]   just being so magical because you go out the day you you go you're like you're a missionary for a
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.740]   week you go out for the day all day you're doing outreach and meeting people you're talking about
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.820]   god you're just trying to play ball and just get to know them and stuff you're throwing on events and
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.140]   all that kind of thing you come back you just tell each other how god was working that day you celebrate
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:55.140]   that you eat good food unhealthy food you know college food and did it again and again and again each day
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.180]   went to other campuses like la and irvine like prayed over there prayed god would bring a church there
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.420]   and we're just thinking like i can do this for the rest of my life i want to do this for the rest of
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:11.140]   my life with these people and with this mission you know and um it was it was exciting and it took off
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.220]   and so we have like all these videos and we'll link some in the description of just like the growth of
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:21.940]   our church and and and all that and it's kind of been kind of crazy you know like to to because we're on
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:28.580]   70 plus campuses now nationwide network and yes all the older ones they're like we didn't plan for this
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:35.060]   no way yeah and uh and then even just like when i tell people about the latest round of church planning
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:41.380]   2021 you know thousand people signed up after covid to go on a church plant these are our bivocational
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:47.540]   you know members and then we sent out 300 plus to midwest and northeast 400 400 yeah i think so
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.580]   and philly you know the 30 of us in philly is is just part of that wave so then people ask us like
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:15:00.420]   how how right and so i guess my question is like okay yeah if you were to say what are the key
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.020]   ingredients to that like what enables us to do that yeah yeah yeah and we might be repeating some of the
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.980]   stuff we've already said but yeah what would be the key ingredients to like what we look like today you
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:16.900]   know yeah yeah so i think man there's a lot that goes into that but i think one thing that i often
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:23.380]   say and that you'll you'll hear different leaders around here saying is that like our our secret sauce
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:29.940]   like like okay when you look at any one of us we are not very remarkable people we're not especially
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.140]   smart i think we're probably like uh we're better at cs than most churches probably like that's something
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:42.020]   but it's not like we're super charismatic i like our our our preachers are not like amazing you know
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:47.940]   um we often say we have like a lot of leaders with no leadership um like like we're just very ordinary
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.580]   folk yeah yeah and like i don't think you know we're composed of these heroes of faith and yet you know
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.540]   when we you know go to conferences and other pastors like hear these numbers of how many churches
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.340]   we planted and stuff they're they're kind of dumbfounded yeah um and and when we thought about it like
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.940]   when i think about it i think the secret sauce of it it goes back to that very beginning of that
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.380]   experience of doing life together and deciding to continue that pattern of life that you had as a
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.300]   college student into your post-grad years and not stopping that yeah you know so that there's this
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:25.220]   closeness um that really and and closeness community begets courage you know when you have people who are
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.700]   doing it with you when you have people that you know you can trust that you are covenanted with
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.020]   then it makes you bold and makes you able to do things that you would never be able to do on your
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.100]   own and you know we always use this example um when talking about this but you know like if you're
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.860]   if you're on a you know lonely mountain road and your car breaks down you're by yourself yeah right
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.820]   that's that's a horror movie it's over like a disaster something terrible right but when that
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.220]   happens with a car full of friends yeah right then you just have to outrun the other guy no i'm just
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:57.540]   kidding yes is that how you think about okay i mean never to get stuck with you no but but if it
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.780]   happens with a car full of friends it's an adventure yeah and it's a fun story to tell later and all
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.420]   those things right and i think that's kind of our experience of of church planting it's like you know
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.580]   if we do it together there's not much we can't do yeah so what is it that your dad's like what looks
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:17.140]   like high commitment is just covenant is actually i wish i had a better memory yeah yeah well i think what
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.580]   looks like high commitment is actually just community yeah yeah and then the other phrase
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.340]   we always say is if you want to go fast go by yourself but if you want to go far go together
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:29.860]   and so you know coming at that for that like like the whole closeness aspect i didn't really appreciate
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.060]   that you know i don't think i like i i would have wanted to go fast because i was a church kid i wanted
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:41.140]   to serve you know and and i feel like god personally my story was like slow down you know learn to build
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.180]   relationships because that's going to be the strength for like a lifelong you know serving and following
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.100]   god yeah and that's like so true so i think um people might not know this but actually back in
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.900]   the day our church was not very evangelistic um we were like we were you know there's the seeker
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.500]   friendly movement we like to say that we were seeker hostile back then you know and we talked about
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:04.260]   that we're gonna talk about that yeah with pastor will and um kind of the some of the like truly cringe
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.100]   things that we did as a church back then um but in some ways i think because we had that period where
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.820]   we just got close and we were like not effective at evangelism you know i think we tried here and there but
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.580]   you know a lot of that we learned from saddleback and other groups later on but there was a whole
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.660]   period where we did like nothing but just fellowship and like get really close i think and i think in
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.420]   some ways like to this day we're kind of powered by that period when i look back like the relationships
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:34.260]   among like the deacons and the older ones were forged kind of during that time and yeah and and i think
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.500]   one thing that we've been feeling in recent years is now we're starting to starting to run out a little
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.660]   bit and so you know in some ways we have to slow down go back to our roots make sure that we don't
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.220]   neglect our relationships with one another as we try to go fast yeah you don't want to outpace
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.100]   kind of that ministry like you don't want that to outpace what's happening internally exactly yeah
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:57.460]   yeah both in our relationships and our relationship god and all that so yeah yeah one key ingredient i
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:03.860]   also thought was um just everybody a minister we say that a lot like you know uh church planning is hard
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.900]   it's hard on a lot of fronts and it's hard i mean even just from the financial aspect right but
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.140]   so many people in our church are bi-vocational like co-vocational they have full-time jobs and
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.620]   stuff i mean you know i worked uh three years in affordable housing um doing that while doing
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:22.820]   college ministry i mean you did how many years of you did your law school i did a video i did yeah
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:29.220]   random things yeah i mean yeah and then and then my wife like seven years in just tech company you know
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:36.020]   while doing ministry um there's something about that like where like and people worked really hard they
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.700]   knew how to sacrifice you know um for uh the work of the gospel and then in terms of like church
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:47.060]   planting and being able to fund that like and and do that i think i think bible accelerated sort of the
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.740]   church some of the church planting i think so that would be another ingredient yeah yeah and then just
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.420]   kind of going off of that like the whole everyone administered thing i mean i think that's also what
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.860]   enables us to do what we do because you know i don't have to be like the most amazing leader in the world
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.180]   and i look at a lot of other church planters that i meet now and like hats off to them a lot of them
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:12.500]   it's kind of a one-man show yeah you know and by the force of their like will and personality and
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.460]   talent they're able to hold a church together i don't think i could do that on my own but i have
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.100]   like a lot of very committed team members yeah you know and so i know that we can do this together and
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.380]   they're there to kind of fill in my my failures and my foibles and that that really helps i think yeah
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.820]   so you touched on this a little earlier just kind of like yeah like where we're at now as a church
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:39.700]   and going into the future right um so we talked about what makes us tick and um you know uh the
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.100]   things that that form kind of who we are now that led up to what we look like now and trying to make
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.660]   sense of that where do you see us going in the future maybe we could just end this podcast a little
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:55.540]   like maybe next five ten years you know yeah um what what is gonna continue you know or what was that
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.700]   look like yeah yeah i mean so i i've been thinking about that a lot and we've been talking about that
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.180]   i think because your parents are they're i mean they're about you know yeah they said today they're
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.860]   retiring in five years i don't know if that's true or they were just in that kind of mood today but
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:14.580]   that's what they said um but maybe i shouldn't have said that oh shoot but um but the the whole
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.100]   thing about like yeah where is our church going to be i mean i i think we're never gonna we're never
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.420]   gonna abandon acts to church in every college town like i think that's that's where we started we're
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.820]   gonna be faithful to that you know unless god gives us a clear sign to get out of that um but
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.620]   i think what's been really interesting in the past really the past year but maybe past five years or so
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.580]   is kind of this what we've been calling like the pivot to youth ministry um i feel like god has kind
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:43.380]   of expanded our vision um and i i think we need a whole new episode to like go into this yeah this
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.500]   requires a whole new yeah but i just in brief i think there's been a lot of signs that have been
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.380]   pointing us towards youth ministry whether it be just the all these big churches we we did kind
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.860]   of our own research and found that the top 25 biggest churches in america more than half of them
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.660]   don't have a high school group you know um we've been finding out that there's just all these churches
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.780]   especially after covid where the youth groups have just been decimated and yeah um a lot of just youth
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.820]   leaders quitting because it's so hard these days you can't find youth pastors yeah you can't find youth
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.780]   pastors anymore and so we've been just feeling like man we need to expand and not just think
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.620]   of ourselves as just a college focused church so for me i see it as as we're keeping the college
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.500]   ministry thing we're not in some ways we're even like you know incurred like for for questions to
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.220]   become youth mentors yeah and disciple them that way yeah because i feel like college college students
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.420]   are like the best people yeah it was college students who who led my middle school youth group and
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.380]   led me to christ and and in many ways who i am today is because of that because of them was such a
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:47.940]   formative period you know so i i love the pivot i think it makes sense and i mean i don't personally
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.340]   i'm like i'm not like a youth ministry you know like i'm not i'm not that charismatic youth pastor
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.580]   ministry like whatever thing but like yeah like you said like because we're doing it together yeah right
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:02.340]   yeah and um so i definitely think that i think that's in the future um i don't know i think we're
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:08.500]   gonna keep grace point the name like i don't know man i kind of think when we've planted philly we're
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.540]   like we want to do yeah story church i kind of think we got to let go of the name and but i mean
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.740]   that's my two cents that we should all just it's it's it's tough though it is tough i i don't want to
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.900]   prognosticate too much on that but yeah well i mean what do you what do you see five ten years what do
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:31.540]   you think oh man um i think we're i i don't know i would like to dream big um we're already international
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   you know and we got our church in shiju taiwan but i think we will go more places international
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.780]   that's one thing but that's something i've been thinking about oh yeah a lot about kind of that
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.180]   being the next phase but anyway sorry go on yeah i'm just curious if you would like to go somewhere
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.660]   what would you want to go i don't know maybe we have to talk to our wife you know you know this is gonna
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:58.820]   seem super random but belgium belgium oh we met this one yeah i won't name him here um but we met
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:03.860]   this one law student from belgium this past year and he kept telling us non-christian guy but he kept
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.300]   telling us you know what there's there's nothing like what you guys are doing here in my home country
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.940]   yeah and christianity is hated here but if there was a group like yours like i would come and he actually
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.740]   became christian this past summer praise the lord that's a whole story in and of itself but
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.620]   i don't know that would be neat yeah he's like if you ever come to europe come to my country you know
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.660]   and i ever since then that that's kind of haunted me i've been feeling like oh man but i love that
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.300]   because it's like it's not because we have a great vision for belgium it's that connection we have yeah
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:39.140]   through that guy now yeah right um and i love the way that works so we'll see how god works and moves um
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:46.820]   but i'm excited you know and and just god willing we'll be able to just continue amen amen all right so
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.660]   that's a little bit of overview hopefully you got a better idea of of our group and and what we're
