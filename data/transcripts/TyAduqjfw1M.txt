[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Well, what difference would it make in your life if you saw God's providence as true and
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.920]   biblical and beautiful?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760]   Something so incredible you could build your entire life on it.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760]   Would it change your life?
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600]   Pastor John is betting it will, and so we want to focus on these implications for a
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.240]   season here on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.440]   As you know, Pastor John's big book, Providence, releases this month.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.320]   It's a huge 700-page long book, has over 3,000 Bible citations.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.800]   But over the course of the next several weeks, we want to look at the so what's of the doctrine
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.400]   and show you how some of the most important key life application points are relevant for
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.720]   your busy life.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.000]   So for the next several weeks, we're going to put our sermon clip Wednesdays on hold
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.800]   in order to focus on the immediate implications of providence.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.360]   Today is week number one, an introduction to a series with 10 episodes to follow.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.200]   Here now is Pastor John to introduce our new Wednesday series.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   Tony, let me give at least three reasons why this feels so right to me, so urgent, to build
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.800]   11 sessions on providence into the flow of Ask Pastor John.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:33.080]   First, what is in this book on providence and in these episodes is the foundation of
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.840]   every single answer I ever give on this program.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.480]   If people understand what I mean by the providence of God and its benefits, it will inform and
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.280]   deepen every single answer that they ever hear on this podcast.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   That's reason number one.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:06.880]   Number two, since God's providence is all embracing and all pervading, it relates powerfully,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.200]   meaningfully, immediately to every situation in every person's life.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.680]   Everything is outside the providence of God.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.660]   His design in his providence at every moment of our lives is relevant for how we live and
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.000]   how we respond to everything that comes our way.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I really want our listeners, and this would be another reason why it feels so fitting
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.980]   to put the series here, I really want our listeners to have this book on their shelf
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.760]   as a reference book for a hundred issues in their lives and ministry.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.600]   I know, and you know, Tony, that most people do not read 700-page books, but they do put
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:05.360]   them on their shelves if they have 3,000 Bible references in the index that enables them
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.000]   to find the issue they're dealing with and see how the providence of God relates to it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.340]   And I am jealous that our listeners, our listeners especially, have access to those thousand
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.420]   passages of Scripture that bring the providence of God to bear on their lives.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.340]   So Tony, I love this family of listeners to Ask Pastor John, and I wouldn't press the
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.300]   providence of God into our ordinary flow of question and answer if I didn't think it would
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.660]   be really worth everybody's time.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.860]   Somebody asked me how long it took me to write the book on providence, and I said, "Oh, about
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.340]   50 years."
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.900]   And of course what I meant was that this book is the consummation or the capstone of all
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.660]   the most important things I have ever discovered about God and his ways and his goals in the
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.660]   Bible.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.460]   This book is the most comprehensive statement of the things in Scripture that I regard to
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.880]   be most important for worshiping and living and dying.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.100]   What we want to do in this series of Ask Pastor John is draw out 10 effects, 10 real-life
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.900]   implications of seeing and savoring this vision of God's providence as real and beautiful.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.660]   In other words, what difference would it make in your life if you saw this vision of God's
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.980]   providence as true and biblical and beautiful, if you embrace it and build your life on it?
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:56.660]   So that's where we are going, 10 powerful effects of seeing and savoring the all-pervasive
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.540]   providence of God.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:08.180]   But in this first session, I think it is absolutely crucial that I make clear what I mean by the
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.940]   word providence, the reality providence.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.260]   What's the definition?
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.260]   What's the extent?
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.260]   What's the nature?
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.100]   What's the goal?
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.500]   That is the whole book, and we're going to do it in just a few minutes.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.180]   And then following are 10 sessions that bring out 10 real-life implications of embracing
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.900]   this reality.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.540]   So first, by providence, I mean God's purposeful sovereignty, purposeful sovereignty.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.180]   In other words, the difference between God's sovereignty and God's providence is that His
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.060]   sovereignty is His right and power to do all that He pleases.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.780]   And His providence is the exercise of that right and power purposefully.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.980]   Providence is God's use of His power and His authority to bring about an ultimate purpose
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.940]   for the universe, which cannot fail.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.620]   What then is the extent of His providence?
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.140]   How far does it reach?
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.380]   How detailed is it?
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.780]   What does it include?
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:22.120]   And my answer from Scripture is that God's providence is all-pervading and all-embracing.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:30.180]   There is nothing, nothing in the universe that lies outside God's meticulous and infinitely
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.220]   far-reaching governance.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:42.920]   In Ephesians 1.11, Paul refers to the predestining God as "him who works all things according
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.560]   to the counsel of his will."
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   The climax of the book of Job in chapter 42, verse 2 says, "I know you can do all things,
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.960]   and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:05.840]   Isaiah chapter 46, verse 10, God says that part of what it means to be God is "my counsel
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.600]   shall stand, I will accomplish all my purpose."
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.240]   So He governs all things, all His purpose is achieved, no purpose can be thwarted.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.160]   And that is true, Jesus said, of the smallest details, like a bird falling from the sky,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   Matthew 10.29.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.320]   Isaiah said it was true of the biggest things, like placing the stars in place and calling
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.960]   them all by name, Isaiah 40, verse 26.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:42.320]   And Luke said in Acts 4.27 and 28 that this providence even governs the sinful actions
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.840]   of Christ-killing Herod, Pilate, Jews, Gentiles, all of us, basically.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.280]   The extent of God's providence is all-pervading and all-embracing.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.040]   What about its nature?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.640]   And what I mean by that is that does He govern by coercion?
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.320]   Is that the nature of it?
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.400]   Does He take away the meaningfulness of human volition as He governs all things and all
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   people?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:19.800]   No, the nature of God's providence is formed by His wisdom and justice and mercy.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.840]   Daniel 4, all His works are right and His ways are just.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:34.600]   Psalm 104, how manifold are Your works in wisdom, You have made them all.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.520]   The judge of the universe always does what is right.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:49.320]   Genesis 18.25, no angel, no demon, no human is ever treated worse than they deserve.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.480]   None.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.400]   The nature of God's providence is infinitely wise and always just.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   And finally, what is the goal of providence?
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.080]   If providence is purposeful sovereignty, what's the ultimate purpose of it all?
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.100]   Creation, history, redemption, where's it all going?
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.560]   When I first started to write this book, I thought it would be a book about the nature
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.300]   and extent of providence, period.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.960]   That's all, just those two.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:33.280]   And as I began to write, I realized I can't speak meaningfully about God's governing all
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:41.960]   things and His doing it in a just and wise way without talking about how God makes His
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.120]   wise choices.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:52.880]   Tens and billions of them, unless these choices are made to take the universe somewhere rather
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.120]   than being whimsical or being made willy-nilly.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.320]   So the goal of providence now takes up one-third of the book.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:09.480]   So here's my one-sentence summary of those 250 pages.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:18.720]   The ultimate goal of God's providence is to glorify His grace in the spiritual and moral
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:28.440]   and bodily beauty of Christ's undeserving, blood-bought bride, the Church, the redeemed
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   from all ages, as she enjoys, reflects, and thus magnifies His greatness.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:48.600]   And beauty and worth above everything in the new heavens and in the new earth.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:58.960]   Now perhaps we are ready to turn with some understanding to those 10 real-life effects
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:07.440]   of embracing this all-pervading, all-embracing, infinitely wise, infinitely just providence
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:17.280]   of God as He pursues the glory of His grace in the joy of our souls in Him.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.680]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   Amen.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   I'm looking forward to it as well.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.800]   Join us next Wednesday for part two when we look at the affectional side of providence,
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:32.160]   namely how seeing and savoring this providence awakens and sustains wonder and awe and holy
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.400]   reverence within us.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   Looking forward to that part.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.520]   But first up, next time on Friday, Pastor John joins me back in the studio.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.320]   And next up is a really important question we get all the time.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.840]   Basically, how often should we be questioning our salvation?
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:53.280]   How much is too much when questioning the legitimacy of our own conversion?
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.720]   We'll see you on Friday for that.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.360]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   Piper.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   We'll see you Friday.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.860]   [End of program]
