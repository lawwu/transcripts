[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - New week, new day, new mercies.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.240]   So welcome back to the podcast on this Monday.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.000]   We are gonna start the week talking about nicotine,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.080]   pipe smoking specifically.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.880]   But I think this topic in this question
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.240]   is likely gonna open up a much broader conversation
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.080]   about other stimulants like caffeine, sugar,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.120]   amphetamines and cannabis and THC for some.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.280]   Those substances that provoke the central nervous system.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240]   The question is from a listener named Robert
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.040]   in Coldwater, Mississippi.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.080]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.360]   18 months ago in APJ 1702,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   you published an episode titled
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.720]   "On Cigarettes, Vaping and Nicotine."
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   It proved helpful to me,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.780]   but I have a follow-up question for you.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.960]   Many years ago when I chewed smokeless tobacco,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.600]   I discovered that my concentration for reading was improved.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.240]   Apparently the nicotine did something to my mind
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.280]   and body to increase my focus.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.680]   Today I am considering taking up pipe smoking,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.480]   something like C.S. Lewis did.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.240]   I would continue this only if it improved my concentration.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.000]   Pastor John, would you address the use of nicotine
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.260]   for the purpose of improved concentration?
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.880]   - Well, I come at a question like this
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.520]   basically in the same category as everybody else.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.040]   I am simply not an expert
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.160]   in all the possible effects
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.880]   medically, socially, psychologically
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.560]   that nicotine or other drugs
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.720]   might have on the human person.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.920]   I have to do my simple research online
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560]   just like everybody else does.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.800]   That's how I get ready for this podcast.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.660]   I do what everybody else can do.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.200]   I look for definitions and I go to Wikipedia,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.600]   I go to medical websites and I try to get up to speed.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.160]   So don't put me in any kind of pedestal here.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.360]   Like he's got some authority
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240]   on how to answer a question like this.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.800]   I got my Bible, you got your Bible,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.360]   I've got Wikipedia, you got Wikipedia, here we go.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.680]   But here's what I can do.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.200]   What I can do is highlight some possible outcomes
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.080]   just like anybody else can of the use of various drugs.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   And I can point to some biblical guidelines
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.660]   and then pray that God's people, myself included,
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.840]   would have great wisdom and great self-control
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.800]   and great passion for holiness and purity
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000]   and great love for others
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.960]   as we make our way through these days
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.520]   when more and more natural
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.920]   and artificial stimulants are available.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.760]   As I think about this question
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.400]   that he's asking about nicotine in particular,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.280]   I'm gonna broaden it out because here in Minnesota,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.960]   a far more urgent question concerns cannabis,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.120]   the constituent of marijuana,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.360]   and the relatively recent upsurge
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   of cannabis-infused drinks on sale
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.800]   for anybody wherever they have them,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.120]   and they're available.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.040]   And they're increasingly available
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.080]   with all different percentages of cannabis.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.360]   The marijuana-like substance that goes into these drinks
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.360]   is called THC, which is short for an unpronounceable,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.320]   long scientific word, which you can see in Wikipedia.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.800]   That's the psychoactive constituent of cannabis,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.360]   and that's what's getting infused
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   into all kinds of drinks and foods.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.760]   If you read about the effects of THC,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.040]   what you read is that there is a wide range
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   of possible effects from heightened sensory perception.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   I think that's what Robert's talking about.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   Relaxation, sleepiness, dizziness, dry mouth, euphoria,
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.440]   depersonalization, derealization, hallucination, paranoia,
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.320]   decreased or increased anxiety.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.400]   Now, the difference between smoking marijuana
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.880]   and drinking THC-infused drinks
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.160]   is that when the drug is inhaled into the lungs,
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.720]   it passes quickly into the bloodstream,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.120]   peaking in about 10 minutes
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   and wearing off in a couple hours,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.520]   while cannabis-infused foods and drinks
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.680]   may take hours to digest,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.600]   and their effects may peak two or three hours
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.840]   and persist for up to six hours.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.280]   So, Wikipedia, you think I know things?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   I don't know anything.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.320]   (both laughing)
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.880]   This is just all learned for this podcast.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.240]   Of course, cannabis and nicotine
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   are just two of many psychoactive stimulants,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.880]   including sugar, caffeine, alcohol, opioids,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   needle, not to mention the hard drugs that are illegal.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.760]   Now, Robert says he used to use chewing tobacco
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.160]   as a way of getting better concentration,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.680]   and he's thinking about taking up pipe smoking
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.080]   if it works for the same reason.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.520]   And what's surprising in his question to me
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.520]   is that it didn't raise any of the downsides of tobacco.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.400]   I mean, if you go to the Health and Human Services website
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.840]   online and just ask about that,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.400]   here's what you read.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.960]   Chewing tobacco can cause many types of cancer,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.320]   including cancer of mouth, tongue,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.520]   gums, stomach, esophagus, bladder.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.160]   Heavy users might also notice
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.680]   that their teeth can start to get worn down
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.000]   and sustained by chewing tobacco,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.160]   which can also cause gums to recede.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   Regular chewing tobacco use
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.920]   is linked to higher heart attack risk too,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.120]   since it is known to raise blood pressure
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   and cholesterol levels, end quote.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.320]   And there are similar warnings for pipe smoking.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.720]   So for example, quote, "Cigar and pipe smokers
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.680]   "are more likely to develop heart disease, stroke,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.640]   "lung diseases than those who do not smoke."
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.600]   So you can do your own simple research,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.440]   just like I do on sugar.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.560]   I mean, how serious is that?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.400]   Or caffeine or alcohol or various preservatives
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.440]   or in drugs and foods,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.320]   all kinds of things that worry people these days.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   The New Testament does not solve these ethical problems
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.640]   of what we should eat, what we should drink,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.600]   how much or not at all.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.200]   It doesn't solve these problems
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   by giving us a list of foods and drinks that are lawful.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.880]   It couldn't.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.680]   You can't even foresee what was coming down the pike.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.240]   The New Testament writers
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.800]   weren't given that kind of prescience.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.720]   It addresses these things much more profoundly
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.360]   than giving us a list of foods that we should avoid
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.960]   or drinks that we should avoid.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   It deals with the nature of what goes into the body
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.200]   or comes out of the body,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.600]   the nature of who we are as Christians,
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.520]   the nature of our body and our soul,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.080]   the nature of our calling as Christians
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.760]   and what life in the body is for
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.880]   and how we personally relate to other people
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.440]   in regard to what we eat or drink.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   So here's my summary of biblical realities
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.320]   in the form of eight guidelines.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.120]   And I've never listed them like this before.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.960]   This was all fresh for me as I thought about
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.120]   getting ready for this particular question.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.040]   And I found breaking them out like this was helpful for me.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.400]   I hope it will be for others.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.240]   I'll just, I'll state it simply
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.760]   and give you the place that I get it from the Bible.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.240]   Number one, foods or drinks,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.840]   material things that go into the body
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.600]   are not in themselves spiritually contaminating.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.560]   It is the motives and the aims and the effects
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.520]   that food and drink become morally significant.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   That's how they become morally significant.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.400]   Jesus said to them, this is Mark 7, 18,
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.680]   "Are you so lacking in understanding?
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.280]   Do you not see that whatever goes into a person
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.640]   from outside cannot defile him
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.320]   since it does not enter into his heart,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.800]   but his stomach and is expelled?"
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.320]   Thus, he declared all foods clean.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.440]   And he said, "What comes out of a person
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.480]   is what defiles him."
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.200]   That's principle number one.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.000]   It isn't foods that defile,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.080]   it's motives and aims come out of the heart.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   Number two, therefore, food and drink
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   are God's good creation and meant to be enjoyed
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.120]   as an occasion of thanksgiving to God.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.520]   1 Timothy 3, 1 Timothy 4, 3-5.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.440]   "False teachers require abstinence from food
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.560]   that God created to be received with thanksgiving
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.760]   by those who believe and know the truth.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.840]   For everything created by God is good
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.560]   and nothing is to be rejected
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.720]   if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.440]   for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer."
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:11.200]   Number three, the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.000]   We should let that have a very profound effect on us.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.240]   Keep the temple holy
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.480]   because it's inhabited by the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   Keep the body properly set apart for God's habitation.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.880]   1 Corinthians 6-19.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.800]   Do you not know that your body is the temple
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.280]   of the Holy Spirit, which is in you,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.040]   whom you have from God?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.600]   Number four, your body is a member of Christ.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.560]   Our bodies are part of Christ's body.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.320]   So we not only are inhabited by the Holy Spirit,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.200]   we're part of Christ.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.040]   We bring him into every habit we form with our bodies.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.200]   1 Corinthians 6-15.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.760]   Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.920]   Number five, Christians don't use their freedom
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.280]   just because they have it.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.160]   They ask about what is helpful
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.320]   for their faith and the faith of others.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.960]   All things are lawful for me,
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.040]   but not all things are helpful.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.360]   1 Corinthians 6-12.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.440]   Number six, Christians don't just use their freedom
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.280]   because they have it.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.160]   They seek to avoid freely walking into a habit
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.920]   that enslaves.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.320]   That happens.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.680]   People really do use their freedom to get enslaved.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.640]   Don't do that.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.800]   1 Corinthians 6-12.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.720]   All things are lawful for me,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.440]   but I will not be enslaved by anything.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.200]   Number seven, your body does not belong to you.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.480]   God bought it with the blood of Christ.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.560]   God owns your body.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.680]   It's his.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.520]   His purpose is that you make your choices
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.560]   about your body in order to make God look valuable,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.000]   beautiful, satisfying.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.480]   1 Corinthians 6-19-20.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.160]   You are not your own.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.040]   You were bought with a price.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.440]   So glorify God in your body.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.960]   Number eight, Christians don't make food and drink
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.680]   and stimulant decisions in isolation.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.120]   They walk in love and take into account
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.320]   how their habits will help or hurt others.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.080]   Therefore, this is 1 Corinthians 8-13.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.200]   Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.800]   I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.760]   So this is the way God wants us to live,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.720]   not by lists, but by the Spirit.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.080]   Paul put it like this in Romans 7-6.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.320]   But now we are released from the law,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.480]   having died to that which held us captive
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   so that we might serve in the new way of the Spirit
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.360]   and not in the old way of the written code.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.600]   And the new way of the Spirit
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.240]   is to let these passages inspired by the Spirit
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.360]   shape the way we see God,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.120]   the way we see Christ,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.600]   the way we see the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.720]   the way we see our bodies,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.480]   the way we see food and drugs,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.520]   the way we see freedom,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.600]   the way we see love and the good of other people.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   The new way of the Spirit is a whole new conception
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.000]   of God and Christ and Spirit and life and body and love.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.760]   And that's how Christians live.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   So may the Lord take Robert and me
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.320]   and all of us deep into His Word and Spirit,
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.520]   and may He be your teacher
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.080]   so that you and I and we would all walk in freedom,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.240]   in joy, in holiness for the glory of God.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.000]   - Amen.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.240]   And that 1 Corinthians 6-12 text is so key here.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.520]   And all things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.120]   We will not be dominated by anything.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.760]   That text has appeared 13 times in the past on this podcast.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.680]   And for obvious reasons, so key.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.280]   Thank you for joining us today.

[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.960]   Well, speaking of stimulants like caffeine, sugar,
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.880]   nicotine, amphetamines, and cannabis and THC for some,
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.800]   it requires wisdom.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.640]   So where do we find understanding?
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.180]   Next time we're gonna look at the five steps
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.680]   for finding wisdom for life.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.520]   That's up next.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.040]   I'm your host Tony Reike,
