[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Well, to be a Christian is a wonderful thing.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.760]   It's the greatest thing, in fact.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.780]   To find forgiveness in the cross of our Savior,
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.560]   to be united to Christ by His Spirit,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   to have the Father as our own Father,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.780]   and to commune with Him as His child.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.440]   These are the greatest gifts a creature can receive,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.680]   and so we give thanks.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.080]   And yet we also look forward to our resurrection
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.860]   and to new bodies that will enjoy God forever
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.200]   without any sinful impediments,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.600]   to our giving God all the glory He is worthy
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.200]   to receive from us, and in that,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800]   experiencing the fullest possible joy
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.600]   we can experience in ourselves.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   Cannot wait.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440]   But for now, we wait.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.620]   Because for all the incredible gifts and blessings
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.200]   we now have in Christ, to be a Christian in this life
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.360]   doesn't mean we are free from our disordered loves.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.200]   We're not.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   We're not.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.360]   And every Christian feels it, feels an ongoing civil war
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.200]   on the inside in our twisted loves and longings.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.680]   We both love God, and we find in us the remains
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.920]   of a treasonous impulse against the God we love
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.080]   and our attraction to sin.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.120]   The Bible explains this civil war.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.640]   Arguably, Romans 7, verses 14 to 25 makes the point.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.960]   Less arguably, Galatians 5, 16 to 17
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.080]   makes the same point, too.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.000]   So then, what do we do as Christians,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   redeemed by Christ's blood, sealed by the Spirit,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800]   adopted by the Father?
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.960]   What do we do with the disordered loves
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   that we still find at work inside of us?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.080]   Pastor John explained at the end of a sermon
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.600]   on Romans chapter seven, preached in 2001,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.640]   here he is drawing out pastoral application.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060]   - In view of all that the Bible says to us
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.060]   about our condition, our fallen condition
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   with this body of death, and our sinful condition
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.080]   with the body acting in treason to join forces
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.360]   with the power of sin to tempt us,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   in view of the fact that there's a law of sin still active
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.320]   and there's a body of death,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   we should not be surprised or thrown off balance
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.480]   when we meet in ourselves and in our children
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.380]   and in our spouses and in our loved ones
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.880]   and in our colleagues and our roommates and our neighbors
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.420]   some really excessive and distorted bodily desires.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:50.520]   Let me give you some examples
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.720]   and then say how I think we should respond.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.320]   Remember, we are being redeemed in stages.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.160]   Guilt is taken away right now.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.400]   All your sins are forgiven right now.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.040]   The Holy Spirit is dwelling in your life by faith
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.180]   if you're a believer right now.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.120]   No condemnation is hanging over you at all right now.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   And yet we wait for the redemption of our bodies
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.360]   and those bodies are bodies of death
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.720]   and places where sin sets up a base of operations often
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   and tempts us with excessive and distorted bodily desires.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:44.600]   For example, we see excessive desires for leisure,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.840]   tempting us to laziness and sloth.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.760]   We see excessive desires for food,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   tempting us to gluttony and all of its damaging effects.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.300]   We see excessive desires for drink,
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.240]   tempting us to alcoholism.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.560]   We see excessive desires for sex,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.940]   tempting us to lustfulness and fornication and adultery.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940]   And on top of all of those excessive desires,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.860]   this law of sin operating in our members
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.460]   produces distorted desires.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.300]   That shouldn't surprise us either.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.460]   The whole world is bent out of shape under the fall.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.060]   That's much of the point of Romans 1 to 3.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.860]   It's much of the point of part of Romans 8.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.860]   For example, we see distorted desires for food.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.260]   My father-in-law treated people before he died
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.020]   who had this incredible hankering
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.120]   for gray river clay in Georgia.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.340]   They ate clay until it filled their bowels
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.980]   and they died.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.300]   He would warn them not to take laxatives
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.660]   because it would kill them.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.740]   Why would anybody wanna eat clay?
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.300]   Or the whole issue of binging bags of cookies and so on.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.900]   Those are distortions of a good thing
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.620]   called appetite, desire.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.540]   Or we know about distorted desires of sex.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.980]   The desire to have satisfaction with one of your own sex,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.980]   whether homosexuality or lesbianism or bisexuality
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.460]   is one of many kinds of fallen distortions.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.140]   Another example would be the distortions of desire
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.140]   for pleasure, a kind of high,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.140]   and people resort to marijuana or speed or cocaine or LSD.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.420]   Why?
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.620]   What are these distortions,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.860]   these artificial ways of getting some kind of satisfaction
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.900]   and happiness?
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.500]   The world is just shot through our bodies.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.780]   These bodies of death are shot through
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.740]   with excessive desires and distorted desires.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.260]   There's not a person in this room
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.820]   who doesn't have one of those.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.540]   Now, what do we do?
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.620]   I'm calling you, pleading with you week after week
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.340]   for a biblical realism in Jesus Christ.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.220]   In Christ, by faith, we are united to him.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.180]   Before any of this is fixed, you hear this now,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.180]   by faith, we become united to Jesus, faith alone.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   We are united to him and his purchase pardon
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.820]   becomes perfectly ours and his perfect righteousness
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.060]   close this excessively desiring,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.940]   distortedly desiring body.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.100]   First, this is the gospel.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.620]   Now, what's the issue there?
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.820]   The issue in your life, believer,
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.820]   is not do I have excessive desires
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.540]   or do I have distorted desires?
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.860]   I say it with joy in my heart
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.860]   for those of you who struggle with homosexuality
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.420]   or with eating disorders or with drugs
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.980]   or with laziness.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.260]   I say it with joy in my heart.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.900]   The issue is not whether you have those excessive
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.980]   and distorted desires.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.740]   The issue is, will you say,
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.220]   who will deliver me from this body of death?
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.780]   And look away from yourself and your resources
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.340]   and say, thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.340]   who gives the victory.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.340]   And will you not make peace
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.980]   with the law of sin and find yourself at home
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.380]   in the body of death,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.380]   but rather make war all your life
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:55.180]   until your body is finally redeemed at the resurrection?
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.500]   That's the issue.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.700]   So you walk up to me at the end of the service
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.500]   in five minutes and say with trembling,
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.620]   I'd like you to pray for me
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.380]   because I've never told anybody,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.660]   but I really struggle with homosexuality.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.220]   I'm not gonna be surprised.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.660]   Happens a lot.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.540]   You say to me, nobody knows about what I'm doing with food.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.460]   Nobody knows.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.740]   I'm not gonna be surprised.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.820]   Nothing surprises me anymore.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.060]   But I will call you to a massive hope
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.860]   that through faith there is justification
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.980]   and through faith there is forgiveness.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.220]   And then by that same Christ comes incrementally,
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.020]   sometimes in leaps and bounds
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.180]   and sometimes through long agonizing wrestling,
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.300]   a triumph that will be secured the last day
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.260]   because of the blood of Jesus.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.820]   - Powerful pastoral application
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.380]   taken from the end of John Piper's sermon
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.740]   preached on August 19th, 2001.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.020]   A sermon titled, "Who is this divided man?" part five.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   Part of a series on Romans chapter seven, verses 14 to 25,
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.740]   which raises again the ongoing debate
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.180]   over whether or not Romans seven
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.020]   is speaking of the struggles of a believer
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.820]   or the struggles of a pre-believer.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.420]   Pastor John says, of course, believer,
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.940]   but we've only briefly talked about that debate here
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.940]   in APJ's 802, 1183, and 1438 for what it's worth.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.180]   But we should cover that in the future more directly.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.540]   But this is a great clip from a listener with this note.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.780]   Dear Pastor John and the APJ team,
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.020]   hello, my name is Svetlana and I live in Greece
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.660]   where despite deeply rooted prevailing heresies
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.240]   in the religious culture here,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.980]   the work of Paul the Apostle is still bearing great fruit.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.500]   And praise the Lord, I've been immensely helped
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.980]   by your service to God, Pastor John,
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.380]   in your personal examples and in your sermons.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.060]   I have listened several times to your series on Romans seven,
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.820]   "Who is this divided man?"
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.820]   And what especially resonates with me
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.020]   was this honest admission at the end of part five.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.340]   To my sorrow, I struggle with food sins
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.320]   that I've not shared with anybody, not until now.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.200]   This clip has served me in incredible ways over the years,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.320]   and I would be humbled if you would share it
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.660]   about the civil war we fight within our flesh
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.500]   with love in Christ from Greece.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.620]   Amen, thank you, Svetlana, and we hope and pray
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.260]   that you will be open with the struggle
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.060]   with the people in your life now too,
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.020]   your Christian friends and pastors as well.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.980]   That was a great clip, a great find from Greece,
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.020]   sent to us via email.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.640]   If you have a clip, email me, I need your location,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.420]   first name, sermon title, and the timestamp
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.860]   of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.200]   Also tell me how it impacted you.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.740]   If it did, put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.460]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.600]   That is an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.080]   Well, speaking of our bodies,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.600]   can we make ourselves more holy
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.320]   if we treat our bodies more harshly?
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.400]   It's a great question about asceticism,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   and it's up next time.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.280]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.120]   See you then.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.280]   (upbeat music)
