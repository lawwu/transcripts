[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500]   Well, we have a follow-up question to episode 1269. In that episode, we talked about fantasy
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.140]   sports gambling, specifically related to DraftKings and FanDuel, prompting this question
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.340]   from a listener named Preston. "Hello, Pastor John. I listened to your episode where you
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.840]   discussed your thoughts on sports gambling being sinful. You said the system itself was
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.380]   evil and made the case that $50 contributed to a well-invested stock fund could yield
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:37.360]   a $230,000 future value over many years, and this would be a wiser use of the $50. My question
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.920]   is that if you invest the $50 into a stock fund instead, aren't you somewhat subscribing
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.180]   to unknown risk in the same way that you are with educated, not random, sports gambling?"
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.020]   This creates the question of how do we as Christians determine what the appropriate
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.520]   level of risk is with investing our dollar? Secondly, how can we trust that the investment
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.760]   industry is not also a system of evil in the same way sports gambling is? How can we trust
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.700]   that our dollar returned from an investment has not been earned in a crooked or sinful
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.300]   fashion in the same way a dollar from the sports gambling institution would be?
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.820]   Pastor John, what would you say to Preston?
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.180]   Let's take Preston's two questions one at a time. First, he asks, "If you invest the
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.540]   $50 a week into a stock fund instead, aren't you somewhat subscribing to unknown risk in
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.060]   the same way that you are with an educated, not random, sports gambling?" Now, if Preston
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.740]   had asked if there is some risk involved in investing money in a stock market or security
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.060]   of some kind, I would have simply said yes. But notice what he actually asked. He asked,
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.940]   "If you invest $50 in a stock fund instead, are you somewhat subscribing to unknown risk
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.700]   in the same way that you are with an educated, not random, sports gambling?" And the answer
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.740]   to that is no, no. There is always risk no matter what you do with your money. You bury
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060]   it and it'll rot maybe. You can hide it in the house and the house may burn down. You
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.620]   can put it in the bank, the banks may fail and the government that insures it may fail.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.020]   Put it in stocks with differing philosophies of principle protection and they all may go
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.540]   bankrupt. So yes, there is no escaping risk when it comes to money in this world or for
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.820]   that matter doing anything in this world. But when we ask whether gambling is risking
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.700]   in the same way as investing, the answer is no for several reasons. Number one, because
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.700]   investing means letting another person use your money for enterprises that you believe
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   contribute to the common good while gambling means supporting a system that is counterproductive
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.380]   to the common good and especially destructive for the poor. Number two, investing is not
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.900]   usually an all or nothing kind of risk. You may lose part of what you invest and pull
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:22.340]   out while gambling ordinarily is all is lost or something is gained. And three, investing
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.700]   lets you choose your degree of risk with greater clarity and probability than most gambling
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.740]   does. So there's at least three differences. But let me back up and say that when I was
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.380]   answering that question from which he was quoting about the sinful waste of $20 to $50
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.220]   a week on gambling with fantasy sports, my allusion to putting money away for 20 years
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.920]   and or 30 years and having $230,000 to buy a house with when you're 50, my allusion to
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.820]   that was simply to show that even the world thinks it's idiotic not to do that. My point
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.180]   was, and that's the best thing to do with your money. So let me make the real point
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.540]   about risk. While you might have to lose your life in the process, there is one kind of
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.260]   investing that is foolproof. Its dividends are absolutely certain and greater than any
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.500]   dividends in the universe. Here's the way Jesus put it. Do not lay up for yourselves
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.860]   treasures on earth. I don't care where, bank, dirt, mattress, stock market. Don't lay up
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.540]   for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and thieves break in and
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.940]   steal and stock markets go bearish. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.740]   neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.740]   is there where your heart be. Now how do you do that? That's foolproof investment. How
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.420]   do you do that? And here's the way Paul puts it in, or the way Jesus puts it in, I'll get
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:15.020]   to Paul in a minute, in Luke 12, 33. Sell your possessions and give to the needy and
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.300]   thus provide for yourselves money bags that do not grow old and treasure in the heavens
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. Sell your possessions
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.660]   and give. Be generous. Or here's the way Paul puts it now in 1 Timothy 6, 18. Tell the rich
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.980]   in this world not to set their hope on uncertain riches, but to do good and be rich in good
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:49.420]   works, to be generous, ready to share, and thus store up treasure for themselves as a
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.540]   good foundation for the future so that they can take hold of life, which is real life.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.860]   So I would say that the main emphasis in the financial life of a Christian should not be
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:11.420]   on how to minimize risk and maximize gain in the stock market, but rather on how to
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:20.620]   maximize eternal gain by maximizing generosity for the sake of causes that glorify God and
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.180]   rescue sinners from suffering, especially eternal suffering. But Preston asks another
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.660]   question. How can we trust that the investment industry is not also a system of evil in the
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:41.420]   same way that sports gambling is? And as far as I know, you can't. You can't know that.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.660]   But that's true of every dollar you spend in the marketplace. Any grocery store may
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.000]   be running a racket when you get your groceries. Any gas station you fill up at may be ripping
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.660]   off your customers with machines that are set false. Any clothing chain may exploit
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.460]   foreign workers where you get your shirt. Any company you invest in may support causes
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:13.220]   you deplore. I would say the rule is do the diligence you can before you invest and never
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.280]   invest in what you know is evil. But any thought that none of our spending and none of our
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:28.620]   investing will be misused by others is totally naive. But you're not responsible for all
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:37.620]   that somebody might do to misuse your money any more than a salt manufacturer is responsible
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.500]   for high blood pressure.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.700]   Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for the follow-up question, Preston, who was referring
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.300]   there to an episode we recorded in October, episode number 1269 titled, "Is it Sinful
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.340]   to Gamble on Fantasy Sports?" You can find that episode in our online home at DesiringGod.org/ask-pastor-john.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Wednesday. Thanks for listening to
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.820]   the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John Piper. We'll see you
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.020]   then.
