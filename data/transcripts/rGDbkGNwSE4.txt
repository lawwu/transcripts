[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   The core beliefs and the enshrined practices of Roman Catholicism deeply concerned the
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.160]   reformers 500 years ago, and those same concerns remain largely unalleviated for contemporary
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.240]   Protestants today, problems that we still see in the latest teachings of the Pope, and
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.640]   even in the most up-to-date version of the official Catechism of the Catholic Church.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720]   It all leads to a question over whether a devout Roman Catholic can be genuinely saved.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.320]   It comes from a listener named Jimmy. "Hello Pastor John, a close friend of mine passed
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   away recently. He was a great man, a good friend, a mentor to many young men like myself,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   and a devout Catholic. Will I see my friend in heaven, or does his theological views make
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.400]   this impossible? Can I rightly experience Paul's sorrowful yet always rejoicing mantra?
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.840]   Or was my friend merely a devout husband, a wonderful friend, and a good man?" In other
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.000]   words, do you believe devout Catholics can be genuine Christians?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.120]   Before I answer that specific question, let me lay out again the reasons we should be
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:14.480]   seriously concerned with Roman Catholic teaching, and that at numerous levels, its contradictory
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.660]   stance toward Scripture that produces, I think, a kind of religion which I fear has led many
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:30.160]   people astray, even into destruction. And I do not mean that Roman Catholicism has a
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.360]   corner on that kind of misleading teaching. There are lots of brands of so-called Christian
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.040]   tradition that have damaged people by the errors that they represent. So let me give
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.000]   you six examples of what concerns me about Roman Catholic teaching, and that I think
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   we should be very concerned about and steer clear of.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.800]   First, we should be concerned that the Roman Catholic Church elevates the authority of
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   the Pope and the church councils, when speaking in their official capacity as teachers of
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.320]   the church, to the same level as Holy Scripture. This has led many Roman Catholics away from
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.100]   a personal engagement with the Scriptures into a reliance on the church, even though
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.400]   the church is fallible, when they ought to be relying on the Scriptures, the very Word
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.200]   of God inspired and written.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.480]   Number two, I'm concerned, we should be concerned, that the Blessed Virgin Mary—and
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.420]   I have no problem calling her that—is elevated to a position in practice where she mediates
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.100]   between the people of God and the Son of God in a way that undermines the direct priestly
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.500]   ministry of Christ between his people and God. This elevation of Mary beyond anything
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.760]   in the Scriptures, based solely on church tradition, distances the people of God from
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.340]   the enjoyment of personal fellowship with Jesus and the kind of relationship and assurance
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.540]   they might otherwise enjoy with him.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:34.540]   Third, we should be concerned about the teaching of baptismal regeneration, the idea that an
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:45.380]   appropriate putting of water on the baby's head by the very work of the water—ex operae
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.820]   operato, by the very operating of the thing itself—by the very work of the water in
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:00.660]   the priestly act causes a change in the nature of the baby from lost in original sin to saved
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.620]   through regeneration. This notion has produced, I would say, untold, ill-founded confidence
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.380]   in the people of God who have little or no personal faith or relationship with Christ
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.140]   or love to Jesus, and yet because of their baptism believe they are heaven-bound.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:32.020]   Fourth, we should be concerned about the offering of so-called indulgences, which the very present
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.620]   pope himself—not in some distant 16th century past—the present pope himself has offered
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:50.540]   in our day. It involves certain kinds of pilgrimages or special buildings or special payments which
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.940]   one can perform or attend so that an indulgence is granted by the pope which provides forgiveness
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.580]   of sins. This is an appalling detraction from the absolute uniqueness of the death of Christ
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.620]   as the provision for sins and personal faith as the means by which that provision becomes
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.060]   ours. Fifth, we should be concerned about the confusion
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.940]   over the doctrine of justification by grace alone, on the basis of Christ alone, through
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.860]   faith alone, to the glory of God alone. The Roman Catholic insistence that justification
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.820]   consists in the infusion of righteousness, which as our own virtue qualifies us to be
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:53.460]   accepted by God, is not the same as the biblical doctrine of God becoming 100% for us in the
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.380]   moment when by faith we are united with Christ so that his blood and righteousness alone
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:08.700]   become the ground of that acceptance. Sixth, we should be concerned about the centrality
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:20.120]   of the mass in the Roman Catholic practice in which the bread and wine are actually transubstantiated.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:28.420]   They become the physical body and physical blood of Jesus so that the Lord's Supper
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.740]   takes on a power of salvation by the entering of the blood and the body of Jesus into us,
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.380]   which it never was intended to have in the Bible. It misleads millions of what's happening
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.300]   there. And finally, we should be concerned about
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.660]   the doctrine of purgatory in which a person after death may be given another chance of
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:01.540]   bearing some punishment so that finally they can make their way to heaven after doing appropriate
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:09.740]   penance there. The Bible holds out no such hope for those who die in unbelief. It is
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.700]   not found in the Scriptures. Now, having waved a flag of concern for those
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:26.300]   seven matters of Catholic belief, my answer to the question, nevertheless, is yes. I think
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   there are genuine Christians who are devout and inconsistent Roman Catholics—devout
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:42.820]   in the sense that they are earnest and serious, sincere, and inconsistent in the sense that
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:51.040]   their true heart embrace of Jesus is better than their mental ideas or doctrines.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.020]   If a person has a genuine encounter with the living Christ and recognizes the depth of
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:03.020]   human sinfulness and the hopelessness that we're in without grace and without Christ,
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.500]   and sees in Jesus the substitute that God provided to bear our punishment and provide
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.660]   all we need for acceptance with God, and that person throws himself on the mercy of Christ,
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.740]   despairing of all self-reliance, and cherishes Christ as his supreme treasure and hope for
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:31.620]   eternal life, that person will be saved, even if many doctrinal ideas are confused or erroneous.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.500]   In other words, it is possible for a person's heart and his essential grasp of Christ to
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:47.880]   be far better than the structures of his doctrinal framework, and we may all be very, very thankful
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   for this.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.660]   Amen. I am thankful for this, and all without diminishing those seven corrupting doctrines
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.300]   that we must continue to oppose today. Thank you, Pastor John. And, Jimmy, thank you for

[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:30.100]   Well, on Friday, we're going to talk about joy. We talk a lot about joy in God here at
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:36.020]   DG and on the podcast. It's at the core of what we do. So how closely connected is the
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:42.460]   full experience of our joy in God to the charisma, the gifts of the Spirit outlined by Paul in
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.200]   the epistles of the New Testament, like in 1 Corinthians 14, where he talks about the
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.060]   gifts of tongues and prophecy? What is the relationship of those gifts to our fullest
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.660]   expression and fullest enjoyment of our joy in God? That is the next question. Until then,
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.060]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Friday.
