[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.060]   All right.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.640]   So we have a question here from Sam.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.420]   Sam asks, do you have any advice for jack of all trades type people who want to
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.920]   become so good they can't ignore you?
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.300]   Well, my typical advice for that question is go read my friend,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.500]   Dave Epstein's book range.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.940]   Range is all about this.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.600]   It's about all the benefits of having multiple different skills.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.440]   It's about the serendipity that can unfold down the road where you don't
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   really know where you're going, but this skill plus that skill plus this skill
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.040]   combined to be something that was really uniquely valuable.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   And I think he does a really great job of talking about how this jack of
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.120]   all trades approach can work.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.420]   The thing I will add, and Dave and I talked about this when it came on my show,
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.340]   you can find an older episode where we, where I interviewed Dave and we talked
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.160]   about this is that even if you're doing a generalist or jack of all trades
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.020]   approach, you still have to get good at the individual things.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.180]   You still have to get to what we called in that interview, the non amateur level.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340]   That is the table stakes for a skill to potentially be useful in some sort
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.060]   of unique combination going forward.
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.500]   In my book, so good, they can't ignore you.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.620]   I talked about this as well.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620]   And I called it the auction market of career capital, where you build up
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.860]   career capital in several different areas and the combination is unique.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.260]   And then you can apply that unique combination to get
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.260]   cool things in your career.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.940]   Same idea.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.740]   You still have to build the capital.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.060]   You still have to get good.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.100]   So if you want to combine a master's degree in science with the ability
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.060]   to write like Dave Epstein did, he still went through and got the
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.820]   master's degree in science that was time consuming, and he still learned
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.780]   how to write by building his way up from entry level positions, the
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.980]   higher and higher level positions.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.860]   And then those two things came together and he could do science
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.100]   writing in a very interesting way.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.700]   So that's the only thing I would say.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.060]   You don't have to just have one skill that you're trying to master
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.100]   and be the best in the world.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.180]   That is one approach.
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.140]   It's not the only approach.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.860]   It's fine to build up a collection of skills that might come
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.820]   together in interesting ways.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.980]   Just keep in mind that you still have to build the skill.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.100]   There's no, no shortcut in getting good at something.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.580]   If you're not good at something, it basically doesn't count.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580]   It's not a tool in your toolbox.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.580]   So you don't have to be the world's best scientist to bring a science skill
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.900]   over to your writing career and have it help, but you also have to do more
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.700]   than just read one book on science.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.820]   You actually gonna have to do some hard work, maybe get a degree,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.740]   really learn what's going on.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.260]   So that's what I would say there.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.060]   Get non-bad, leave the amateur level.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.540]   Then you have something you can play with.
