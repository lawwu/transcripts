[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820]   Pastor John, you took a leave of absence in 2010.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.780]   It was eight months away from the ministry altogether, and you said it was a soul check
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.540]   over all the parts of your lifeâ€”marriage, worship, fathering, pastoring, public life,
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.540]   all of it.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.420]   Now, three years later, are there any lessons from the leave that you'd like to share with
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.380]   us here?
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.620]   The conference that we did, Acting the Miracle, really came out of that eight-month leave
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.340]   because it was built on the text Philippians 2.12, "Work out your salvation, for God is
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.580]   the one who is at work in you."
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.620]   So God saves us by His grace.
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.580]   We don't save ourselves by our works, but we're saved for good deeds.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.780]   We're created in Christ Jesus for good deeds, so we act out the fruit of our salvation,
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.660]   and our acting is a miracle because God is doing the willing and the acting.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.780]   We do it.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.700]   We do the acting.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.880]   We do the kindness.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.020]   We do the patience.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.940]   We do the purity, the love, but God is the one willing it and doing it, and so we're
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.860]   acting the miracle.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.300]   We're not puppets.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.260]   We have wills and muscles and minds, and puppets don't have any of those, but when we exert
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.460]   our wills, when we think with our minds and our muscles produce an act of obedience, it
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.940]   says God is doing the thinking and the willing and the acting in us, so we're acting the
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.940]   miracle.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.260]   Now, that was not new going into my leave of absence.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260]   Here's what was new along that line.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:54.260]   I had all my adult life ferociously fought the sin of lust, sexual temptation, and I
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.220]   say ferociously or fiercely because Jesus said, "Gouge out your eye.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220]   Cut off your hand."
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.980]   I mean, that's really serious, but what I had not done, and this was the discovery.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.140]   It was a huge and remains very important discovery.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.220]   I realized in that leave of absence that I did not attack with tearing out the eye and
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:31.620]   cutting off the hand fierceness in the same way my sins of irritability and frustration
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.780]   and anger and self-pity and sullenness and pouting.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.220]   I mean, I discovered how irrational I was.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.820]   I had formed the irrational sense, maybe I didn't articulate it, but the irrational sense
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.820]   that, well, those sins are just who I am.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.260]   I'm just bent that way, you know, towards being moody or being sullen or easy to getting
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.100]   frustrated or irritable or having a hair trigger.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.380]   I'm just wired that way so, well, as if I'm not wired to have lust.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.900]   I mean, you see the irrationality of it.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.220]   I was excusing not making war on those kinds of sins with anything like the intensity that
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.980]   I made war on my lustful sins.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.340]   In fact, you know, I used to develop all kinds of little acronyms like Anthem and so on to
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860]   fight.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.180]   I never created one of those for self-pity.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.860]   And I stood back during that leave and I said, "What's wrong with you?
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:53.580]   Why don't you see these relationship damaging sins of yours in the same seriousness?"
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.780]   And when you state it, you can almost see why because it sounds funny.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.980]   Like, what if I preached a sermon and I said to men, "Make war on pouting!"
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.500]   They would all say, "What?
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.620]   Make war on pouting, guys?"
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.740]   I mean, we come home and our wives don't welcome us the way we hope they would.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.180]   Or they don't want to go where we want to go tonight.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.220]   Or they don't do sex the way we hope they would do sex.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.300]   Or they don't fix the favorite food.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.860]   Or they criticize us when we got enough criticism at work today and we just kind of slink off
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.580]   to the den with our shoulders bent over and licking our wounds and saying, "Oh, poor
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.260]   me," like a little puppy.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.900]   That's just stupid, evil, wicked, unmanly, unspiritual behavior, and we need to make
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.580]   war on it just as seriously as we make war on lust.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.980]   So there it is, Tony.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.420]   That's the key lesson that I got.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.700]   God has resources for killing all sin.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.180]   And we make so much out of pornography and so much out of lust that we forget that the
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:17.100]   same seriousness, the same ferociousness and fierceness should go into attacking our personality,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.740]   sinful traits of irritability or frustration or anger or self-pity or sullenness or pouting.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.620]   And so here I am, what, three years later, and I think, I think God has given me some
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:40.500]   new measure of triumph in my marriage and in my relationships so that I do treat the
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:50.020]   first whiff of self-pity now somewhat like the way I treat the first whiff of sexual
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.020]   temptation.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.020]   Well said.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.980]   That conference mentioned earlier in the podcast, Act the Miracle, was our 2012 national conference,
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.140]   and the content of that conference was recently released in a book from Crossway under the
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.980]   title Acting the Miracle, God's Work and Ours in the Mystery of Sanctification, edited by
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.300]   John Piper and David Mathis.

[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
