[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   So today we have Chris Gerdes with us.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.920]   He's a professor at Stanford University
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.120]   where he studies how to build autonomous cars that perform at or
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.560]   beyond human levels both on the racetrack and on public roads.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.560]   So that includes a race car that goes 120 miles an hour
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.120]   autonomously on the racetrack. This is awesome.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   He spent most of 2016 as the chief innovation officer at the United States
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.480]   Department of Transportation and was part of the team that developed the
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.720]   federal automated vehicle policy. So he deeply cares about the role that
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.800]   artificial intelligence plays in our society both from the technology side
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.080]   and the policy perspective. So he is now I guess you could say a policy wonk,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.360]   a world-renowned engineer and I think always a car guy.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.080]   Yes. So he told me that he did a Q&A session with a group of third graders
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.080]   last week and he answered all of their heart hitting questions.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   So I encourage you guys to continue on that thread and ask Chris questions
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.840]   after his talk. So please give a warm welcome to Chris.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.600]   Great, Lex. Thanks for that great introduction and thanks for having me
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.400]   here to talk to everybody today. So this is sort of my first week back in
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.320]   a civilian role. I wrapped up at USDOT last week. So I'm no longer speaking
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.000]   and officially representing the department, although some of the slides are very
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.960]   similar to things that I use to speak and represent the department. So I think
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.480]   as of Friday, this was still fairly current, but I am sort of talking in my
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.160]   own capacity here. So I wanted to talk about both the technology side and the
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.600]   policy side of automated vehicles and in particular how some of the techniques
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.560]   that you're learning in this class around deep learning and neural networks
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.240]   really place some challenges on regulators and policy makers attempting
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.520]   to ensure vehicle safety. So just a bit about some of the cars in my background.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.360]   I am a car guy and I've gotten a chance to work on a lot of cool ones.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.440]   I actually have been working in automated vehicles since 1992 and the
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.080]   Lincoln Town Cars in the upper corner are part of an automated highway project
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   I worked on as a PhD student at Berkeley. I then went to Freightliner Heavy
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.640]   Trucks and Daimler Benz and worked with suspensions on heavy trucks before
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.680]   coming to Stanford and doing things like building P1 in the upper right corner
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.720]   there. That's an entirely student-built electric steer-by-wire, drive-by-wire
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.040]   vehicle. We've also instrumented vintage race cars, electrified a DeLorean, which
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.440]   I'll show a little bit later, and worked, as Lex mentioned, with Shelly, which is
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   our self-driving Audi TT, which is an automated race car. In addition to the
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.080]   Stanford work, I was a co-founder of Peloton Technology, which is a truck
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   platooning firm, looking at bringing platooning technology, so vehicle-to-
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.200]   vehicle communication, which allows for shorter following distance out on the
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.560]   highway. So these are some of the things I've had a chance to work with. To give
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.480]   you a little bit of a sense, this is Shelly going around the racetrack at
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.160]   Thunder Hill. She can actually go up to about 120 miles an hour or so on that
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.800]   track. It's really just limited by the length of the straight. It's kind of fun
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280]   to watch from the outside, a little disconcerting. Occasionally, as you see,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.320]   there's nobody in the car, although from inside it actually looks all pretty
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.960]   chill. So Shelly, we've been working with her for a while out on the track. She's
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.080]   able to get performance now, which exceeds the capability of anybody on the
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.480]   development team. Many of us are amateur racers. In fact, actually, most of
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.720]   my PhD students have their novice racing license. We make sure that they get that
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.940]   license before going out on the track and testing. So Shelly can beat anybody
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.080]   in the research group. She actually can beat the president of the track, David
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.800]   Vaughn, now. And we've had the opportunity to work recently with J.R. Hildebrandt,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.720]   the IndyCar driver who finished sixth this last year in the Indy 500. He's
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.300]   faster, but he's actually only about a second or so faster on a minute and 25
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.560]   second lap. So we're approaching his performance and he's actually helping us
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.480]   get there. Now, the interesting thing about this is that we've approached this
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.120]   problem really from one of physics. Force equals mass times acceleration. So the
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.960]   car is really out there calculating what it needs to do to break down into the
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.160]   next corner, how much grip that it thinks it has, and so forth as it's going
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.800]   around the track. It's not actually a learning approach at its core, although
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.920]   we've added on top a number of algorithms for learning because it turns
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.120]   out that the difference between the car's performance and the human
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   performance is really getting that last little bit of capability out of the
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.280]   tires. Humans drive instinctively in a way, the best humans at any rate, drive
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.020]   instinctively in a way which is constantly pushing to the limits of the
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.480]   car's capability. And so if you sort of prejudge what those limits are, you're
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.240]   not going to be quite as fast. And so that's one of the things we've actually
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.880]   been working with learning algorithms on is to try to figure out, well, how much
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.640]   friction do I have in this particular corner and how is that changing as the
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.920]   tires warm up and as a track warms up from the course of the morning till the
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.280]   afternoon. These are the things that we need to be fast on the racetrack, but
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.720]   there are also the things that you need to take into account to be safe in the
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.200]   real world. So what we're trying to do with this project is understand how the
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.720]   car can drive at the maximum capability of the limits of the friction between
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.700]   the tire and the road. Now race car drivers do that to be fast. As they say
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.280]   in racing, if you want to finish first, first you have to finish. So it's
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.400]   important that they actually be fast but also accident-free. So we're trying to
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.560]   learn the same things so that on the road when you may have unknown
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.280]   conditions ahead of you, the car can make the safest maneuver that's using all the
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.600]   friction between the tire and the road to avoid ultimately any accident that
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.680]   the car would be physically capable of avoiding. That's our goal with that. So
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.520]   we've had a lot of fun with Shelly. We've gotten to drive the car up Pikes Peak in
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.560]   the Bonneville Salt Flats. Actually Shelly appeared in an Audi commercial
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   with Zach Quinto and Leonard Nimoy and so at the end of the commercial they
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.880]   both look at each other and declare it fascinating. So if you're as big of a
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.080]   science fiction fan as I am, you realize that once your work has been declared
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.240]   fascinating by two Spocks, there's nowhere to go. So I had to take a stint
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.720]   and try something different in government. And so I spent the last year
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.960]   as the first Chief Innovation Officer at the US Department of Transportation,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.280]   which I think honestly was the coolest gig in the federal government because I
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.360]   really didn't have any assigned day-to-day responsibilities but I got
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.560]   to kind of dive in and help with all manner of really cool projects, including
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.840]   the development of the first federal automated vehicle policy. So it's a
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   really great opportunity to sort of see things from a different perspective. And
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.400]   so what I wanted to do was, you know, kind of coming into this from an engineer,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.240]   give you a perspective of what is it like from somebody looking at the
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.500]   regulatory side on vehicle safety and how are they thinking about the
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.600]   technologies you're developing and where does that actually leave some
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.700]   opportunities for engineers to make some big contributions to society. So let's
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.840]   start with what vehicle safety is like today. So today we have a system of
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.480]   federal motor vehicle safety standards. So these are rules, they're minimum
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.600]   performance requirements, and each of them must have associated with it an
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.920]   objective test. So you can tell does a vehicle meet this requirement or does it
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.280]   not meet this requirement. Now interestingly there is no federal agency
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.480]   that is testing vehicles before they are sold. We rely in this country on a system
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.320]   of manufacturer self-certification. So the government puts these rules out
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.240]   there and manufacturers go, "We got this, we can meet this," and then they
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.440]   self-certify and put the vehicles out on the market. The National Highway Traffic
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.960]   Safety Administration can then purchase vehicles and test them and make sure
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.240]   that they comply. But we rely on manufacturer self-certification. This is
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.040]   a different system than in most of the rest of the world, which actually has
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.400]   pre-market certification, where before you can sell it the government agency
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.320]   has to say, "Yes, we've checked it and it meets all the requirements." Aviation in
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.760]   this country, for instance, has that. Aircraft require certification before
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.480]   they can be sold. Cars do not. Now where did that system come from? So a little
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.320]   quick history lesson. In 1965 Ralph Nader released a book entitled "Unsafe at Any
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.200]   Speed." And this is often thought of as a book about the Corvair. It's not.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.040]   The Corvair featured prominently in there as an example of a design that
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.240]   Nader considered to be unsafe. What was very interesting about this book
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.960]   was that he was actually advocating for things like airbags and anti-lock brakes
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.480]   back in 1965. These technologies didn't come along until much later. His
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.880]   argument was that the auto industry had failed. It wasn't a failure of
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.840]   engineering, but it was a failure of imagination. And if you're interested in
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.280]   vehicle safety, I would really recommend you read this book because it's
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.160]   fascinating. They have quotes from people in the 1960s basically saying that we
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.000]   believe that any collision more than about 40 or 45 miles an hour is not
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.200]   survivable. Therefore, there's no reason for seatbelts. There's no reason for
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.560]   collapsible steering wheels. In fact, there's a quote from somebody who made
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.360]   great advances in road safety saying, "I can't conceive of what help a seatbelt
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   would give you beyond like firmly bracing yourself with your hands." Those
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.680]   of you who have studied physics know that's kind of patently ridiculous. But
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.600]   there was a common feeling that there was no sense of doing anything about
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.680]   vehicle crash worthiness because once you got above a certain speed, it was
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   inherently unsurvivable. And I think it's interesting to look at that today because
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.040]   if we were to be in a collision, I think if any of us were to be in a collision
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.680]   around about 40 miles an hour in a modern automobile, we'd probably expect
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.440]   to walk away. You know, we wouldn't really be thinking about our survival. And so
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.160]   what this did is it led to a lot of public outcry and ultimately the
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.680]   National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in 1966, which established
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.560]   NHTSA and established this set of federal motor vehicle safety standards.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.000]   Now the process to get a new standard made, which is a rule-making process in
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.440]   government, is very time-consuming. Optimistically, about the minimum time it
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:39.160]   can possibly take is two years. Realistically, it's more like seven. And
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.520]   so if you think about going through this process, that's really problematic. I mean,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.800]   think about what we were talking about with automated vehicles two years ago or
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   seven years ago. And think about trying to start seven years ago and make laws
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.560]   that are going to determine how those vehicles operate on the road today. It's
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.480]   crazy, right? There's really no way to do that. And the other thing is is that if
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.960]   you think about it, our system evolved from really this sense of failure of
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.600]   imagination that the government needs to say, "Hey, industry, do this. Stop slacking
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.680]   off. These are the requirements. Get there." But I think it's hard to argue today
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.480]   with all the advances in automation that there is any failure of imagination on
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.320]   the part of industry. People are coming up with all sorts of ideas and concepts
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.120]   for new transportation and automation. Tech companies, startup companies, large
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.480]   OEMs. There's all sorts of concepts being tested out on the road. It's hard to
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.160]   argue that there's still any lack of imagination. Now the question is, are
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.680]   things like this legal? It's an interesting question, right? Can I
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.160]   actually legally do this? Well, from the federal level, there's an interesting
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.480]   report that came out about 10 months ago from the folks across the street at
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.720]   Volpe who did a scan and said, "Well, what are the things that might prevent you,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.960]   based on the current federal motor vehicle safety standards, from putting an
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.660]   automated vehicle out on the road?" And the answer was, honestly, not much. If you
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.080]   have a vehicle, if you start and you automate a vehicle that is currently
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.640]   meeting all the standards, because there are no standards that relate
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.880]   specifically to automation, you can certify your vehicle as meeting the
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.480]   federal motor vehicle safety standards. Therefore, there's nothing at the federal
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.720]   level that prevents, in general, an automated vehicle from being put on the
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.960]   road. So it makes sense. So if there isn't a safety standard that you have to meet,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.840]   then you can put a vehicle out on the road that meets all the existing ones
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.080]   and does something new, and there's no federal barrier to that. Now there are a
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.960]   couple of exceptions. There were a few points in there that referenced a driver,
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.040]   and in fact NHTSA gave an interpretation of the rule, which is one of the
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.160]   things that they can do, is to say, "Well, we're going to give an interpretation.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.200]   It's not making a new rule, but basically interpreting the ones that we have." And
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.040]   they said that actually these references to the driver could, in fact, refer to the
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.000]   AI system. And so that actually is now a policy statement from the
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.960]   department, that many of the references to driver in the federal motor vehicle
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.340]   safety standards can be replaced with your self-driving AI system, and the
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.240]   rules applied accordingly. So in fact, there's very little that prevents you
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.700]   from putting a vehicle out on the road if it meets the current standards. So if
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.600]   it's a modern production car, automate it. Federal motor vehicle safety standards
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.680]   don't stop that. Now a lot of the designs that I showed, though, things that
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.200]   wouldn't have a steering wheel or other things, are actually not compliant,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.840]   because there are requirements that you have a steering wheel, that you have
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.480]   pedals. Again, these are best practices that evolved in the days, of course, when
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.580]   people were not thinking of cars that could drive themselves. And so these
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.960]   things would require an exemption by NHTSA, a process of saying that, "Okay,
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.160]   this vehicle is allowed on the road, even though it doesn't meet the current
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.680]   standards because it meets some equivalent." And setting that equivalent
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.900]   can be a bit of a challenge. Okay, so the question then is, "Well, all right, if the
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.740]   federal government is responsible, and NHTSA, by the Traffic Safety Act, is
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.760]   responsible for safety on the roads, but it can't prevent people from putting
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.360]   anything out, what do you do?" Right? One approach is to say, "Well, let's get some
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.400]   federal motor vehicle safety standards out there." But as we already said, that's
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.960]   probably about a seven-year process, and if you were to start setting in best
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.240]   practices now, what would that look like? So we've got this challenge. We want to
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.640]   encourage this technology to come out onto the roads and be tested, because
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.840]   that's the way you're going to learn, to get the real-world data, to get the
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.400]   real-world experience. At the same time, the federal government is responsible
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.640]   for safety on the nation's roads. It can recall things that don't work. So if you
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.200]   do put your automated system out on the highway, and it's deemed to present an
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.440]   unreasonable risk to safety, even if you're an aftermarket manufacturer, the
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.640]   government can tell you to take that off the road. But the question is, "How can you
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:03.280]   do better? How can you be proactive to try to have a discussion here?" So we
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.400]   know standards are maybe not the best way of doing that, because they're too
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.120]   slow. We'd like to make sure the public is protected, but this technology gets
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.320]   tested. And so the approach taken to sort of provide some encouragement for this
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.720]   innovation, while at the same time looking at safety, was the federal
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.040]   automated vehicle policy, which rolled out in September. So this was an attempt
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.000]   to really say, "Okay, let's put out a different framework from the federal
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.720]   motor vehicle safety standards. Let's actually put out a system of voluntary
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:41.000]   guidance." So what NHTSA is doing is to ask manufacturers to voluntarily follow
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.440]   certain guidance and submit to the agency a letter that they have followed
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.000]   a certain safety assessment. Now the interesting thing is, is that the way
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.200]   that this is set up is not to tell manufacturers how to do something, but
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   really to say, "These are the things that we want you to address, and we want you
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.160]   to come to us to explain how you've addressed them." With the idea that from
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.720]   this, best practices will emerge, and we'll be able to figure out in the future what
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.880]   really is the best way of ensuring some of these safety items. So this rolled out
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:19.320]   in September. We've got the MIT car here on the side. So you see you've got
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.960]   the Massachusetts license plate. So thanks to Brian for bringing that. If you
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.280]   do put Gaudi stickers on your car, then you get closer to the center. So that's
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.200]   something to consider for future reference. But this was was rolled
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.120]   out in Washington, Washington DC by the Secretary and consists largely of
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.280]   multiple parts, but I think the most relevant to vehicle design is this 15
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.480]   point safety assessment. So these are the 15 points that are assessed, and
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.600]   I'd like to kind of talk about a few of these in some more detail. And it starts
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.760]   with this concept of an operational design domain and minimal risk or
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.240]   fallback conditions. And what that means is instead of trying to put a taxonomy
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.760]   on here and say, "Well, your automation system could be an adaptive cruise
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.240]   control that works on the highway, or it could be fully self-driving, or it might
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.440]   be something that operates a low-speed shuttle," the guidance asks the
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.660]   manufacturers to define this. And the definition is known as operational
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.440]   design domain. So in other words, you tell us where your system is supposed to work.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.400]   Is it supposed to work on the highway? Is it supposed to work in restricted areas?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.240]   Can it work in all weather? Or is this sort of something that operates only in
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.760]   daylight hours in the sunshine in this area of South Florida? All of those are
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.540]   fine, but it's incumbent upon the manufacturer or developer to define the
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.720]   operational design domain. And then once you've defined where the system operates,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.320]   you need to define how you make sure that it is only operating in those
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.280]   conditions. How do you make sure that the system stays there? And what's your
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.440]   fallback in case it doesn't? And that fallback can be different. Obviously, if
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.020]   this is a car which is normally human-driven, as you see here from the
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:11.800]   Volvo Drive Me experiment, it might be reasonable to say, "We're going to ask the
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:17.520]   human driver to retake control." Whereas, clearly, if you're going to enable blind
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.920]   passengers or you are going to have a vehicle that has no steering wheel, you
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.000]   need a different fallback system. And so within the guidance, it really allows
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   manufacturers to have a lot of different concepts of what they want their
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.480]   automation to be, so long as they can define where it works, what the fallback
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.200]   is in the event that it doesn't work, and how you have educated the consumer
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.160]   about what your technology does and what it doesn't do, so that people have a good
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.080]   understanding of the system performance. A few things, if we go down, you see also
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.720]   validation methods and ethical considerations are aspects that are
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.000]   brought up here as well. And so validation methods are really
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.920]   interesting as it applies to AI. So really, the idea is that there's lots of
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.120]   different ways that you might test an automated vehicle. You might go out on a
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.080]   test track and run it through a series of standard maneuvers. You may develop a
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.320]   certain number of miles of experience driving in real-world traffic and figure
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.960]   out how does the vehicle behave in a limited environment. There's questions
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.400]   about a test track, obviously, because you don't have the sort of unknowns that can
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.480]   happen in the real-world environment. But if you test in one real-world
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.600]   environment, you also have a question of, is this transferable information? So if
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.400]   I've driven a certain number of miles in Mountain View, California, does that tell
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.480]   me anything about how the vehicle is likely to behave in Cambridge,
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   Massachusetts? Maybe, maybe not. It's a little bit hard to extrapolate
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.520]   sometimes. And then finally, there's also the idea of simulation and analysis. So
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.240]   if I can record these situations, if I can actually create a virtual environment
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.880]   of the sorts of things that I see on the road, maybe I can actually run the
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.640]   vehicle through many, many of these scenarios, perturbed in some way, and
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.840]   actually test the system much more robustly in simulation than I could ever
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.720]   actually do out on the road. So the guidance is actually neutral on which of
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.320]   these techniques manufacturers take and allow manufacturers to approach it in
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.440]   different ways. And I think, you know, based upon conversations, when you think
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.560]   about the way customers or companies develop this, they do take all these
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.880]   different approaches. A company like Tesla, for instance, which is recording
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.400]   all the data streams from all their vehicles, basically, is able to run ideas
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.240]   or technologies silently in their vehicle. They can actually test systems
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.800]   out, get real-world data, and then decide whether or not to make that system
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.600]   active. Companies that don't have that access to data really can't use that
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.480]   sort of development method and may rely much more heavily on simulation or
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.280]   test-track experience. So the guidance really doesn't have a particular blend
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.880]   of this, and in fact, it does envision that you might have over-the-air software
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.120]   updates in the future. So it is interesting, though, to think about
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.360]   whether you have data-driven approaches, things like artificial neural networks,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.600]   or whether you actually start to program in hard and fast rules. Because as you
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.320]   start to think about requirements on a system, how do you actually set
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.840]   requirements on a system which has learned its behavior, and you don't
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:30.480]   necessarily know what the internal workings or algorithms look like. There's
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.800]   another one that comes up, which is the ethical considerations. I'm going
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.600]   to pick on MIT for a moment here. So this is an area that I actually did a lot of
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.960]   work on with Stanford together with some philosophers who joined
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.920]   our group. And so when people hear ethical considerations in automated
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.600]   vehicles, it often conjures up the trolley car problem. And so this sort
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.880]   of classic formulation here about the fact that you have a self-driving car
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.720]   which is heading towards a group of ten people, and it can either plow in and
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.840]   kill those ten people, or it can divert and kill the driver. What do you do? And
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:12.880]   these are classic questions in philosophy. You actually look, in fact, at
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.960]   the trolley car problem, which is I have a runaway trolley car, and I need to
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.080]   either divert it to another track, or it will kill somebody who's wandering
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.640]   across that track, or the five people on the trolley car are killed. What do I do?
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.520]   Well, in fact, as this article points out, it's like, you know, before
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.200]   automated vehicles can become widespread, car makers must solve an
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.360]   impossible ethical dilemma of algorithmic morality. So if all this
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.440]   wasn't hard enough, I mean, you're understanding how tough the technology
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   is to actually program this stuff, and then you have to get the regulations
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.840]   right, and now we actually have to solve impossible philosophical questions. Well,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.480]   I don't think that's actually true, and I think, you know, it's good for
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:59.920]   engineers to work with philosophers, but not to be so literal about this. This is
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.560]   a question that philosophers can ask, but engineers might ask a number of
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   different questions, like, who's responsible for the brakes on this
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.440]   trolley? Why wasn't there a backup system? I mean, why am I headed into a group of
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:18.520]   ten people without any capability to stop? So an engineer would, in fact, have
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.400]   to answer this question, but might approach it much differently. So if I
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.040]   look at the trolley car problem, I might say, okay, let's see, my options are I've
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.440]   got a trolley car which is out of control. First of all, I'd like to have an
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.760]   emergency braking system. Let's make sure that I have that. Well, there's a chance
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.160]   that that could break as well. So if my emergency, if my base braking system
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.080]   goes, and my emergency braking system goes, my next option would be to divert
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.640]   it to this side track. Well, knowing that that's my option, I should probably put
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.120]   up a fence with a warning sign that says, "Do not cross runaway trolley track." Okay,
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.360]   now let's say that I've done all of that. The brakes fail, the emergency
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.720]   brakes fail. I have to divert the trolley, and somebody has ignored my sign and
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.600]   crossed over the fence, and now is hit by the trolley. Do I feel a little
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.640]   differently about this whole scenario than I did at the beginning of just
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.240]   trying to decide who lived and who died? The solution was made, but by thinking of
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.400]   it as an engineer trying to reduce risk, and not by thinking of levels of
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.820]   morality and who deserves to live or die. And so I think this is a very important
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.960]   issue, and the reason it's in the guidance is not to basically have
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.920]   everybody solve trolley car problems, but to try to think about these larger
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:37.840]   issues. And so I think ethics is not just about these sorts of situations, which
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.280]   actually will be in automated vehicles, I think addressed much more by engineering
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.760]   principles than by trying to figure out from philosophical merits who deserves
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.200]   to live and die. But there's broader issues here. Just any time that you have
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.920]   concern for human safety. How close do I get to pedestrians? How close do I get to
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:03.280]   bicycles? How much care should I put in to other people in the environment?
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.880]   That's very much an ethical question, and it's an ethical question that
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.280]   manufacturers are actually already addressing today. If you look at the
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.320]   automatic emergency braking systems that most manufacturers are putting on their
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.240]   vehicles, they will actually use a different algorithm depending upon
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.000]   whether that obstacle in front of it is a vehicle or a human. So they're already
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.880]   detecting and making a decision that the impact of this vehicle with a human
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.520]   could be far worse than the impact of this vehicle with a vehicle, and so
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.560]   they're choosing to brake a little bit more heavily in that case. That's
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.640]   actually where these ethical considerations come in, and the idea of
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.920]   the guidance is to begin to share and have a discussion openly about how
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.840]   manufacturers are approaching this with the idea of getting to a best practice
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.440]   where not only the people in the automated vehicles, but other road users
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.320]   feel that there's an appropriate level of care taken for their well-being.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.720]   That's one of the areas where ethics is important. The other area where ethics is
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.520]   important is that we have different objectives as we drive down the road. We
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.200]   have objectives for safety, we'd like to get there. We have objectives for
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.360]   mobility, we'd like you to get there probably pretty quickly. And we also have
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.160]   the idea of legality, we'd like to follow the rules. But sometimes these things
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.720]   come into conflict with each other. So let's say you're driving down the road
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.600]   and there's a van that's parked where it has absolutely no business parking.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:28.120]   You've got a double yellow line. Is it okay to cross? Well, at least in
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.560]   California, there's no exception to the double yellow line representing the lane
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.640]   boundary for a vehicle that's parked where it has no business being parked. So
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.360]   according to the vehicle code, you're supposed to kind of come to a stop here.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.720]   I don't think any of us would, right? In fact, actually when you're in
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.080]   California and you're riding through the hills and you come upon a cyclist,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.920]   virtually every vehicle on the road is deviating across the double yellow line
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.800]   to give extra room to the cyclist. That's also not what you're supposed to do by
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.240]   the vehicle code. You're supposed to stay on your side of the double yellow line
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:10.560]   but slow to an appropriate speed to pass. All right? So there's behaviors where our
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.720]   desire for mobility or our desire for safety are outweighing our desire for
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.200]   legality. This becomes a challenge if you think about how do I program the
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.320]   self-driving car. Should it be based on the way that humans drive or should it
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.080]   be based on the way that the legal code tells me to drive? Of course, the legal
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.000]   code was never actually anticipating a self-driving car. From a human standpoint,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.240]   that double yellow line is a great shorthand that says maybe there's
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.080]   something coming up here where you don't want to be in this other lane. But if I
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.560]   actually have a car with the sensing capability to make that determination
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.840]   itself, is the double yellow line actually all that meaningful anymore?
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.080]   These are things that have to be sorted out. Speed limits being another one. You
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.720]   know, if we're out on the highway, it's usually a little bit flexible. Do we give
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.800]   that same flexibility to the automated vehicle or do we create these wonderful
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.000]   automated vehicle roadblocks of vehicles going to the speed limit when nobody
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.040]   else around them is? Do we allow them to accelerate a little bit to merge into
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.120]   the flow of traffic? Do we allow vehicles to speed if they could avoid an accident?
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.600]   Is our desire for safety greater than our desire for legality? These are the
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.160]   sort of ethical questions that I think are really important. These are things
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.840]   that need to be talked through because I believe if we actually have vehicles
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.920]   that follow the law, nobody will want to drive with them. And so we need to think
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.880]   about either ways of giving flexibility to the vehicles or to the law in the
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.760]   sense that vehicles can drive like humans do. So this brings up some really
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.680]   interesting areas, I think, with respect to learning and programming. And so the
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.000]   question is, you know, should our automated vehicles drive like humans and
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.120]   exhibit the same behavior that humans do? Or should they drive like robots and
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.320]   actually execute the way that the law tells them that they should drive?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.880]   Obviously fixed rules can be one solution to this. Behavior learned from
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.720]   human drivers could be another solution to this. We might have some sort of
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:13.480]   balance of different objectives that we do more analytically in terms of how
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.560]   much we want to obey the double yellow line when there are other things
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.320]   influencing it in the environment. Now what's interesting is that as you start
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.080]   to think about this, there's limits to any of these approaches in the extreme.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.920]   You know, as we found with our self-driving race car, if you're not
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.400]   learning from experience, you're not making use of all the data. You're not
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.720]   going to do as well. And there's no way that you can possibly pre-program an
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:41.480]   automated vehicle for every scenario it's going to encounter. Somehow you have
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.640]   to think about interpolating. Somehow you have to think about learning. At the same
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.280]   time you can say, well why don't we just measure humans? Well, human error is
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:56.400]   actually the cause or a factor, the primary factor in 94% of accidents.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.400]   It's either a lack of judgment or some lack of perception on the part of the
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.360]   human. So if we're simply following humans, we're actually only learning how
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.040]   well humans can do things. We're leaving a lot on the table in terms of the
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.520]   potential of the car. And so this is a really interesting discussion that I
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.400]   think will continue to be both in the development side of these vehicles and
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.920]   the policy side. What is the right balance? What do I want to learn versus
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:29.560]   what do I want to program? How do I avoid leaving anything on the table here? So
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.880]   because it's the point where, you know, I've had a bunch of slides with words
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.720]   here, I want to give people a little bit of a sense for what you could be leaving
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:46.200]   on the table if in fact you don't adapt. This is Marty. Marty is a DeLorean that
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.760]   we've been working with in my lab. Now DeLoreans are really fantastic cars
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:57.000]   unless you want to accelerate, brake, or turn. It really didn't do any of those
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.760]   things terribly well. There's no power steering, there's an underpowered engine,
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.280]   and very small brakes. All of these things are fixable. In fact, what's nice
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.640]   about the DeLorean is it separates quite nicely. The whole fiberglass tub comes up.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.000]   You can take out the engine. You can take out the brakes. You can make some
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.400]   modifications to the frame, stiffen the suspension, work with Renovo Motors, a
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:31.480]   startup in Silicon Valley, to put in a new electric drivetrain and put it all
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.280]   back together. And when you do, you come up with a car that's actually pretty
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.960]   darn fun. And one we've programmed to drive itself. This is Adam Savage from
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.560]   Mythbusters going along for a drive.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.120]   And what you see is Marty doing something at a level of precision that
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.720]   we're pretty sure no human driver can meet. JR said there's no way he can do
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:04.240]   this. You see it's going into a perfect drift, doing a perfect donut around this
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:13.960]   cone, and then it launches itself through the next gate, sideways into the next
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.760]   cone. Now it's doing this, you see it shoots through the gate, missing those
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.320]   cones, and then launches into a tight circle around the next cone. It's
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.400]   actually doing this as sort of an algorithm similar to orbital mechanics,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.960]   if you think about how it's actually orbiting these different
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   points as it sets a trajectory. Now the limit on this is tires, as you can see as
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.760]   it comes around here. The tires disintegrate into many chunks flying at
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:45.080]   the camera as we do this. But the ability of the car to really continue, even as
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.040]   the tires heat up, to execute this pretty nice trajectory. Here you see it
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.720]   going through the gates again and launching into a stable equilibrium,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.760]   putting pretty much the tire tracks right over where they were in the
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:03.880]   previous run, and then finally ending. So this is the sort of thing that I think
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.520]   is possible. As you look at these vehicles, there's a huge potential out
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.120]   there for these things to not drive about as well as an average human, but to
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.960]   far exceed human performance in their abilities to use all the capabilities of
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.520]   the tires to do some amazing things. Now maybe that's not the way that you want
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.120]   your daily drive to go, although when we first posted some of this
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.280]   video, one of the commenters was like, "I want this car. That way I can go
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.760]   into the store to buy donuts while it sits in the parking lot doing donuts."
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.520]   It wasn't a use case that I had thought of, but that's one of the
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.960]   things that we thought of is really how if you limit yourself to only thinking
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.000]   about what the tires can do before they get to the saturation of the friction
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.320]   of the road, you're only taking into account one class of trajectories.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.400]   There's a lot more beyond that that could be very advantageous in some
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.460]   emergency situations. Wouldn't it be great if the car had access to that?
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.760]   That's not a way that we're going to get if we only sort of monitor day-to-day
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.680]   driving. We're not going to get that capability in our cars. So one other
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:15.320]   aspect that came through in the policy, which I think is extremely
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   important as we think about neural networks and learning, is this idea of
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.520]   data sharing. And there's a huge potential to accelerate the development
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.480]   of automated vehicles if we can share some information about edge case
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.760]   scenarios in particular. So if you think about trying to train a neural network
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.440]   to handle some extreme situations, that's really much easier if your set of
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.640]   training data contains those extreme situations. So if you think about
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.280]   the weird things that can happen out on the road, if you had a database of those
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.480]   and those comprised your training set, you'd have a head start in terms of
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.880]   being able to get a neural network and begin to validate that it would work in
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.120]   these situations. So the question is, is there a way for the ecosystem
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.040]   around self-driving cars to actually share some of this information so that
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:06.760]   different players can actually share some information about the critical
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.920]   situations and be able to make sure that if you learn something, that yes, you can
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:15.680]   make your cars safer, but actually all the cars out on the road get safer. Now
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.760]   clearly you need to balance this with some other considerations. There's
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.880]   the intellectual property concerns of the company. There's privacy concerns of
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.480]   any individuals who might be involved. But it does seem to me that there's a
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.000]   big potential here to think about ways of sharing certain data that can
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.240]   contribute to safety. And this is a discussion that's going to be ongoing
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.840]   and I think academia can do a lot to sort of help broker this discussion
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.760]   because, you know, the first level people say, you know, data sharing, I don't know,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.120]   companies aren't going to share, we're not going to get the information we need.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.240]   But most of the time people stay in the abstract as opposed to saying, well, what
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.600]   information would be most helpful? What information is really going to give
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.720]   people confidence in the safety of these cars? It's going to let regulators
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.120]   understand how they operate and yet at the same time is going to protect the
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.320]   amount of development effort that companies put in there. I think there is
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.720]   a solution here and in fact if you look at aviation, there's a really good
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   example that already exists. It's known as the Asias system. It started with only
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.280]   four airlines that decided to share safety information with each other. And
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.520]   this goes through MITRE, which is a federally funded R&D center. And it's
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.080]   actually now up to 40 airlines. And if companies get kicked out of the MITRE
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.560]   project, they really try very hard to get back in. Now this is anonymized data.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   It's anonymized data so that, you know, companies actually get an assessment of
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.120]   what their safety record is like and they can compare it to other airlines in
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.520]   the abstract, but they can't compare it to any identifiable airline. So there's
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   no ranking of this. It's not used for any enforcement techniques. And it took
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.760]   people a long time to kind of build up and begin to share that. But now there's
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.720]   a huge amount of trust and they're sharing more and more data and looking
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.560]   at ways that they can perhaps actually start to code in things like weather and
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.080]   time of day, which had been removed for anonymization purposes in the original
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.480]   version of the system. So I think there's some good examples out there and this is
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.820]   something that's very important to think about for automated vehicles. And I think
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.560]   as this discussion goes forward, those of you who are interested in developing
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.880]   these vehicles, using techniques that rely on data are going to be an
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:31.120]   important voice for the importance of data sharing. I think there's a
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.160]   large role here to kind of make people aware that this actually does have value
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.960]   in the larger ecosystem. So this is something that I was able to work on
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:46.320]   more broadly as well. So I was part, and I was the DOT representative on the
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.680]   National Science and Technology Committee's subcommittee on machine
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.040]   learning and artificial intelligence. And this was one of the recommendations that
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.240]   was really pushed forward as well because AI has tended to really make
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.680]   great advances with the availability of good data sets. And in order to make
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.480]   those sort of good advances in transportation, this group was also
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:14.200]   advocating that those data sets need to be made broadly available. So this is a
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   little bit about the vision behind the automated vehicle policy, what the goal
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.960]   was to really achieve here. The idea of trying to move towards a proactive safety
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.760]   culture, not to necessarily put in regulations prematurely and try to set
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.040]   standards when honestly we don't know the best way to develop automated
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.920]   vehicles, but to allow the government to kind of get involved in discussions with
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.480]   manufacturers early and be comfortable with what's going out on the roadway. And
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.280]   actually to kind of help the U.S. to continue to play a leading role in this.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.440]   Obviously if vehicles were going to be banned from the roads, it would be very
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.240]   difficult for the country to continue to be a place where people could test
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.140]   and develop this technology. And then the belief really that there can be an
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.640]   acceleration of the safety benefits of this through data sharing. So each car
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:10.520]   doesn't have to encounter all the weird situations itself, but in fact can learn
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:16.000]   from what other vehicles experience. And the idea is that really this is meant to
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.520]   be an evolving framework. So it comes out as guidance, it really generates
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.600]   conversations, it generates best practices, which can eventually evolve
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:29.680]   into standards and law. And there's a huge opportunity here because the belief
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.040]   isn't that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will be doing all
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.680]   of the development of these best practices, but that that'll really evolve
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.520]   from what companies do and what all of us at universities are able to do to
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.880]   sort of generate ways to solve these problems in creative manners. Ways to
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.160]   actually keep the innovation going, but ensure that we have safety. So as you
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.320]   start to think about all of the AI systems that you're developing, you
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.960]   start to flip around a little bit and think about how is the regulator going
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.200]   to get comfortable, that it's not going to do something weird. These are great
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.340]   research questions. I think these are great practical questions and these are
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.720]   things that will need to be worked out going forward. So I leave you with that
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.040]   as a challenge to think about, to think as you take this course, not only about
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.920]   the technology that you're learning, but how do you communicate that to other
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.400]   people? And where are the gaps that need to be filled? Because I think you'll find
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.840]   some great opportunities for research, startup companies, and ultimately
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.040]   work with policy and government there. So thanks for the opportunity to talk to
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.280]   all of you, and I want to stop there because probably the things that you
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.160]   want to talk about are more interesting than the things that I wanted to talk
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.400]   about. So I'm happy to take questions along there.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:50.520]   We had a quick hand here.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:41:09.520]   [Question]
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:15.000]   I do. I think that's a great question. Thanks for reminding me.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.200]   So the question was whether in the future when you have all vehicles
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.640]   automated, would we be able to actually roll back things like airbags and seat
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.040]   belts and other things that we have on there, what we might know as passive
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.320]   safety devices in vehicles. I believe that we will, and in fact actually one of
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.280]   the things that I think is most extraordinary, if you think about this
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.080]   from a sustainability standpoint, when you look at the average sort of mass of
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.280]   vehicles and average occupancy of vehicles in the U.S., you know, with
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.120]   passenger cars we're using maybe about 90% of the energy to move the vehicle as
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.560]   opposed to moving the people inside. And one of the reasons for that is crash
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.700]   worthiness standards, which are great because that's what's enabled us to be
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.680]   surviving these crashes at 40 miles an hour. But if we do have vehicles that are
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.840]   not going to crash or if they are going to have certain modes which might be
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:12.200]   designed with very carefully designed, you know, crash areas or things like
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.920]   this, we can potentially take a lot of that mass out. Particularly if these are
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.320]   low-speed vehicles which are designed only for the urban environment and
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   they're not going to crash because they're going to drive, you know,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.000]   somewhat conservatively or in some ways separated from pedestrians, then I think
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.320]   you can get a lot of the mass out and then you start to actually have
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.640]   transportation options which, you know, from an environmental standpoint are
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.760]   comparable to cycling. So I think that's actually a really
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.440]   good goal to strive for, although we either have to kind of limit the
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.520]   environment or think in the far future with some of those techniques.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:43:07.120]   Good. Yeah, that's a great question. So what are we doing with
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.080]   Shelly? Is our mission really just to drive as fast as possible and faster
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.320]   than a human or are we trying to learn from this something that we can apply to
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:21.560]   other automated vehicles? It really is a desire to learn from other automated, you
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.520]   know, for the development of other automated vehicles. And we've often said
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.240]   that at the point where, you know, the difference between Shelly's performance
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.440]   and the human driver, you know, starts to be really mundane things like, you know,
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.200]   our shift pattern or something which isn't applicable, we kind of lose
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.000]   interest at that. However, you know, up to this point, every insight that we've
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.640]   gotten from Shelly has been directly transferable. And we've programmed the
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.000]   car to do some emergency lane changes in situations where you don't have enough
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.960]   room to brake. And we've actually been demonstrating in some cases that the car
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   can do this much faster than a human, even an expert human's response can be.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.600]   So there's certain scenarios that we've done like that. And I would say from the
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.360]   bigger picture, what's really fascinating is that we originally started out with
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.800]   this idea of let's find the best path around the track and track it as close
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.880]   as we can. But in fact, when you look at human race car drivers, what they're
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.040]   doing is actually very different. They're pushing the car to the limits and then
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.720]   sort of seeing what paths that opens up to them. And it flips the problem a bit
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.640]   on its head in a way that I think is actually very applicable for developing
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.360]   safety systems out on the road. But it's not a way that people have looked at it,
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.040]   to the best of my knowledge, up to this point. And so, you know, that's really what
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.560]   we're hoping is that the inspiration in trying to reproduce human performance
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.080]   there leads us to better safety algorithms. So long, you know, so far
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.760]   that's been the case. And when that ceases to be the case, I think we are
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.280]   definitely much less interested.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   [Question from audience]
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.680]   Yeah, so liability is a good question. So, you know, what, who is liable, if I can
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.320]   sort of rephrase, you know, for an accident in an automated vehicle.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.240]   On the one hand, that's kind of an open question. On the other hand, we do have a
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.160]   court system. And so whenever there are new technologies, these things are
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.280]   actually generally figured out in the courts and it can be different from
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.640]   state to state. So this is one aspect where, you know, potentially some
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.960]   discussion so that manufacturers aren't subject to different conditions in
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.560]   different states would be helpful. But the way that it works now is that it's
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:40.640]   it's usually not binary. We have in the U.S. the sense of a joint and several
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:46.120]   liability. And so you can actually assign different portions of responsibility to
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.520]   different players in the game. You have had companies like Volvo and, in fact,
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.960]   Google make statements that if their vehicles are involved in accidents, then
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.480]   they would expect to be liable for it. So people have often talked about needing
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.360]   something really new for liability, but I'm not sure that's the case. We do have
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.880]   a court system that can ultimately figure out who is liable with new
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.760]   technologies. We have some manufacturers that are starting to make some
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.120]   statements about assuming product liability for that. The one thing that
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.400]   really could be helpful, as I mentioned, is perhaps some harmonization. Because
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.600]   right now insurance is something that is set state by state. And so the rules in
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:30.080]   one state as to who's at fault for an accident may be very different in
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.680]   another state.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:57.160]   [Question]
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.720]   Okay, so what if companies, you know, as they send in the safety letters, are
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.840]   using criteria to set safety that may not be broadly acceptable to the
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.760]   public, where the public would like these vehicles to have greater safety? I think,
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.080]   you know, the nice thing about this process is, first of all, we would know
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:22.320]   that, right? So we would have a sense that companies are developing with certain
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.720]   measures of safety in mind, and there could actually be a discussion as to, you
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.640]   know, whether that is setting an acceptable level. It's a difficult
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.200]   question because it's not clear that people really know what an acceptable
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.440]   level is. Is it, does it have to be safer than than humans drive now? You know, my
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:48.560]   personal feeling, I would say yes. And does it have to be much, much safer? Well,
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.520]   that's hard to say. You know, you start to then get into this situation of, we're
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.640]   comfortable to a certain extent with our existing legal system and with the
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.000]   fact that humans could cause errors that have fatal consequences. Do we feel the
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.040]   same way about machines? All right, you know, we tend to think the machines
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.840]   really should have a higher level of perfection, so we may, as a society, be
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.760]   less tolerant. People will often say, well, so long as the overall national
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.200]   figures go down, that would be good, but that's really not going to matter much
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.880]   to the families who are impacted by an automated vehicle, particularly if it's
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:27.080]   a, if it's a scenario with very, very bad optics. What do I mean by that? It's, if
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.400]   you think about the failures of mechanical systems, because they're
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.600]   different than the failures of human beings, they can often, like, look really
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.900]   bad, right? If you sort of think about a vehicle that doesn't detect something
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.560]   and then just continues to plow ahead, you know, visually that's, that's really
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.520]   striking, and that's the sort of thing that, you know, would get replayed and be
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:53.040]   in people's consciousness and raise some fears, and so, you know, I think that's,
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:58.920]   that's an issue that's going to have to be, have to be sorted out.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   Yeah, my question is about automated vehicles on a global scale.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   You talked about, you know, data sharing and the potential for collaboration in terms of, you know, technology, but also maybe policy.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   Is there anything, you know, any sort of collaboration between different, you know,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   between research in different parts of the world to exchange, you know, different policies and different technologies?
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   Because, you know, it's very different.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   Yes, so that's a, that's a good question. What's being done, really, from a global
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.040]   standpoint to sort of share ideas, to share research, and to kind of work
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.200]   through some of these things, particularly on the policy side? So most
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.440]   of the auto manufacturers are global corporations, and so a lot of the
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.400]   research in this is done in very different parts of the world. So Renault,
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:52.000]   Nissan, for instance, is doing a lot in Silicon Valley, in Europe, and in Japan.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.240]   And I think you see a lot of that with the different manufacturers. One of the
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.200]   cool things that I got to do as part of my role was to go with the Secretary of
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.800]   Transportation to the G7 Transportation Ministers meeting in Japan and address
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:11.440]   the ministers about sort of the the U.S. policy on automated vehicles. And one of
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.040]   the parts of that discussion was, well, the U.S. has a very different set of
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.680]   rules. So we have this manufacturer self-certification as opposed to
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:25.360]   pre-market certification. But testing, for instance, is something that has to be
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.760]   done regardless. So either it's testing that's done by a manufacturer, or it's
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:35.840]   testing that's done by, for instance, you know, in Germany, the, the, the TÜV and
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:41.440]   other agencies that are responsible for, for road safety. And so the idea is maybe
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.960]   we should be sharing best practices on testing, so we have a set of standard
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.400]   tests. And then manufacturers across the globe could test to a certain set of
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.200]   standards that might be translated differently according to the policies
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   and regulatory environments in different countries. So that was, that was part of
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:04.480]   the idea that we advanced at the G7, and it seemed to kick off really well.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   [inaudible]
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.120]   I never had a conscious decision on this. I actually got a call from the White
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:15.880]   House one day. You know, and, and, you know, I got this message, or this email, you
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.080]   know, I'm, I'm reaching out from the White House for you to give my call, you know,
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.520]   give me a call back. So of course I called back immediately, and Pam Coleman on the
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.000]   other end of the line was like, "I love doing that." She's like, you know, when
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.880]   you're calling for the White House, everybody returns your call. And, and so
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.240]   honestly, you know, she said, "Here's the situation. We're looking at a lot of these
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.080]   areas in the Department of Transportation that seem to hit upon
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.920]   your areas of expertise. We want to talk about working with you in some way, the
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:45.040]   holy grail would be for you to come out and work in DC for a while." And then I
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.800]   got a call from the Department of Transportation, and they're like, "Well, we
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.880]   know you wouldn't want to come out to DC for a while." I'm like, "Try me. Could I do,
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.440]   you know, could I do cool stuff, and could I make an impact?" And then, you know, I
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.840]   met with the Secretary of Transportation out in San Francisco, and, you know, he
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.760]   assured me, he's like, "You would be surprised. You would be very surprised at
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:09.160]   how much of an impact you could have." And this ended up being really true. A lot of
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.040]   times this stuff moves quickly, and people who are involved in policymaking
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.560]   may or may not have a technical background in this. They may have come
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:20.120]   through the campaign, for instance, and then ended up in political roles. Yet the
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.960]   folks that I worked with were really trying to get good information and make
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.640]   good decisions. And so I just kept getting called in for advice on all
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.840]   sorts of things, and I found that people actually really wanted to have that
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:34.960]   technical information and then used it. So, so that, that's the way it happened.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.080]   It seemed like it was an opportunity to take things that I've worked on, as I
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.240]   mentioned, you know, automated vehicles since 1992, and then to be part of this
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.080]   policy development, which went really quickly. It was a one-page outline when I
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:50.760]   arrived in February, and then in September it rolled out. And along the
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.000]   way was all sorts of editing and negotiations at the White House and
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.920]   other agencies. Fascinating, fascinating process. So, so I kind of fell into this,
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.520]   but, you know, as Lex mentioned, I think I'm emerging as a policy wonk here
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.840]   because it was a, it was a very fun experience. Let's see over here, what we
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.520]   got? With data sharing, you have a lot of companies that have somewhat of a
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.720]   monopoly on a lot of data, especially like Google has so much more data
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.960]   available. Yeah. A lot of smaller startups. How do you incentivize these big
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.920]   companies to actually share their data? Good, so how do you incentivize companies to share
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:32.720]   their data when they have an awful lot in, invested in them, in that, in the
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.360]   gathering of that data and being able to process that data? And I think the answer
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.760]   is to start small and to try to say, are there certain high-value things that
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.480]   could, again, make the public comfortable, make policy makers comfortable, that
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:48.760]   really aren't going to be a burden on the company? You know, so, so one of the, you
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.080]   know, one of the things that, from the Peloton standpoint, that was bounced
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.920]   around at one point, so our, our trucks actually use vehicle-to-vehicle
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:01.560]   communications as part of their link. Well, when you do that, you discover that
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.920]   there's actually an awful lot of places where that drops out, because cell phone
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.080]   towers, which are not supposed to be broadcasting on that frequency, seem to
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.840]   create an awful lot of interference there. Well, that could be very
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.440]   interesting from a public policy perspective to know, you know, where are,
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:21.720]   you know, we were sort of monitoring for incursions in that, in that frequency
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.200]   range everywhere we go. That, for instance, might be a very useful piece of
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.880]   information to share with policy makers that wouldn't be any real proprietary
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:34.680]   issue to share from the company's perspective. And so I think that the
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.040]   trick is to start small and find what are the high-value data where there
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.720]   isn't a big issue of sharing. I mean, if you go to Google and say, "All right,
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.320]   Google, what will it take for you to share all of the data you're acquiring
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.840]   from your entire self-driving car program?" I guess Waymo now. I think that
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.560]   would be a very big number, and so I don't think that's a starting point. I
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.720]   think you start with, you know, what is the high-value data, data that's of high
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.880]   value for the public policy sense, and really minimal hassle to the, to the
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:08.840]   companies. I don't know how much longer you, I'm happy to stay and, and answer,
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:14.720]   answer as many questions, but I know you have a class to run. How are we? Okay,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.920]   good. Yes?
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:25.560]   Are there any efforts that you know to come up with standards for sharing map data, accident data, simulations?
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:32.000]   Good. So is there any effort underway for, for sharing map data, some of the edge
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.600]   case accident data, simulation capabilities, and things like that? This
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.720]   is one of the next steps that NHTSA outlined in the policy, and so there are
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.040]   people at, at NHTSA actually working on taking some of these next steps again in
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.240]   sort of a pilot or prototype mode. So, so that's something that's, that's currently
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.320]   being worked on in the, in the department. You can probably expect to hear more
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.360]   from in the not so distant future.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   Yes?
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   I have a question about the learning from data.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   Driving in the urban areas and driving in the highway and rural areas are very different. Do you see the federal government to make like a standard data set for like an air company, so that's good before they can take a car on production? Or do you see that you should be asking the company to do the test itself?
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:23.880]   Okay, so the question is, testing in urban and rural environments, or even driving in, in urban and rural environments, are very
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.920]   different. And should the, the government actually come up with a standard set of
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:33.240]   data that all companies have to attest to? I think one of the reasons that the
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.960]   policy was designed the way it was, was to make sure we had this concept of
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:43.920]   operational design domain. So, in fact, if the only area that I've mapped, and the
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:50.880]   only area that I want to drive is, say, in a campus environment, or in one quarter
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:55.000]   square mile, then, then the idea is that we would like the companies to explain
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.700]   how they handle the eventualities in that one quarter square mile, but they
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:04.040]   should really have no reason to handle other situations, right? Because their
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.320]   vehicle won't encounter that, so long as it's been designed to stay within its
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.400]   operational design domain. So, I think in the short term, you know, what you see is
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.480]   people often looking at hyperlocal solutions, or kind of the low-hanging
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.240]   fruit for, for a lot of automation. And even if you think about offering
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:27.320]   mobility as a service, if I'm gonna offer sort of an automated taxi, I'm probably
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:31.560]   gonna do that in a limited environment to start with. And so, if I'm only doing
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:36.280]   this in Cambridge, does it really matter if I can drive in Mountain View or not?
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.440]   And so, you know, I think the idea is to start with the definition of the
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.200]   operational design domain, with a data set that is appropriate for that
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:48.680]   operational design domain. And then, as people's design domains start to expand
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:53.560]   nationwide, then I think, you know, the idea of common data sets starts to be,
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.560]   starts to be interesting. Although, you know, there is a sense that no finite
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:02.440]   data set is really going to capture every eventuality. And so, you know, people
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.240]   will be able to develop, or sort of, you know, design to the test in some ways. Is
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.080]   that sufficient? I think it'll make people feel better, but I, I personally
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:15.320]   wonder how much value there is. You know, it's same with test track testing. I can
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.200]   think of 20 different tests that automated vehicles will have to pass, and
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:22.800]   people will design ways to pass all 20 of those tests. It may make some people
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   more comfortable, but it doesn't make me all that much more comfortable that
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:30.880]   they'd be able to handle a real-world situation. All right, let's see, one last
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.200]   hand up.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   [inaudible]
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.720]   Could you, could you make an open-source car under, okay, so the question is, could
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:02.120]   you make an open-source car under the, the guidance provided by US DOT? The
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:06.960]   question would be, you know, from a, from a practical question, you're supposed to
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.920]   submit a safety assessment letter, which is supposed to be signed by somebody
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   responsible for that. And so, an issue, if you were to open-source, would be, you
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.120]   know, do I use this module, and who is actually signing, signing off on that?
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.320]   Would I feel comfortable signing off on something which I then allowed to be
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:30.160]   open-source? I, you know, not a lawyer, but I would think that, you know, I don't
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.760]   think there would be anything that would prevent that if you had a development
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.080]   team that was doing that, and people who are willing to sign off on whatever
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:43.920]   version of the software was actually used in an open-source car. You know, I
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:49.000]   will say that the, the guidance does apply to universities or to, or to other
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.760]   groups that would be putting a car out on the road. And I think if you look
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:59.240]   through the 15 points, they're not really meant to be overly restrictive. In fact, I
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.800]   would argue that pretty much any group that is going to sort of put real people
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.000]   at risk by, by putting an automated vehicle out on the road should really
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.760]   have thought through these things. So I don't think it's a, I don't think it's a
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.440]   terribly high, high burden to, to meet. I think it would be, you know, it would be
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.680]   meetable by a group. It just, the question would be, you know, from the open-source
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   sense, how do you sort of trace who's responsible and who's signing off on that?
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.040]   All right. I think we gave those third graders a run for their money. Yeah,
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.480]   absolutely. Thank you so much. Let's give Chris a big hand.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.320]   Thanks a lot.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.720]   (applause)
