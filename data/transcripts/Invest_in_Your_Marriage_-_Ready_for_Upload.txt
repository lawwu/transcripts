[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.100]   ♪
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.500]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate your being here.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.900]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.300]   This is a special edition of the show, pre-recorded while I am traveling here during the last two weeks of September.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.100]   I wanted to make sure I left you with a show, but I wasn't able to prepare prior to my trip
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.800]   the normal shows that I would have liked to have left for you.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.300]   If this is your first time listening to the show, I'd encourage you, I hope you enjoy today's content.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300]   However, go back and check in the archives prior to the middle of September,
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.800]   or come back after, you know, the first of October,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.600]   and you'll be able to see and experience the more normal flow of the show.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   Or at least you'll find out what has so far become normal, which I'm sure it'll change in the future.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.900]   Today I'd like to share with you just a few thoughts that I have on alternative forms of investment.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.800]   And what I want to talk with you about today is investing in your marriage,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.500]   or if you're not currently married, investing in your relationships.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.200]   One of the things that bugs me a little bit is that when people hear the word investment,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.800]   they often think only of financial investments.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.700]   And I really feel this is short-sighted for us to do.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.100]   I'm married, and one of the things that I constantly think about is how can I invest in my marriage?
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.400]   Now, with marriage I can clearly justify this from a financial perspective.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.500]   If you are married, and if you divorce,
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.700]   that will be the most expensive thing that will ever happen to you, period.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.300]   Consider that.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.300]   I've worked with some divorced clients, and every one of them has confirmed it.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.000]   Maybe there's a couple out there that would disagree,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.200]   but most of the people who have been divorced would tell me that,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.900]   "Yeah, Joshua, that's pretty accurate, actually."
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900]   So I would encourage you, if you don't invest in your marriage,
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.300]   it will be the most expensive mistake that you can make.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.400]   So if you are choosing to spend all of your time optimizing something that's very important, by the way,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.300]   optimizing the expense ratios on your mutual funds,
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   or optimizing the cost of insurance on your home,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300]   if you're spending all your time there,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.400]   and that has you locked away in front of a computer,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.700]   and not investing in your relationship with your spouse,
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.900]   how much is that ultimately going to cost you?
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.000]   It costs you a lot.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Maybe it would be wise to spend some time considering how you can invest in your marriage.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.100]   Now, there are a number of different ways that this could go,
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.700]   and I don't know which way would speak to you.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.400]   I don't necessarily feel that it's my place to tell anybody else
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   what they should do with their marriage or with their life, even.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.900]   It's really not.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.700]   I'm responsible for mine.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.500]   I'm not responsible for yours.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.800]   I'm responsible for my marriage.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.100]   I'm not responsible for yours.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.500]   But what I would encourage you is to spend some time thinking about this.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.700]   For everything that we do, there is a cost,
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.000]   and that cost is the opportunity cost for the things that we do not do.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.900]   So you may look and say, "Well, I am investing in my family by working a lot of overtime to earn a lot of extra money."
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.300]   That may be true,
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.900]   and that may be appropriate at this stage in your life.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.500]   But if you are investing in a lot of overtime,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   that means that you are not investing in—
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.000]   let me not be so black and white—
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.300]   that could mean that you are also not investing in time with your family.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.400]   Now, it's important to me that I not be one or the other,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.900]   that I not present a false dichotomy.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.500]   Prior to now, at some point in the historical period,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.000]   the average work week was a 60-hour work week.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.700]   In my grandfather's day, I spoke with him when he was alive,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.300]   and when he was growing up, and when he was a young man,
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.400]   the normal work week for everybody was 60 hours.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   Ten hours per day, six days per week.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.300]   That was the standard.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.300]   So I would not be one to set an arbitrary limit on this.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.300]   I'm not saying that 60 hours is overwork,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.900]   and therefore you're neglecting your family.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.800]   I don't know if you are or not.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   I'm just saying that consider whether you're working in a way
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.500]   that is going to ultimately be counterproductive.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.000]   So consider, are you investing in your family in the way that you would like to be?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.100]   So that may be, again, working overtime.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.900]   That may also be some thoughts such as,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.100]   are you choosing to work when you don't need to work?
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.900]   You've heard me on the show talk about,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.600]   doesn't make any sense to me,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.200]   why young fathers and mothers would spend the golden years of their kids' life
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.500]   working to build their careers so that they can retire when their kids are dead,
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.700]   you know, out of the house and gone.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.500]   Hopefully not dead.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.900]   When the kids are out of the house and gone.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.500]   Why not spend that time pulled back to just about normal time,
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.100]   or the minimum possible,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.700]   or be free of work completely because of,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.800]   you know, in order to invest in your family.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.300]   My wife and I choose, my wife is home with the kids full time,
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.000]   and I'm working to be home with the kids full time.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.800]   I'm home full time.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.300]   I work from home.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.600]   I just am not, you know, I still have to put in my time at work.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.100]   But we're making lifestyle choices to invest in our family and in our relationship.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.600]   The money's dead and gone when you're dead and gone.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.000]   Doesn't do you any good.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   But you can use the money and do something good with it.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.200]   Consider is there a way that you can invest in your relationship with your spouse.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.700]   Consider is there a way that you can invest in,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.400]   maybe it's instituting a date night routine,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.500]   if that's something that speaks to you.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.800]   If it's investing in a marriage seminar,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.400]   if that's something that speaks to you.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.000]   If it's investing in a babysitter and a three-day weekend away.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.300]   If it's investing in sending the kids to grandma and grandpa's
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.900]   and having a staycation at home,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.000]   where you have a couple days at home.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.900]   These things do not have to be either money or relationship.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.400]   They can all be done inexpensively and enjoyably.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.000]   But you have to choose to be proactive.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.400]   And then consider if you're investing appropriately.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.900]   I get a bad rap I think in personal finance communities
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.600]   because I don't hammer on a lot of the things
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.500]   that a lot of people hammer on with finance.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.300]   And the reason why is because in my experience
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.500]   working as a financial planner, a lot of stuff just doesn't matter.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.900]   Again, the expense ratio on your mutual funds
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.600]   does not matter if you get divorced.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   I mean it does matter, but it's like in comparison
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.300]   to the cost of the divorce versus the other, it doesn't matter.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.400]   Now, can you enhance a good marriage
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.600]   and keep your mutual funds at a low expense ratio?
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.500]   A hundred percent you can, so that matters.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.400]   But let's start with the majors and focus on those
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.200]   instead of hammering on the minors.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.300]   That's my perspective.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.500]   Consider how can you invest now in your family and in your marriage?
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.400]   Because if you can keep your marriage together,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.700]   that will make a dramatic difference.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.500]   Don't make the mistake that so many have made
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.800]   of sacrificing their marriage on the altar of financial success
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.300]   and then destroying their altar of financial success
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.500]   because their marriage fell apart.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.700]   Don't make that mistake.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:34.200]   What can you do today to invest in your marriage?
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   It will be different for every one of us at different stages of our life.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.900]   It'll look different, it'll sound different,
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.700]   the answers will be different.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:55.500]   But that should be a question very high on our priority list.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   You know what? Investing in your marriage
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.200]   is probably one of the best things you could do
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   for your financial security.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.700]   Frankly, if you've got a good marriage,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.900]   your spouse will support you.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.900]   The wedding vows say in sickness and in health,
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.600]   in poverty and in riches.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   So if you're going through poverty,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   your spouse is there to support you.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.700]   If you're going through riches, your spouse is there for you.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.300]   If you get sick and you get disabled
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.900]   and you don't have disability insurance,
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.700]   if you've got a spouse, you've got a plan.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.100]   Now, it may not be an ideal plan.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.900]   I'd still love you to get some disability insurance,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.900]   but at least it's something.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.800]   I just want to encourage you with that.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.300]   What can you do to invest in marriage?
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.600]   And I hope, with this I'll close,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.300]   I hope it doesn't sound crass
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.900]   when I talk about examples like that.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.000]   I fear that it may sound a little crass
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.600]   to compare a spouse to an insurance policy.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.300]   I'm doing it intentionally just simply to drive home the point
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.300]   that there are financial ramifications to relationships.
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.400]   The reason that we buy life insurance on our spouse's life
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.800]   is because our spouse has a financial benefit to us.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.900]   That's why you can buy life insurance on a spouse's life,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.900]   because there is a financial benefit.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.200]   So let's recognize the financial benefit
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:20.900]   and let's expand our concept of finance and investing
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.400]   and let's include those things.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.700]   If you need to support your spouse
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.900]   and healthier eating habits,
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.400]   you might not need the insurance benefit
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.600]   because he or she died of a heart attack.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.900]   I think that's enough for today on this subject.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.900]   I just leave you with that.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.200]   What can you do to invest in your marriage
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.300]   and to really ensure that you not only have a marriage that lasts,
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.200]   but that you have a marriage that lasts,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.300]   that's filled with joy?
