[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180]   The word to which I should like to call your attention this evening, to be found in this
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.280]   book of the Acts of the Apostles, out of which we have read a portion at the beginning, but
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:22.360]   now in the seventh chapter, and reading verses 37 and 38.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.880]   Those who meet here regularly will know that we have been considering this statement now
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   for a number of weeks.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.480]   It is a part of an address that was delivered by a man called Stephen, who happens to have
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.600]   been the first Christian martyr.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.440]   He found himself standing before a great court in Jerusalem, the court which was called the
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.600]   Sanhedrin, and he was there on trial, and on trial for his life.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.480]   Why were they trying him?
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.840]   Well, they were trying him, really, because he was a Christian, a prominent Christian.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.720]   He had been made a deacon in the church, in the early church, and he had been given certain
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.960]   miraculous powers, and it was as a result of his teaching and preaching and his works
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.640]   that they had arrested him and had put him on trial.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.280]   The charge brought against him was this.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.600]   The sub and men which said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   and against God."
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.120]   Furthermore, they set up false witnesses which said, "This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.880]   words against this holy place, namely the temple and the law, for we have heard him
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.800]   say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   Moses delivered us."
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   Now, those are the charges that were brought against him.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   He's charged with being blasphemous, and the blasphemy was, as they thought, that he
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.000]   was speaking against Moses, speaking against the law that God had given to the Jews through
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.080]   Moses, speaking against the temple in which they worshipped God so regularly and in which
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.720]   they had worshipped him for so many centuries, and prior to that in the tabernacle in the
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   wilderness.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.040]   To them, this man was destroying all that, destroying the whole of their old religion,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.000]   the Jewish religion.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.240]   And so, they bring him before the court and they charge him in this way with blasphemy,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.080]   and they ask him to speak for himself.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.920]   The chief priest, high priest, looks at him and says, "Are these things so?"
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.240]   And Stephen makes his reply, and what we've got recorded in this long chapter is the essence
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.200]   of his speech on this occasion in defense not only of himself, but of the whole of the
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.440]   Christian message, the whole of the Christian faith.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.000]   And what he does, of course, is to review the history of the Jews as a nation.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.520]   They're very proud of this history.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.000]   The Jews were very proud of their national history, and particularly proud of certain
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.400]   people who figured prominently in that history.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.880]   And so Stephen takes up this very theme and picks out the men whom they revered above
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   all others.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.640]   He starts with Abraham, then he goes on to Joseph, and then he goes on to this case of
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.440]   Moses, which is, of course, in many ways the crucial case, because Moses having been the
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.760]   one through whom the law had come to them, they did give him a very special place as
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   the great lawgiver.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.240]   Moreover, he was the man who had led them out of the bondage of the captivity of Egypt
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.880]   and had brought them to the very verge of the promised land of Canaan.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.360]   So naturally Moses does occupy a very special place in their esteem.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.960]   Stephen therefore obviously has to take up this case, and he does so.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.400]   He's reviewed the birth, the early history of Moses, how God called him to deliver the
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   people and so on.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   Now having stated the facts, he here sums it all up.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.320]   And in effect what he's saying is this.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.480]   Now he said, "You revere the name of Moses, and you charge me with being against Moses
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.160]   and trying to undo the work of Moses."
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.080]   But what, after all, are the most important things about Moses?
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.000]   And in these two verses he tells us.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.160]   Moses was characterized especially by two things.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   It was through him that the word of God, what are called here the lively oracles, the living
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.480]   word of God, had come to the Jews.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.840]   That was the first thing.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.360]   The second thing was that Moses had prophesied very plainly and clearly the coming of the
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.600]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.760]   "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.520]   Him shall he hear."
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.820]   Now that according to Stephen is the essence of what Moses had done for these people.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.240]   And it really boils down to one thing.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.520]   It is this word of God.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.760]   Now what Stephen is really saying is this.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.560]   What made Abraham the man he was, was that he heard the word of God and recognized it.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.660]   He was a pagan living in Ur of the Chaldeans, as all other pagans.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.920]   And suddenly the word of God comes to him.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.720]   He recognized it and he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.640]   That's the secret of Abraham.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.480]   The same thing is true of Joseph.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.560]   All the story of this man is really understood in that one way.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.600]   That here was a man who was sensitive to the word of God.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.800]   And then he comes to the case of Moses.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.200]   And it's still the same.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.840]   This is the thing that makes him such an outstanding man.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.440]   He had glittering prospects in front of him.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.400]   He'd been brought up by Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.720]   She regarded him as her own son.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.280]   He had endless wonderful possibilities of worldly success.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.200]   He turned his back on it all.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   Why?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.120]   Well, he recognized the word of God.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.720]   He was always sensitive to this.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.480]   And he'd been in this unique position of being called up by God onto the top of that
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   mount to receive the word of God for the whole Jewish nation.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.080]   So what he's really saying to the members of the Sanhedrin is this.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:55.760]   All that you really are boasting in is the result of hearing the word of the Lord.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.520]   It is the word of the Lord that's made your nation as it has made all your great men.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   Why does he say this to them?
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.920]   Well his object, you see, is this.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   He's out to show them that their whole trouble at that moment was that they were insensitive
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.200]   to the word of God.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.160]   They failed to hear it.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.760]   They think they know it as regards the past, but they can't hear it in the present.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   And they are regarding the preaching of the Christian message as a contradiction of that
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   other word.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.120]   The whole object that Stephen has in his mind is to show that it's the same word, that it
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.040]   is a continuous word, and that any man or nation that is insensitive to the word of
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.920]   God fails.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.520]   On the other hand, the secret of success in this world is to hear and to recognize and
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:53.040]   give obedience to the living, lively, powerful word of God.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.480]   Now that's what he's doing.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.600]   And I, in my feeble manner, I'm trying to do the same thing.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.760]   Because it seems to me that the situation is still very similar to what it was at that
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.560]   particular point.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.720]   That's why our world is as it is, because it doesn't know the word of God.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.280]   Or to put it positively, the only hope for the world tonight is that it should hear this
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.960]   word of God.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   What is this word?
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.560]   This is the thing that runs through the whole of this book which we call the Bible.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.640]   We call this the word of God.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.920]   It is.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.680]   It's one great word, subdivided, if you like, into particular words for special occasions,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.040]   but it's one great word of God.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.480]   There's only one great message in the Bible.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   What is it?
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   Well, let me summarize it for you.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:54.040]   Here is the only book, the only word that tells us the truth about ourselves.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.760]   Nothing else tells us that.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.080]   Here's the only word that tells us the truth about man.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   Man's the problem.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.040]   And here is a word that tells us that man is not just some animal that's, some way or
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.720]   another, shuffled himself up out of some primitive slime.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   No, no, he's a being created in the image and likeness of God, and he's responsible
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.200]   to God, and he's meant to be Lord of creation, and he's meant to be upright and true and
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.280]   holy as God is.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   But he's false.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.320]   No, nothing else tells you this.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.920]   But this is the essence of this word of God, this lively, living oracle that you find right
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.240]   through this book.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:45.560]   And he tells us that here is man in his rebellion and sin and failure and consequent helplessness,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:52.200]   and that what he needs is to be delivered, that he can't deliver himself.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.480]   Now we've worked that out in detail.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:01.560]   The law that God gave to Moses, the Ten Commandments and the moral law, tell men how he ought to
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.600]   live, what he should be like.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.200]   But in telling him that, it tells him at the same time that he can't do it.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.960]   He's incapable of it.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.400]   He fails completely.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:17.000]   Indeed, it is implicit in the law to bring men to a realization of his utter and complete
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   helplessness.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.160]   Because let us not forget this.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.280]   A part of that law that God gave to Moses was all the instruction about building a tabernacle
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.960]   and about burnt offerings and sacrifices and so on.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960]   What's the teaching?
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.080]   Well, the teaching is this, that man can never deliver himself, that he's got to give an
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.800]   offering, he's got to bring a propitiation, and that the bringing of the blood of bulls
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.560]   and of goats is only temporary, and these are but prophecies of something greater, a
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.480]   deliverer that is yet to come.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.760]   In the whole of the law in the Old Testament, there is a pointing forward to the deliverer.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:04.920]   In other words, the great message of this word of God is this, that the only hope for
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:12.240]   the world lies in the fact that God, the maker of this world, the judge of the world, the
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.600]   one to whom we're all responsible, is concerned about this world still, that he hasn't abandoned
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.480]   it, he hasn't left it to himself.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   The world is not solely in the hands of the politicians and the philosophers.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.160]   That's why we are here tonight.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.440]   God is interested, and God has spoken.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   And what has he said?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:40.800]   Well, he has said that he has a plan and a great scheme for the salvation of men and
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.640]   for the restoration of the whole universe to its original condition of perfection.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   That is the great message and theme of the Bible from beginning to end, that God is interested
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.680]   and God is concerned.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.000]   Now, this is a great message.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.240]   It tells us that there are three persons in the garden.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:15.600]   And so far we've been considering God the Father, God the Creator.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   There it is in the first verse in the book of Genesis.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.880]   God the lawgiver, the God who gave the law to Moses on Sinai.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.240]   This is God the Father.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.920]   He is the one who planned salvation.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:36.380]   Even before the foundation of the world, he evolved this amazing scheme and plan of salvation.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.920]   We must be clear about this.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.480]   The apostles were constantly preaching this.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.640]   Did you notice even in that sermon of Peter's on the day of Pentecost, which I read to you
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.800]   at the beginning in the second chapter, Peter refers to our Lord's death upon the cross
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   in these terms, him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.680]   The cross of Calvary is not the mere action of men, they are the mere passive ignorant
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   instruments.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:11.960]   It's God, predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   That's the message.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.040]   And you see, this is how the Bible tells us, this great word that is in the Bible tells
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.680]   us that the three persons in the blessed holy trinity are interested in our salvation and
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680]   deliverance.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.300]   That's what makes it such an amazing and wonderful privilege to be a preacher of such
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.320]   a gospel to a world such as this tonight.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.440]   To say that the three persons in the blessed holy trinity are interested, are concerned,
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.760]   and have planned before the foundation of the very universe the way of man's deliverance,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.320]   the Father's idea.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:54.120]   The Son came to put it into operation and into practice.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.000]   We've seen how he was prophesied and predicted in the Old Testament in the types and the
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.360]   shadows and the adumbrations, and how when the fullness of the times was come, he appeared
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.360]   and did his work.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.880]   "A prophet from the Lord your God, raised up unto you of your brethren, like unto me,
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.680]   a man like Moses, but more than a man.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:24.200]   God the Son, God and man, in the full plenitude of his divine saviourhood."
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.560]   Now, that is the point at which we've arrived, but you see it doesn't stop there.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   This message tells us that God the Holy Spirit is also concerned and is involved in this
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.080]   great plan of salvation.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   What is his part?
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:48.120]   Well, a simple way of looking at it is this, that the Father planned it, the Son came to
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   do the work that was absolutely essential to its being carried out, and the Holy Spirit
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:02.920]   applies it to us, he brings it to us, he mediates it to us, he puts it into execution in our
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   life.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.320]   Now we're meeting together on Whitsunday.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.800]   What has that got to do with us, Sir Simon?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.200]   What's Whitsunday got to do with me?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.600]   Well I want to show you what it's got to do with you.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.400]   It's a part of this Word.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.760]   It's a very vital part of this Word.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.880]   It is a vital part of this whole business of salvation, which God planned before time
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.520]   for you and for me.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.320]   All this is tremendously relevant.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.800]   Now then the Holy Spirit, you see, he does this by bringing it to us, he works in our
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.960]   minds, he works in our hearts, and he brings the knowledge and the power of this great
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.200]   salvation unto us.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   Now this was the very thing, you see, that Stephen in a different way was saying to the
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.560]   members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.040]   Why is Stephen there being charged with blasphemy?
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.680]   Why had all the apostles been arrested already more than once and put on trial?
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.200]   What's the matter?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.820]   What is this?
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.440]   What is this new phenomenon?
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.240]   You see the Sanhedrin is puzzled.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.160]   They don't understand this.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.120]   For after all, these apostles and others are ordinary men, where they've already been
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.000]   described in chapter 4 as ignorant and unlearned men.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.200]   They were not a collection of philosophers from Greece.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.920]   They were not a collection of experts.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.200]   They were not Romans, experts in law.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.040]   No, no, they were ordinary fishermen.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.320]   They were men who hadn't passed through any schools, they had no background, they had
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.360]   no culture, they had nothing.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.280]   Except this, it was noted that they'd been with that Jesus.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   And it was further known that something amazing and extraordinary had happened to them on
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.400]   that day of Pentecost.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.560]   From that moment, they'd become transfigured.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.760]   Before that, they were obviously very ignorant men.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.040]   They'd been given some remarkable powers, but when their lord and master and leader
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.720]   was crucified, they all lost hope.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.840]   They nearly gave up.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.360]   Some of them disappeared like Thomas and only came back later.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.160]   And they were in utter confusion, but suddenly they were all changed.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.120]   And on this day of Pentecost, an amazing power had come upon them.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   They were able to speak with power and authority and understanding.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.520]   They were able to speak in other languages.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   They were able to work miracles.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   What is this?
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.160]   That's the problem confronting the Sanhedrin.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.400]   But to them it was blasphemy.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600]   To them it is something that is to be stopped.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.400]   It is something that is harmful to the people.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.460]   So they arrest the apostles and here they're arresting this man Stephen and are putting
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   him on trial.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.240]   And he, in his reply, is really saying this to them.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.040]   He says, "You know what's happened?
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.120]   You knew what happened to Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.160]   He lived amongst you for three years.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   You heard him preaching.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   You saw his miracles.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.800]   You know what's happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.280]   You've heard what's happened since.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:16.720]   And though you've seen and have known these things, you still regard it as blasphemy.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.520]   And you say it is against all that was taught us by Moses, all that has been taught us by
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   the temple and its ceremonial.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.760]   Oh, you're blind, says Stephen.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.360]   You can't see, says Stephen, that all this which has happened before your very eyes is
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.560]   nothing but the fulfillment of what was prophesied.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.480]   It is the fulfillment of what Moses taught and what all the prophets have taught since
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.680]   Moses, what the law has been teaching from the very beginning.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.040]   Now that is what he's saying.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.200]   And that is what I want to put to you in terms of what happened on the day of Pentecost and
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.760]   the significance, therefore, of which Sunday.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.800]   Moses had prophesied all this.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.040]   See that's their blunder.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.960]   They think it's against Moses.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.600]   But this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, "A prophet shall the Lord
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   your God raise up unto you and your brethren like unto me.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.040]   Him shall he hear."
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.080]   This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the Mount
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:30.040]   Sinai and with our fathers who received the living oracles that give unto us.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   Look at it like this.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.600]   Moses had prophesied everything that they'd witnessed.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.680]   This is not against Moses, it is the fulfillment of what Moses had anticipated and had prophesied.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.520]   Now, but here's the question.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.840]   What was it that had enabled Moses to say, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.320]   up unto you of your brethren like unto me"?
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.640]   What had enabled Moses to say that?
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.240]   Now this is the important question.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.520]   Here is a direct statement made by Moses.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:12.360]   He prophesied the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, what he was going to say, what he
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.000]   was going to do, and remember that includes his teaching about his sending the Holy Spirit
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.880]   upon the church on the day of Pentecost.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.280]   Moses has anticipated this, that this is the one who really is going to be the messenger
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.680]   of salvation.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.040]   What had enabled Moses to do that?
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.600]   Here's the question.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   And there is only one answer to the question.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.600]   It was the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit upon Moses.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.400]   Moses, let us never forget, lived some fourteen hundred years before the birth of Jesus of
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.040]   Nazareth in Bethlehem.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.320]   Fourteen hundred years.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.560]   Yet he prophesied the coming of this Jesus.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.480]   It's not only true of Moses, it is true of all the other prophets.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   This is the most important matter.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.600]   This isn't something academic.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.560]   I'm going to show you its relevance, its practical relevance to every one of us in
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.720]   this chapel at this moment.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:25.520]   Not only Moses, but these other prophets whose works are recorded in the Old Testament in
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.320]   various ways.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.640]   They prophesied not only the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, but also that he would
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.440]   be the one who was going to send and baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.520]   How did they do this?
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.460]   They give details.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.440]   They tell us where he's to be born.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.360]   They tell us how he's going to die.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.440]   Now this is sheer fact.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.760]   You can read it for yourselves.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.320]   There it is.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.640]   Eight centuries and sometimes more.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   David, ten centuries.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.360]   A thousand years before the birth of Christ.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.280]   You remember how Peter quoted him in his sermon on the day of Pentecost.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.880]   Quotes Joel, quotes David and others.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.320]   Now here is the question.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.840]   How were these men able to do this?
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.560]   They did it.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.320]   And so the whole of the Jewish nation was not only looking forward to the coming of
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   the Messiah.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.720]   It was looking forward to what it called the promise of the Father.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.880]   And the promise of the Father is the descent of the Holy Ghost.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.600]   The coming of this divine power upon men so that servants and handmaidens will be able
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   to prophesy.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.360]   Old men will dream dreams of mighty transforming power that's going to change everything.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.080]   The promise of the Father.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.840]   How had they been able to do this?
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.600]   And you see there's only one answer to the question.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.960]   It is the answer given by Peter in his second epistle.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   He puts it like this.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:00.080]   He is writing just before his death to the churches and the Christian people with whom
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.840]   he was familiar and he knows that for various reasons they were rather dejected at the time.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.880]   But he tells them, he says, listen to me, he says, we have not followed cunningly devised
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.760]   fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.840]   But were I witnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.320]   When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, this is my beloved son in
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.040]   whom I am well pleased.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:39.520]   And this voice which came from him we heard when we were with him in the holy mount.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.200]   Hold on to that says Peter.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.840]   I'm going to die.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   Hold on to this.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   We are witnesses.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:51.360]   James and Peter and I, James and John and I were with him on the holy mount of transfiguration.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   We heard the voice.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.780]   Hold on to that.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.320]   But he says not only that.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.920]   We have also a more sure word of prophecy.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   A word of prophecy substantiated, proved.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.360]   Where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.360]   until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   Explain this first.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.920]   What do they know?
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:23.400]   Well, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.760]   A prophecy such as you have in the old testament is not the result of some foresighted man,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.240]   some unusually intelligent being who can see a little bit further than somebody else.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.920]   That's not the explanation.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.160]   It's not something excogitated from the mind of men.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.040]   It isn't some second sight.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040]   It's impossible.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.640]   There's only one answer.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.720]   No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.360]   For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of men.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:03.040]   But holy men of God speak as they were moved by the holy ghost, as they were influenced,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:09.080]   controlled, carried along, borne along by the holy spirit of God.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.200]   Now this is of the first significance for us all.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.520]   It means this, you see.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.120]   It was the holy spirit alone, the third person in the blessed holy trinity, who could make
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.640]   known this truth to men so many centuries ahead of the time.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.600]   He made it known to them.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   He made it known to Moses.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.480]   He made it known to this great succession of prophets.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.800]   They couldn't imagine this.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.560]   They all say the same thing.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.560]   It's given to them.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.240]   They say the burden of the law, the message of the Lord.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.320]   They'd go into some almost ecstatic condition.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.040]   The afflators would come upon them and they'd have clarity of understanding.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.160]   The truth would be opened out before them and they'd be controlled in their recording
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   of it.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:26:01.760]   Now this is important in this way, that here is an absolute proof to us of the reality
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.160]   of the spiritual realm.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.360]   There is no greater proof than this.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:19.640]   It proves the reality of God, the reality of the unseen realm, the truth, the reliability
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   of the Bible.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.240]   It's a word of prophecy made yet more sure.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.360]   And so you see, as you live in this world tonight and you say, "What can we do?
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.920]   Is there anything beyond men?"
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.400]   I say, "Listen to this word of God.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.320]   Here is a word that can speak of something to happen centuries ahead.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.800]   A thousand years, fourteen hundred years.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.360]   God has revealed it.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.040]   There is no other explanation."
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.960]   That is a part of the significance of this day of Pentecost.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:55.920]   This Holy Spirit had been acting upon men even before the birth of the Son of God.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:04.120]   But you see, these things, and this day of Pentecost in particular, had been anticipated
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:12.760]   not only in the words of Moses and in the words of the prophets, all this had been anticipated
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.800]   also in the very teaching of the Lord.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.760]   Now if you would like to go back and read the books of Exodus and Leviticus and parts
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:27.240]   of Numbers, you'll find that there are great instructions given there, not only about burnt
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:34.560]   offerings and sacrifices, but also of certain feasts that were to be held.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.800]   And amongst them was the feast which was called the Feast of Pentecost.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.960]   You remember how in the second chapter of Acts I read out to you, at least I didn't
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.120]   tonight perhaps, but I did this morning, you will find there in the early part of that
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.800]   chapter a statement that at Jerusalem at that time there were men and women who had gathered
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.520]   together from the various parts of the then civilized world.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.520]   Listen.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:06.680]   We are told now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.160]   And they were all in difficulty for this reason.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.640]   How here we every men in our own tongue were in we were born speaking these things.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   Who were they?
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.880]   Parthians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and so on.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.480]   We are told they were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men out of every nation under
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   heaven.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   What were they doing there?
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.920]   Well, they had gone up because it was this great feast of Pentecost.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.680]   It had been given to them through Moses and they had observed it annually ever since.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.120]   There were a number of feasts, you can read them for yourselves.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.240]   But what's interesting for us is this.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.080]   There was an occasion when they celebrated the Passover.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.400]   How the children of Israel had escaped from Egypt through painting blood upon the door
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.040]   posts and the lintel of their doors.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.840]   And there was a feast in connection with what we now call Easter.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.560]   Then the instructions say this, that after the passing of seven Sundays, at least on
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.840]   the seventh Sunday from Easter, they were to observe this feast of Pentecost.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:26.200]   When they were to offer to God two baked loaves, at Easter they were to offer sheaves, but
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:35.080]   now they're to offer two baked loaves on this particular feast of Pentecost.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.600]   What's the meaning of Pentecost?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.920]   This feast that brought these people together to Jerusalem on this momentous occasion when
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.120]   the Holy Spirit came down upon the church and these astounding things began to happen.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:57.360]   Well, you see, the whole object of that feast was to prophesy the coming of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.640]   The exact timing is again a most amazing and extraordinary thing.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:10.800]   There, 1400 years before, they were told this, that on the seventh Sabbath after the rising
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:17.720]   of the Messiah, the Holy Ghost was going to come down and that very thing happened.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.080]   That's why we observe which Sunday.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:28.480]   Not only did Moses prophesy it in words, it was prophesied by the very feasts and the
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.180]   ritual and the ceremonial of the temple.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.360]   Another interesting way in which it happened was this, in the use of oil.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.800]   Oil in the Old Testament generally represents the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.360]   So here you have in this old book, the Old Testament, a prophecy, not only of the coming
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.440]   of the Son of God, but the sending of the Holy Ghost.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:56.200]   Then you start your New Testament, what you find John the Baptist, he was the first preacher,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.560]   and he was a remarkable man.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.560]   He was a strange man.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.400]   He dressed in an odd manner, he didn't live in the towns, he lived in the wilderness,
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.200]   and he began to speak and people rushed out to listen to him.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.040]   He was an extraordinary man and they said, "This must be this Messiah.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.000]   He is the one we've been expecting.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   This is the prophet."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.520]   "Now now," says John, "I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh,
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.840]   the lecher to whose shoes I am unworthy to unloose.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.040]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in his hand and he
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into his garner, but the chaff he
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.960]   will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.120]   John prophesied the coming of Pentecost.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   And our Lord did exactly the same thing.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.360]   He said that this was going to happen and that they would see wonders and signs and
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.600]   miracles and extraordinary things.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.160]   Now the significance of this for you and for me can be put in this form.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.040]   Here is one called Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.360]   He's only a carpenter.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:11.280]   He has not been trained in the schools, but he makes extraordinary claims.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.520]   He looks at people and says, "Follow me," expecting them to do so.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.520]   He says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.720]   He tells them he's going to die and rise again.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.960]   He says that after he's gone, he's going to send the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.200]   Now he's committed himself to these specific things.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.120]   People you see don't pay attention to this.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.400]   They read the sermon on the mount and they're interested in the ethics and the morals, but
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   my dear friends, these are the things that really matter.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:46.800]   He has committed himself specifically to this thing about sending the Holy Spirit upon his
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   people.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:55.600]   "Carry," he says, "in Jerusalem until you have received power from on high.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.760]   You're going to receive it, and then and then only you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.520]   and Samaria and unto the outermost parts of the earth."
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.640]   Now the day of Pentecost came.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   What's its meaning?
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.640]   What's its significance?
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.520]   It is this.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.880]   It attests our Lord's person.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.080]   It shows us that he is what he claims to be the Son of God.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.040]   You see the prophets have been given this knowledge by the Holy Spirit, and he is filled
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.040]   with the Spirit.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.600]   "God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him."
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.960]   He is filled with the Spirit, and in this wholeness of the Spirit, he prophesies that
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.920]   he's going to send forth the Spirit, and he does.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:49.960]   And the doing of that on the day of Pentecost establishes finally the fact that Jesus of
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:57.600]   Nazareth is the Son of God, the fulfillment of all the word that was given through Moses
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.640]   and all the prophets.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:06.840]   Pentecost is the final proof of that, and that is the significance of this particular
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   day.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:15.520]   And so we are reminded that one of the great works of the Spirit is to give absolute proof
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.640]   that this is the word of God, and that God is fulfilling his plan and his promise to
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.760]   save mankind through a series of saving actions.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:34.000]   And this is the last of those great actions.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.880]   But you see the Spirit also has another function to serve, and this is equally important for
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.880]   us.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:49.600]   Let us never forget, I say, that the day of Pentecost is absolutely vital to prove the
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.280]   authority of the whole of the word of God, the Scriptures.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   But he does it yet in another way, and that is in this work that he does in us and upon
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.200]   us in a direct manner.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:13.360]   Our Lord himself in promising the Spirit had said this, "He shall convince the world
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:20.640]   of sin and of righteousness and of judgment."
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640]   And he does that.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.240]   He began to do so immediately.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   How does he do it?
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.520]   Well, look again at that record which you've got there in the second chapter of the book
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:37.000]   of the Acts of the Apostles, and you'll see the whole thing as it were in a nutshell.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.880]   He shall convince the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.280]   Moses had seen all this.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:52.560]   He knows the law can do this, but he also knows that the law can be a dead letter.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.840]   The letter killeth.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.200]   It is the Spirit that giveth life.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.280]   And so he knew that the real work of conviction was going to be done when the Holy Spirit
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.340]   had come in his fullness.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:13.680]   And you notice there on the day of Pentecost that Peter gets up and preaches his sermon,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:19.840]   which seems to be an exposition of Scripture and an explanation of certain old prophecies
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.720]   and extraordinary things happen as he's preaching.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.840]   Suddenly these people are pricked in their hearts and they cry out saying, "Men and
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.120]   brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.120]   What is this?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.000]   My dear friends, this is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   This is the Holy Spirit convicting of sin and of righteousness and of judgment to come.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   What does he do?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.160]   Well, the first thing he does, of course, is to convince us all of our ignorance.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.320]   Look at this crowd at Jerusalem that was listening to Peter.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.840]   You know the sort of crowd it was.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.160]   It was the same crowd that a few weeks before had been shouting out at the top of its voice,
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.080]   "Away with him, crucify him."
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.640]   The fickle crowd.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.600]   Following Jesus one day and acclaiming him, then listening to their leaders, the Pharisees
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:21.360]   and Sadducees and Scribes, and turning right round and saying, "Give us Barabbas.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.320]   Away with him, crucify him."
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.920]   There they are, and now they're confronted by this phenomenon of these extraordinary
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.040]   simple men who are speaking with power and authority and in strange languages.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   What is this?
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:41.080]   And they go out of curiosity to listen to what this strange preacher has got to say.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:48.840]   But as they listen, they suddenly become convicted and they're convicted of their ignorance.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   What ignorance?
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:56.560]   Well, you see, this is what the Holy Spirit does, and he's still doing it.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.620]   He opens our eyes to the realization of the fact that we've lived in utter unawareness
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.960]   of the fact that we possess a soul.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.360]   How often does man think about his soul?
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.600]   Oh, I know he thinks about his pleasures, he thinks about his work, he thinks about
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:20.200]   his birth, marriage, death, money, bank balance, gambling, all the things that the modern world
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.920]   is doing, politics, and he gets excited and he'll march and make his protest.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.760]   Does he think about his soul?
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.400]   How often does man by nature realize that he's got a soul?
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.600]   You see, what the Holy Spirit does is to bring this word to us and it always comes as light
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.520]   and as teaching, and it enables a man to see for the first time that he's got a soul within
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.920]   him, that he's not a money-making machine or a pleasure machine.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.640]   Now, he's a soul, a living soul.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.800]   He's been unaware of this, and he's been unaware of God.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.880]   He's been so interested in himself and men that he hasn't thought about God.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.760]   He may have said, like the fool, "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.960]   And now he's awakened to the appalling ignorance.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.520]   Prophecy proves there must be, and other things demonstrate the same thing.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520]   But he's been unaware of this.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.520]   The Spirit awakens him to see his own ignorance.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:24.200]   He finds that he's been entirely unaware of the whole object and purpose of life in this
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.240]   world.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:35.520]   He just thinks that he'll come into it as the result of some blind evolutionary process,
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.960]   some impersonal forces produce us, and that we are here to have as good a time as we can,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.880]   and then we die, and that's the end of it.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.640]   But now the Spirit awakens him to the realization that there isn't life, that man's not an animal,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.000]   and that dust of our cadustre turnest was not spoken of the soul.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.160]   It awakens man to the realization that he's immortal, and that there stretches before
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.320]   him immortality, everlasting condition.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.840]   He's unaware of this.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   Are you aware of it, my friends?
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.680]   Have these things been active to your consciousness?
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.480]   It is the Spirit of God alone that brings these things to us.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.920]   As he convicted those people in Jerusalem, faultless mob, listening out of curiosity,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.200]   suddenly they're aware that this is concerning them.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.640]   They'd cried away with him.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   What were they doing?
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   They didn't know.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   It was ignorance.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:32.160]   Yes, not only ignorance of themselves and their soul, and the meaning of life and God,
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.760]   but utter ignorance of God's plan.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:42.040]   Getting so excited about elections, local and general, getting excited about men and
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.720]   politicians, and never giving a thought to God's plan for this world in its appalling
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.640]   mess and misery and shame and sorrow and degradation.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:58.520]   Here is the ignorance, not knowing about this and dismissing it even when they hear it.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:05.120]   Not of the person of the Lord, saying of him, "Who is this fellow, this carpenter of Nazareth?"
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   Shunting to get rid of him, preferring a robber.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.120]   Blindness.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.360]   "Many brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   They say.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.440]   They're convicted of their ignorance.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.520]   But you know the Holy Spirit doesn't stop at convicting us of our ignorance.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.320]   He convicts us also of our utter inability.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.480]   And this is much more serious.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:34.680]   Man is proud of himself, proud of his understanding, proud of his brains, proud of his knowledge,
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   proud of his learning.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.400]   Do you know what the Holy Spirit does?
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.440]   He shows you that all you're proud of is useless, valueless.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   How?
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.160]   Well, like this.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.560]   That man, with all his supposed genius and ability, can never find out the things that
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.560]   rarely matter.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.120]   Can a man, by searching, find out God?
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.400]   There's only one answer.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   He cannot.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.320]   Paul puts it to the clever Corinthians who were so proud of their philosophers.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.240]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:17.120]   But man will persist in thinking he can find God until the Spirit has convicted him of
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.080]   the fact that he never can.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.400]   That is impossible.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:29.120]   Indeed, the Spirit convicts us of something even worse than that.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:39.960]   And that is this, that even when we are confronted by truth incarnate, we cannot recognize it.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.440]   This is a devastating thing.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.360]   This is where the Spirit of God really shows us to ourselves as we are.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.320]   Man, by searching, not only cannot find God.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.200]   But he's always as foolish as this, that when God stands before him, he doesn't recognize
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   him.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.280]   Now listen to Paul putting this.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.480]   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:10.040]   the world and to our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:17.680]   For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.520]   Now that is simple fact.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:27.800]   The world is so lost, it's so helpless, it's so damned, that when God the incarnate stood
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.320]   before it, it didn't recognize him.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.680]   It said, "Away with him!"
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.160]   The members of the Sanhedrin are blind in this sense.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.680]   That's what Stephen's saying to them.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.160]   He said, "Moses, the man you revere, prophesied the coming of this one.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.760]   You've seen him, you've heard him, you've seen his miracles, but you haven't recognized
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   him.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.640]   Why, you're blind!"
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:53.280]   The spirit alone can open our eyes to see that and to show us in consequence the terrible
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.880]   danger in which we are.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.440]   But listen to Paul putting it again.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   Listen to this.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:04.680]   "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   unto him.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:12.880]   Neither can he know them, for they are spiritually disowned."
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.320]   This is the terrible thing.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.520]   Listen, says Stephen, to the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.640]   You are aware of these facts.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.960]   You've seen Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.520]   You've heard his messages.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   You've seen his miracles.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.800]   You know what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.000]   These things have happened before your eyes, and yet you don't believe them.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Why not?
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Because you're spiritually dead.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   You're blind.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   You can't see.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:49.360]   "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.360]   unto him.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:56.440]   Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually disowned."
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.320]   This is the whole tragedy of our modern world.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   We are trusting the men.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.320]   We are trusting the cleverness.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.320]   We are trusting the ability.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.320]   We are trusting the knowledge.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   We are trusting the science.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   As if these can find it.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   They cannot.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   Blind.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:16.500]   But the Spirit alone can bring conviction concerning these things and show us the consequent
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.540]   danger in which we are.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:24.880]   But thank God the Spirit doesn't stop his work at that negative action of conviction
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.880]   of sin.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:34.120]   It is he who brings us the revelation of this great and glorious salvation.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:40.200]   The Lord had said, "When promising the Spirit, he shall glorify me."
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.440]   And you notice what Peter did on the day of Pentecost when he was filled with the Spirit.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:51.640]   He preached about Christ, this blessed person, the one whom they had rejected.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.480]   He's son of God, the one David had looked forward to.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.640]   The Lord said unto my Lord, "Sit on my right hand.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.920]   Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, or suffer thine holy one to see corruption."
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.960]   That couldn't have been spoken about David himself, says Peter in his sermon, because
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.800]   David's sepulcher is still here and his bones are there.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.920]   But this one, he was looking forward.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.680]   The Spirit had enabled him to do that.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.880]   And the Spirit still does that.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:26.760]   It is the business and the work of the Holy Spirit to unfold to us that God was in Christ
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.320]   reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.120]   Man doesn't see this.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.720]   He is convicted first.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.880]   Then the Spirit shows him that God has provided a lamb.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.320]   "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world," says John the Baptist.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.880]   Our Lord said, "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.920]   to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:59.360]   "Yes," says Peter, "who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:06.440]   we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed."
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.840]   This is the Spirit's work.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.240]   He alone can enable us to see this.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.920]   It's foolishness to everybody else, but the Spirit can give us this understanding.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.960]   And that is again what Paul was saying in that second chapter of his first epistle to
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960]   the Corinthians.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:27.160]   "None of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.440]   crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:35.960]   But as it is written, 'I have not seen nor heard, neither have entered into the heart
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:43.120]   of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.800]   them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:51.960]   For the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.360]   We have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:05.840]   That we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   The apostle preaches and they cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.200]   And Peter answers them, "Repent," he says, "and be baptized, every one of you, in the
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.880]   name of Jesus, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   Ghost."
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:28.480]   And what we are told is this, "Then they that gladly received his word were baptized,
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:35.880]   and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls."
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.040]   This is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.400]   He breaks the heart.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.200]   He reveals to us our ignorance.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.760]   He reveals our sinfulness to us.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.880]   He makes us see that the problem for us is not what they may be doing in South Africa,
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.720]   or what is happening in Vietnam, and all these political, social questions.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.480]   I'm not saying they're not important, but they're not your primary problems and mine.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.760]   Here's your primary problem and mine.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.480]   What am I?
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   What is man?
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.400]   How am I going to die, for I've got to die?
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.320]   Whatever I do, I've got to die.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.520]   And if a man dies, shall he live again?
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.800]   What happens after death?
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.960]   Now these are the questions that nobody can answer but this word of God, and the Spirit
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.280]   brings it home to us.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.840]   And when he does, we are pricked in the heart.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   We say, "Where are we?
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.840]   What have we been doing?
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.840]   We haven't thought of these things.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   I've got a soul.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.840]   What's going to happen?
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   I'm lost.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.840]   I'm a sinner.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.840]   I don't know God.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.120]   I can't get rid of my sins.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.200]   I can't find God, and yet I need him.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   I must be blessed with him.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   What can I do?"
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:53.920]   But then the Spirit reveals the blessed fact that God so loved the world that he gave his
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:00.880]   only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   life.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.840]   Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.840]   That's it.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:13.280]   It's this wonderful, amazing message that though you and I cannot save ourselves, God
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   has so loved us.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   I don't understand it.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.400]   I don't deserve it, but he's done it.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.720]   He sent his only Son into the world and has put my sins on him and has punished him for
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.600]   me and offers me free pardon and forgiveness.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.000]   That's the message.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.960]   And my dear friends, the question I leave with you on this Sunday, this anniversary
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.560]   of the first day of Pentecost, is just this.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.240]   What does all this mean to you?
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.920]   It was blasphemy to the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   This astounding thing.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:57.520]   All that had happened in Jesus of Nazareth, his coming, his living, his doing good, his
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:04.600]   miracles, his sacrificial death, his burial, his resurrection, his appearance, his ascension,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:09.640]   the descent of the Holy Ghost, the change in these men, the miracles that they'd been
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:15.200]   working, the miracle of the laymen at the beautiful gate of the temple and many others,
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.600]   it all meant nothing but blasphemy.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   What's the matter with them?
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.240]   Blinded by tradition, proud of their position.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.480]   Is that your position?
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.760]   Is this foolishness unto you?
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:37.960]   Is this some old story, some fairy tale?
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:44.160]   Something unworthy of the modern, sophisticated, scientific men in the mid-twentieth century.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.160]   Is that it?
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:55.240]   Well, I'm just here to remind you that the fact of Pentecost is a condemnation of your
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   whole position.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.320]   Moses had prophesied it.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.400]   He could only do so through the operation of the Spirit of God upon him.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.560]   All the other prophets the same.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.240]   Can't you see the facts?
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.920]   The day of Pentecost is a fact.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.880]   What happened in Jerusalem did happen literally.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.880]   It is through history.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.360]   There wouldn't be a church but for that.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.880]   These men were cast down, they were mourning, they were miserable, they were unhappy.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.600]   Suddenly they transfigured, speak with authority and power, work miracles, the church goes
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   on.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   What is it?
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   Oh, it's the Holy Ghost.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:45.360]   Can't you see, my dear friend, the relevance of all this to you?
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:51.040]   This is the thing, you see, that Stephen finally brings home to the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.120]   The 51st verse of this seventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles reads
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   like this.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:09.960]   "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost,
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:17.520]   even as your fathers did, so do ye."
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.880]   Have these things touched you?
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.600]   Have these things moved you?
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.200]   Have these things shaken you?
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.160]   Have they revealed to you your ignorance about your soul and your eternal destiny, your ignorance
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.680]   of these mighty events and their significance?
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.400]   Have you seen it?
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.240]   Very well.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.920]   The question is this.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.600]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.000]   Do you resent it?
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.120]   Do you resist it?
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.440]   Are you battling for all you're worth with your mind and everything else you've got
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.720]   against it?
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:57.880]   Oh, my dear friend, learn the lesson of these foolish members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:06.240]   Blinded by prejudice to the facts, and beware lest you be blinded by the same kind of prejudice
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:13.960]   of this twentieth century, the foolish prejudice based upon supposed knowledge and discovery
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:22.640]   and ability and advance, beware lest you be blinded by the same prejudice and resist the
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:31.040]   Holy Ghost, even as they did, and even as the children of Israel had so frequently done
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:37.080]   in their long story as recorded in the Old Testament Scriptures.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:43.320]   My dear friend, here is the most important question that you'll ever face.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.000]   What think ye of Christ?
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.680]   Do you know that God has sent his only Son into this world, not only to live and teach,
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:59.440]   but to die and to rise again?
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:06.360]   In order that you might be saved, that your sins might be forgiven, that you might become
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:13.440]   a son of God, receive a new heart and a new nature, begin to live a new life, and have
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:22.160]   a right to look forward to the glories of eternity in the presence of God.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:34.400]   Oh, may God forbid that anyone should resist the Holy Spirit of God and go to perdition.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.960]   Amen.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
