[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.360]   This episode was jointly hosted
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.280]   by the Pre and Early Retirement
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.200]   and Retired Life Stage Chapters
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.440]   and recorded November 10th, 2021.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.880]   It features Jill Steinberg, PhD,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.840]   a licensed clinical psychologist
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.500]   and emeritus professor at San Jose State University.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.120]   Her topic is titled Successful Retirement
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.160]   or Retiring or Rewiring
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.780]   and addresses non-financial aspects of retirement.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.800]   Bogleheads are investors
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.120]   who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.560]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.000]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.060]   and should not be construed
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.880]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.640]   It is my pleasure to introduce tonight's speaker,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.040]   Jill Steinberg, PhD.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.960]   Jill's an emeritus professor at San Jose State University
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.480]   and a licensed clinical psychologist.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.800]   She has published research, taught classes
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.320]   and given presentations on successful retirement
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.360]   to universities and professional organizations.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160]   Our interviewer tonight is Gauri,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.460]   who is one of the co-coordinators
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.160]   of the Bogleheads Starting Out Life Stage Chapter
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.220]   and also the coordinator
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280]   of the New York City Bogleheads Chapter.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.820]   Okay, there we go.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.100]   Okay, we're already recording, right?
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.900]   So Gauri, I think we're ready to turn it over to you.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.340]   - Fantastic, thanks so much, Carol.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.820]   And thanks to the broader team for helping set this up.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.780]   It's really phenomenal how the Bogleheads community
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.780]   helps so many others in the community and within itself.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.900]   And that's a great segue to have Jill here.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.540]   It's such an honor and privilege.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.540]   Your work is so, I think, beyond the normal Boglehead theme.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.180]   That I think this audience will get a lot out
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.660]   of what you're about to cover.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.820]   So, so many questions were submitted via the RSVPs.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.760]   So I'm gonna start, as Carol mentioned,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.700]   with how they were chosen.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.180]   The first question is, I'm 10 months retired
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.980]   and doing what I've always wanted, which is reading more
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.060]   and spending all my time with my wonderful wife.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.420]   We're introverts and don't get out much.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.860]   Should I expect to need a purpose at some point?
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.580]   And the purpose is in quotes.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.060]   - Okay, so if you'll let me, Gauri,
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.900]   I'd like to just answer this first question
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.340]   a little bit longer, so the audience can get an idea
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.540]   of the kind of information I know
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.600]   and how I think about a question.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.700]   And I'm gonna, you'll see, I don't give advice.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   I give the research information that addresses the question
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.900]   so that the person can be as informed as they can be
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.420]   in thinking it through decisions they wanna make.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.820]   And because I don't know any of you.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.420]   If I knew you and knew you well,
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.700]   then I feel like I could tailor my information more to you.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.580]   So maybe that'll happen later.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.720]   But for right now, let me address it.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   So it sounds like not a very complicated question.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   It was very clear and thoughtful to the point,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.200]   and it's actually very complicated.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.560]   So I'm gonna tell you some of the dimensions
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.640]   that I look at when I think about it.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   So the person's been retired and happily at home, reading.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.160]   Will they need a purpose?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.440]   First of all, let me congratulate them.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.280]   The fact that they're home and they have a partner
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.480]   that they like being with, that's remarkable.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.680]   And if you look at the literature,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.080]   there's the longest term study on happiness
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.220]   is the Harvard study.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.160]   The thing that came out there, so it's over 80 years now,
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.480]   they've been following people
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.060]   and eventually they followed the wives.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.200]   At first they didn't,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.560]   and they were following heterosexual people
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.240]   or that's how they identified.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.640]   Anyway, having a partner that you feel good about.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.160]   They use marriage, I use partner because that's too limited.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   Anyway, having a life partner that you feel good about
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.760]   is one of the best predictors of happiness.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.400]   So congratulations on that,
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.880]   and congratulations that you created the money
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.440]   that you can have this experience or the resources.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   It is a privilege and amazing that some of us can do that.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.560]   So in terms of purpose,
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.520]   what I wanna say to you is
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.840]   there is a huge literature on the importance of purpose
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.360]   in someone's life in terms of their mental health,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.920]   their physical health.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.360]   The literature says you can predict better
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.240]   about how happy or how healthy a person's gonna be
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   using purpose more than if they're abusing alcohol,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.560]   if they're abusing cigarettes, how stressed they are.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.400]   That's how important it is.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.520]   It's a huge literature.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.960]   So given I don't know you,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.600]   for all I know you're living your purpose,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.120]   reading, learning, being with your wife
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.840]   might be how you identify purpose.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   It can come in many forms.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I'm gonna just tell you a couple other things
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   that come up in my mind.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.920]   So there's a huge literature throughout life
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.380]   about social connection.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.380]   So you have your partner and you'll see later,
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.000]   depending something that came up to me
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.720]   that was very interesting in the literature
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.480]   is how different things can be for men
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.320]   and women in retirement.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.920]   But anyway, men tend not to be as good
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.160]   at forming relationships as women.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.320]   And there's a huge literature that that's important.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.760]   And I wanna, oh, just two things.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.220]   The literature I'm gonna tell you about
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.960]   is pre-COVID.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.620]   So even though I'm up to date with the COVID statistics,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.840]   this wasn't so much what's covered in COVID.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.360]   If you wanna know about that,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.560]   and I'll just give you the punchline to that
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.800]   is I just wrote an article.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.160]   People over 60 have been doing the best during COVID
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.660]   in terms of mental wellbeing.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.300]   So we figure out how to have our connections, our purpose.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.400]   Let me see if there's something else I was thinking about.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.840]   Oh, the other thing I wanted to tell you,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.540]   the research says that usually when people start retiring,
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.040]   there's kind of this honeymoon phase.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.760]   They're so happy to have time to think they're free
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.420]   to do what they want or away from a boss
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.920]   they didn't like, whatever it is.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.800]   They're so happy that most people do well in the beginning.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.880]   And then there's a major dip.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.220]   The literature does not talk about when this happens.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.660]   So I can tell you experientially what I've observed,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.860]   but the literature is consistent.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.060]   Usually people are really glad.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.820]   Then there's an absolute major dip when people wake up to,
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.500]   is this all there is?
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.180]   I've already gone to every restaurant
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.740]   or I've traveled everywhere.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.060]   Now what?
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.460]   They wake up to that and then it usually stabilizes.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.340]   So most people are at least as happy in retirement
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.820]   as they were before,
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.340]   but about 25% of people have trouble adjusting
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.340]   and 10% at least just can't be happy.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.620]   They have not figured it out.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.620]   So is that good?
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.660]   Did I do okay with that one?
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.180]   - I think there's a lot of insight there
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.940]   and it almost implies one shouldn't wait until retirement
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.060]   to start exploring happiness, right?
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.820]   One should. - Oh, totally.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.300]   Like there's so much research already
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.860]   and it's accessible, digestible.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.980]   It's not just academic.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.700]   I mean, the self-help section is kind of infinite.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.660]   So yeah, that was great.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.760]   And I think it's a great segue into our next question,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.620]   which is how far in advance of retirement
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.860]   is it helpful to start shifting to a retirement mindset
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.100]   with regard to goals, purpose, et cetera?
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.180]   And the question asker says,
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.540]   I realize this will be highly individual,
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.980]   but hearing what's typical
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.020]   would be a helpful reference point.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.500]   In terms of reference point,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.860]   the reference here is financial.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.580]   I know that your suggestions
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.520]   won't be financial necessarily,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.660]   but the reference point they're citing
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.780]   is akin to when pre-retirees typically start shifting
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.060]   from equity to bonds
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.340]   or more conservative shifting ratio on the financial side.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.540]   - Would it be okay with you if I answered it
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.500]   instead of financial,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.140]   if I answer it about thinking about your life,
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.020]   when you should start planning?
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.740]   That way? - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.980]   - And let me also say,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.500]   I was kind of stunned and amazed
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   at how informed people are in your group.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.340]   It's really amazing that you're just way ahead
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.280]   of most people thinking about it.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.460]   So in terms of planning,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.020]   there is, again, no definite answer,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.780]   but I'm gonna give you an example of somebody,
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.700]   two people to illustrate it.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.580]   One person was a university professor.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.460]   She said she started 10 years in advance of everything.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.100]   The people that I'm relaying information
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.860]   would say they're having a successful retirement
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.620]   and they were able to do it financially.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.180]   So she would say it took her at least 10 years in advance.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.900]   I wanna tell you about Arthur.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.180]   When I use names, they're people's real names
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.900]   and they've all given me permission
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.060]   from the hundreds of people I've interviewed.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.780]   Anyway, Arthur retired from Google when he was 47.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.220]   And I guess that's about eight years ago
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.100]   when I first interviewed him.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.460]   And when he interviewed, when he retired,
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.580]   he was responsible largely as one of the main people.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.740]   He was an early Googler
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.220]   and he was responsible for text messaging.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.100]   So he had the opportunity, should I retire or not?
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.620]   He wasn't planning on it.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.060]   He didn't grow up wealthy,
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.860]   but two things made him wanna retire.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.340]   One is people said to him, if you have the chance,
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.700]   if you have young children to spend time with them, do it.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.460]   And that, he and his wife, who also was professional,
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.460]   they both decided to do it.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.780]   And in terms of planning, he knew this woman
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.940]   who was 103 years old, who retired when she was 50.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.300]   And she told him, you better start planning in advance.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.340]   You do not wanna wake up one day
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.580]   and kind of jump off a cliff.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.140]   People don't like to be adrift.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.660]   It's a very bad feeling, plan in advance.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.500]   And he listened to this woman and what he did,
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.500]   he started thinking about it years in advance
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   before he retired, but two years in advance,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.940]   he started getting very serious about his planning.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.020]   And he started writing down three categories.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.860]   One is projects he wanted to work on,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.660]   goals he wanted to achieve,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.140]   and his description of what he wanted
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.660]   a typical day to look like.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.660]   And he knew he better be concrete and specific
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.500]   and build in a routine.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.180]   He had had a life that had a major schedule always,
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.020]   and he didn't wanna all of a sudden have no schedule.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.500]   So that helped him.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.460]   And now I wanna tell you about somebody else, Leslie.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.540]   Leslie was very big in mental health
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.820]   in the state of California.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.820]   And by trying to retire, she took a less huge position,
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.580]   but still very big.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.500]   And she planned with her husband
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.940]   all the things they were gonna do.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.380]   So it was very good planning.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.500]   But shortly before she retired,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.380]   her husband died and then her dog died.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.020]   And what she has told me, and this woman is amazing.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   I only met her by interviewing her
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.940]   and have spoken to her many times.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.220]   She actually can enjoy life.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.940]   And it was such a shock.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.180]   They were a tight couple
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.940]   that didn't really have other friends.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.580]   So they didn't do that.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.700]   And all of a sudden she was left by herself.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.020]   What do you do?
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.620]   But what she did, she shifted her planning
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.620]   from instead of thinking ahead months or days or years,
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.620]   she now plans her days based on what she called elements,
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.380]   things that are important to her.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.380]   I would use the word maybe values.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.540]   What do you want to have happen in your day?
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.380]   And she uses these elements
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.060]   to determine how she's gonna do her day.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.980]   Physical activity, social connection,
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.180]   meditation, creativity.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.220]   And for her, that could be cooking or writing
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.580]   or a musical activity and service to others.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.180]   And if you wanted to ever know more specifically,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.620]   I can tell you what she does
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.540]   because it follows from her work.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.180]   But as this person who ran mental health in the state,
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.260]   she also started meditating many years before.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.020]   So in retirement, one of the things she does
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.380]   is teaches other people meditation
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.940]   from people living in old age homes to lawyers,
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.500]   to people she mentors.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.060]   So I don't have an exact answer for planning,
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.980]   but that gives you an idea
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.500]   because it's not in the literature.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.820]   And I will tell you what I know about,
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.620]   well, I'll tell you right now.
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.460]   Terms of planning, the literature is very, again, clear.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.060]   One of the most important things
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.540]   if you wanna have a successful retirement is to plan.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.540]   And people who plan figure out not just their money,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.060]   how it's gonna be with their time,
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.300]   because that's a really big one.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.460]   Usually when people plan,
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.820]   they plan as if it's gonna be a weekend, a long weekend.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.300]   Yay, I have free time.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.100]   Those are the planners.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.820]   They're not good planners,
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.060]   but the people are like, oh, I'll figure it out.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.180]   I've always wanted to something.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.620]   It just doesn't go that way.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.340]   You could have up to 20 years of retirement.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.780]   So that's a long time.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.140]   And by the way, retirement now is more an evolving process
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.420]   where we used to say it was an oxymoron
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.540]   that people worked during retirement.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.980]   Now it's becoming more the new normal.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.340]   And oftentimes it's defined purpose.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.180]   But in terms of planning, you ask what's typical.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.900]   If you look at the literature from social security,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.900]   about 22% of people spend six months
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.060]   before they retire dealing with it.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.860]   Another 22% up to a year.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.460]   The research has 38% of people don't plan at all.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.580]   And most people are sorry when they retire
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.540]   that they didn't plan.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.540]   The other thing is people plan for their own happiness.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.580]   But if you look at the literature on behavioral economics,
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.260]   people can't predict well, what will make them happy.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.900]   Or for example, with retirement,
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.100]   41% of people retire earlier
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.460]   than they said they were ever gonna retire.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.500]   So I could give you more of that statistics,
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.540]   but I hope that gives the person an idea
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.020]   of how I think, oh, about planning.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.940]   And my research found something new that got published
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.220]   that is not in the literature.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.340]   Planning is very important.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.340]   And what I found and Arthur illustrated,
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.740]   implement things before you retire.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.660]   In other words, if you think you might wanna take a class
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.300]   or you might wanna get an animal
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.940]   or whatever it is you wanna do, try something.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.940]   It doesn't matter whether that's what you like or not.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.220]   It's the act of being actively engaged
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.820]   and trying to figure out.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.780]   You wanna start trying that because like I said,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.260]   it's evolving, you're gonna change.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.900]   So, okay.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.740]   - Yeah, well, thanks Jill.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.620]   That makes perfect sense
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.620]   so that you're not newly testing something in retirement
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.660]   so that it's not the first time to adjust
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.460]   and make these kind of tweaks to make it work.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.900]   You've already tested it perhaps decades before,
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.780]   at least years before so that you're ready
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.700]   and you know what works or what doesn't work, right?
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.500]   So that you enter retirement with more familiarity.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.580]   I think that's a great segue to our next question.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.180]   You mentioned the importance of a few things,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.420]   planning and community specifically.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.980]   So this question is in terms of building community
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.860]   and friendships in the real world,
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.140]   so many retirees seem to cling to Zoom.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.900]   There simply seems to be fewer people available
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.460]   to build friendships with than I planned.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.780]   Any suggestions?
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.140]   - First of all, I wanna tell you
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.140]   these questions are exactly right on.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.980]   You are bringing up the real issues
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.340]   that people live with in retirement.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.060]   So I'm gonna say a big theory name,
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.860]   Karstensen is the person
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.460]   and so much literature on aging,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.260]   retirement, successful, this and that,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.620]   they quote Karstensen.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.860]   And she has this theory
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.580]   called socio-emotional selectivity theory.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.180]   And what she says in her theory,
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.780]   and there's a lot of research to support it,
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.740]   is that as people get older, their timeframe shifts.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.260]   We shift to how much time we have left
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.060]   and we shift to closer relationships
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.180]   and don't wanna make new friendships.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.980]   So that doesn't mean it doesn't happen,
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.940]   but the questioner is exactly right.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.220]   It's tough, people don't wanna do it.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.860]   So they wanna focus on their close relationship.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.180]   So say again, was the person saying,
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.420]   "How do you do it?"
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.820]   Or "Should I do it?"
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.500]   - Basically suggestions to broaden their community.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.700]   They expected to be able to meet others
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.500]   and connect with others more easily,
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.900]   but they're finding fewer people in retirement
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.580]   than they'd expected.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.460]   And probably a comparison of Zoom.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.260]   So they're finding that a lot of retirees
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.140]   to quote cling to Zoom.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.100]   So I guess Zoom is its own community
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:08.100]   and then how to broaden the more typical physical community.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.580]   - Okay, I'm gonna have to make up some ideas
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.740]   based on my life and what people have told me they've done.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.100]   There isn't an abundance of research,
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.660]   but I'm gonna tell this person
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.860]   something that's hard and interesting,
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.620]   which is I wanna tell them about pets
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.300]   and about going solo.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.700]   I don't know if you know this,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.740]   but since the '80s, there's been this phenomena
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.340]   of people wanting to live alone.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:46.340]   So right now, 28% of people in our country live alone.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.100]   That is a more common way to live
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.820]   than the nuclear family.
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.220]   More people live alone than in a nuclear family.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.940]   It's only comparable to childless couples.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.900]   They're the highest family structure.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.180]   And the reason I'm saying this is people that live alone,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.780]   one out of three boomers live alone.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.660]   One out of three retirees live alone.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.140]   And people are choosing it.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.060]   It's not that they want, if they had a partner to die,
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.660]   but if the partner dies,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.460]   people are choosing more to be on their own.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.300]   And what that is encouraging is people that live alone
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.580]   are more likely to go out
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.980]   and be involved in their community.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.420]   So actually, it was very hard for people living alone
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.940]   during COVID because you'll see the literature on couples,
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.540]   good couples, it really helped people during COVID.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.940]   And the people living alone
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.860]   were very attached to their community.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.140]   They're already giving and doing all these things.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.620]   And during COVID, they couldn't do it.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.100]   So why I'm bringing that up about one out of three people,
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.860]   they in non-COVID times,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.180]   and who knows what it'll be
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.140]   as we hopefully emerge from this,
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.100]   they go out and meet people and want friends
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.140]   and want to contribute to things.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.260]   So there are people that even though the theory
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.140]   is we want to stay with whom we know and get closer,
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.100]   first of all, people are wanting to put time into it.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.420]   And there are more people available now to do it.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.340]   The other thing is for men,
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.660]   I would say definitely don't wait for retirement.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.420]   What the literature says, men at retirement
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.380]   have a hard time making friends
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.540]   or keeping people that they had at work.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.020]   They have not developed the social structure
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.100]   or the skills to have friendships.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.500]   And then they rely on their partner.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.500]   So heterosexual or gay, one person is relying.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.780]   And you'll see if we get to that question,
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.900]   that's tough on a couple.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.220]   So I actually, I'm an introvert
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.500]   and I have my long-term 50-year relationship friendships,
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   but I made some friendships during retirement.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.500]   And I'm a person who goes for my interests.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.900]   So I like to learn.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.940]   I've gone back to the university and I'm taking courses
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.980]   and I've met people in courses.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.300]   We are like-minded.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.340]   And this is the same as the literature.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.060]   If you're telling college students how to make friends,
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.580]   you try to do it based on your own interests.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.020]   So say Yuri and I were in the same history class,
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.260]   at least we have that in common.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.580]   I'm not taking a course I don't want
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.580]   in the hopes to meet Yuri, because, Yuri,
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:53.580]   because I wanna meet him or make friends.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.620]   I'm taking things that are interesting for me.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.500]   So at least I'll get that need met.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.460]   And then if we meet, it's possible,
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.300]   we'll have something to talk about
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.100]   and we have similar interests.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.140]   And where I live,
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.900]   we have this thing called Osher Lifelong Learners.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.100]   They're over 900 members.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.180]   It's national, but it's very different all over.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.580]   So mine has over 900 members of people like us.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.900]   And pre-COVID, we would meet in person.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.340]   And we have over 50 interest groups.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.860]   So it could be cooking.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.660]   It could be speaking French.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.780]   It could be social sciences.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.300]   It could be investing.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.500]   It could be taking hikes.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.580]   I think you have nothing to lose to do something like that.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.980]   It doesn't cost you anything.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.260]   We pay a little bit to be members
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.420]   and that just goes to college student scholarships.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.180]   But they have classes.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:52.100]   It's a very small commitment for a big payoff.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.540]   And the other way I think you might meet people,
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.380]   and I like to try and do two things at once.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.580]   So let's meet your purpose and maybe you'll meet people.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.580]   So maybe you find a way of volunteering,
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.380]   and that's a whole other issue.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.100]   But there's something that feels valuable to you
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.700]   and you go for training for that.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.260]   You could maybe meet like-minded people that way.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.300]   But I wouldn't wait for retirement
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.460]   'cause as you said, it's gonna be harder.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.940]   So you gotta give me just a little feedback
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.660]   since I'm answering such long.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.220]   - Yeah, no, I think that was great.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.100]   There was a lot there.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.500]   I'll highlight a few things that resonated,
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.140]   I think with the earlier questions
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.100]   as well as upcoming questions.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.700]   One is you can try out different things
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.180]   and see what resonates with you, right?
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.380]   Meaning you, meaning the broader audience.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.300]   So that whether it's taking classes or volunteering
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.220]   or meeting one's neighbors,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.980]   these things have commonality by design, right?
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.500]   Like if you chose a class,
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.180]   other people in that class share that interest.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.300]   And then going back to the earlier questioners,
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.380]   the crux of the question,
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.500]   if it implied feeling isolated,
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.780]   there may be other people who feel isolated
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.820]   and wanna meet other people too.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.060]   So that's a commonality.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.260]   One doesn't need to feel alone in their isolation.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.140]   That might sound odd,
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.060]   but there are many other people who feel isolated
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.980]   who are just as easily willing and able to connect.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.300]   And all it takes is like a hello sometimes
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   in a hallway or a pantry or a sidewalk or community space.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.700]   So those are things that at least resonated with me
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.260]   from your response, Jill,
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.020]   that if you try these things out before retirement,
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.660]   you can see what worked for you
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.860]   so that by the time you're in retirement,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.380]   you're more practiced in meeting others
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.340]   and connecting with others and figuring out,
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.260]   okay, I tried this community or church or volunteering
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.140]   and that didn't work,
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.340]   but I can try this camera club or book club
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.260]   or whatever it is.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.980]   It sounds like there are many options available.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.100]   Why don't we develop some of what you said
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.460]   with the next question?
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.780]   You spoke about men in retirement tendencies.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.500]   Maybe if you can elaborate on that.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.700]   This question is,
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.260]   do men or women have a different experience in retirement
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.860]   and what differences are there by gender?
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.220]   And of course, some of this will be generalized,
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.740]   but Jill, you have so much data
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.980]   and interview-based experiences.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.020]   Whatever you can present counts.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.620]   - Okay, so I'll tell you this.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.820]   And if you can help me remember later,
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.580]   it's kind of a sweet thing about pets,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.020]   the importance of pets that in the COVID research,
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.900]   I found it more than before.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.300]   Anyway, men and women, yeah,
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.580]   they tend to have a very different experience.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.660]   I'll start with some stuff about women.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.660]   First of all, women are so focused on taking care of others.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.540]   And you know how women get pushed out of careers
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.660]   to stay home with children.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.340]   For women, they don't think about retirement
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.940]   as well financially, and they don't plan.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.300]   So women that end up as widows or single
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.420]   tend to have more issues, financial issues,
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.380]   be less wealthy than men.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.700]   And that's a big issue because you need finances
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.460]   to make other choices.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.460]   So women tend to end up economically insecure.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.300]   And women in retirement,
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.420]   so again, these are generalizations,
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.180]   but you'll see they make sense.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.900]   And I can tell you the data.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.340]   Women tend not to be as satisfied in retirement as men
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.540]   because the burdens of family life
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.500]   is that we tend to keep it.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.180]   So here we're not just taking care of maybe children,
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.820]   and some people, we're so geared towards other,
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.980]   we're taking care of children.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.860]   Now we're taking care of our parents, our grandchildren,
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.340]   our sisters, our brothers.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.380]   And it kind of goes on like that.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.580]   If you look at the literature
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.060]   of who's taking care of whom during dementia, caretaker,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.940]   it's the women, it doesn't stop.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.940]   And women over 65 who have a partner
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:33.700]   tend to spend an hour more a day with domestic work
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.340]   than they ever did before
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.980]   from cooking and cleaning and stuff like that.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:44.300]   So the other thing is women tend to be so other-oriented
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.020]   that they continue with these responsibilities.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   And then we tend to volunteer more taking care of others.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.220]   For men, a bigger issue is retiring from a job
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.740]   that the man felt really good about
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.620]   makes it more likely he's gonna have a hard time.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.460]   So women can do better leaving their jobs.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.220]   I'll say a couple more things about men,
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.060]   but the thing about women in jobs,
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.220]   for many women, their jobs,
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.860]   if it's a good job or a good career,
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.940]   helps them feel good about themselves.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.340]   It's outside all their domestic responsibilities.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.740]   They can feel good about it
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.500]   and it can limit the time that they do domestic.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.700]   So a lot of times women, we don't know how to say no
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.940]   and other people know to ask us,
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.140]   will you take care of my kid?
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.260]   Will you drive my neighbor?
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.100]   Will you blah, blah, blah?
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.740]   And we say, yes, yes, yes.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:53.020]   Where if we can say, I can't, I'm working, it's better.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.340]   You'll see, even being grandparents,
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.580]   there's some literature that women like being grandparents
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.420]   better when they work than when they retired.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.140]   Not always, but that was a gender issue that came up.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.020]   For men, I said the issue of it's harder adjustment
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.140]   if they really like their jobs.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.180]   It's harder having friendships.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.420]   They, maybe they thought they had friends at work,
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.620]   but they didn't necessarily meet with them outside.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.340]   They're not sure what to do.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:31.140]   But the good thing for men is they tend to,
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.700]   in retirement, find better purpose.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.540]   And we're not sure is that because
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.460]   they tend to take work longer
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.940]   or go back to work.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.540]   And here's like a male, female agenda.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.900]   And usually you'll see my thing says, she, they.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.180]   I try to not be so binary, but the literature is binary.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.180]   It's she, he.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:02.180]   So anyway, like if your husband is sick,
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.780]   woman, heterosexual woman,
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.140]   you are 50% more likely to retire.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.820]   Reverse it, man, your wife is sick.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.660]   You're 50% less likely to retire.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.220]   And if you have dementia,
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.740]   so we won't get too much into health issues
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.980]   'cause that could take forever,
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.460]   but imagine you're going down this horrible path of dementia.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.500]   Most women don't get informal care at home.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.540]   They don't stay at home
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.700]   because who's gonna take care of the woman?
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.700]   Is it their adult child?
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.020]   Who's gonna take care of the man?
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   The wife.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.980]   So that just gives you ideas of things that come up
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.580]   later in life in retirement
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.820]   that are different for men and women.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.060]   - Okay.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.100]   That's great to hear the,
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.300]   because you have so much factual evidence.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.780]   I think that really helps a lot of people.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.460]   I'll jokingly highlight one thing you said,
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.900]   which is men have a harder time
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.980]   if they enjoyed their work.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.820]   So maybe a takeaway there is guys should find a job
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.300]   they really dislike a few years before retiring.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.940]   You touched on some things
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.500]   that lead into our next question,
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.860]   which is as a stay-at-home mom and raising the kids
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.500]   while my spouse worked a lot of hours,
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.300]   how can I transition to a new life experience
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.860]   where we're together 24/7?
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.700]   And I'll add to the question,
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.180]   which is need folks be together 24/7,
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.500]   or can you talk about the alternatives,
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   like volunteering with separate friends
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   and separate, you know, separate pursuits.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.900]   - Asking this question, it's so insightful.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.500]   I actually hadn't realized how much problems
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.420]   couples could have in retirement.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.620]   I thought it was gonna be, you know,
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.940]   people say, "Oh, I'm gonna this.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.060]   I can't wait to retire.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.740]   We're gonna have all this time."
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.820]   It's not always like that.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.180]   It's not so great.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.220]   In the beginning of retirement,
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.540]   couples tend to have more tension.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.260]   And a big reason is what this person brought up.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.180]   You're used to your own space,
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.060]   whether it's your office or a stay-at-home person,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.260]   that's their office, whether it was their kitchen
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.780]   or they have NPR on or whatever they do.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.380]   People revealed to me, and then the literature supports,
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.140]   space is a really big issue.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.500]   And people have conflict over it.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.580]   And some of the people that responded to me
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.580]   went to extreme lengths to get their husbands
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.660]   not just involved in other things,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.780]   but involved outside of the house.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.100]   So remember, this is pre-COVID.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.900]   One woman even built, is the word aviary?
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.100]   The, you know, where you have birds?
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.100]   And outside, aviary, outside of their house
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.060]   to even get them out of the house.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.620]   So here's when you asked me what to do.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.980]   First of all, if your partner is there now,
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.820]   maybe you could go read this section, not this minute,
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.140]   but of my research that is about couples.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.460]   So you both can be informed and say,
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.500]   "Wow, this could be difficult.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.780]   We weren't thinking this way."
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.900]   Here's like a funny quote.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.900]   When the CFO of Google retired, his name was Patrick Pichette,
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:53.580]   he said, upon giving his leaving notice, he said,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.300]   "Tamara and I will be celebrating our 25th anniversary.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.260]   When our kids are asked by their friends
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.460]   about the success of the longevity of our marriage,
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.500]   they simply joke that Tamara and I
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.900]   have spent so little time together
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.820]   that it's really too early to tell
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.220]   if our marriage will in fact succeed."
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.180]   So that's kind of funny, tongue in cheek.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.460]   However, it's really what happens in the literature.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.220]   Couples can have a really hard time in the beginning.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.060]   And then if they make it through,
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.060]   they're in really the best shape.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.540]   So when I think about this, if I was that woman,
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.020]   I'd be thinking about, I'm home alone now,
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.140]   what's really important to me?
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.940]   Is it that I have a space?
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.340]   I got used to my kitchens, my own,
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.260]   and I know I'm saying gender things,
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.060]   but these things are really true and they do come up.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.380]   I've had women say to me, more than men,
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.900]   "You know what? I like having NPR on."
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.140]   I've had women say, "I have my computer to myself all day."
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.580]   And all of a sudden he's saying,
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.980]   "Who are you writing to? What are you doing?"
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.780]   So if these things are important to you,
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.980]   that you have your own space,
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:15.900]   then think about in advance, what do I not wanna lose?
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.020]   I like, for example, maybe taking my dog for a walk
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.260]   by myself, or I like spending time
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.020]   with my friends by myself.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.020]   You're gonna see if your life is like the literature,
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.340]   the man comes in and now he's dependent on you.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.700]   He's just so excited to have time with you,
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.300]   and he doesn't have these other people,
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.980]   he wants to do these things with you.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.580]   And by the way, people say they're gonna do
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.820]   all these leisurely things together.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.820]   I think it's over half, it's higher than over half,
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.300]   couples say it, but only like 24% of people do.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.100]   So again, we don't necessarily predict how it's gonna be.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.220]   But I would spend some time myself on saying,
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.420]   "What's really important?"
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.500]   And before you get in that situation,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.380]   try and talk to your partner about it
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.700]   and say, "This is what the literature says.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.860]   What are you gonna want?"
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.940]   Because people are so not concrete,
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.860]   either to themselves or to each other.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.300]   You'll read stories where people will say,
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.540]   "We were retired.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.940]   I thought we were gonna move to New York City
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.300]   and walk around and explore New York."
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.300]   The other one says, "Retirement?
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.620]   I wanna be home and travel abroad."
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.300]   So they each thought they knew what they wanted,
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.580]   they never talked about it,
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.460]   and then they're very disappointed
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.500]   because now one's wanting to move,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.580]   the other one's wanting to travel.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.220]   So the more you can get concrete in your head,
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.780]   "What is working for me?
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.540]   What would I like to see continue?"
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.580]   Maybe you say, "You know, I get up.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.260]   When my partner goes to work,
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.540]   I have an hour to myself where I exercise
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.900]   or I call my kids or I read a book or whatever."
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.220]   You don't have that if two people are in the same space.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.340]   What is it?
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.780]   Try and think through concretely what it is.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.660]   Once you're in that situation,
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.100]   people get their feelings hurt.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.660]   "Oh, you don't want me around?
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.940]   Oh, is that what you're saying?
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.860]   Oh, I'm annoying you."
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.900]   If you say it in advance,
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.380]   people aren't in the middle of it and upset.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.780]   So as much as you can think it through,
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.340]   look at the litter and say,
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.940]   "Oh boy, the literature, it says this could happen.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.140]   What could we do to make it better for us?"
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.780]   So does that seem helpful?
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.100]   - Yeah, that's absolutely helpful.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.940]   And I think it aligns with a lot of the Boglehead work
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.700]   of building portfolios and figuring out withdrawal,
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.380]   you know, formulas and timing.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.460]   A lot of it revolves around how do you envision retirement?
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.700]   And so this is probably a thing,
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.300]   something that folks have already hopefully practiced,
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.580]   how do they envision retirement?
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.700]   And like you're saying,
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.900]   spouses can have very different visions of it,
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.540]   but as long as you talk about it in advance,
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.460]   you're not clashing as much when the time comes.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.860]   Something else that came to mind as you described it,
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.580]   just the value of time alone.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.860]   So I think time alone, a personal space,
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.180]   and I think this doesn't come up
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.580]   in the typical financial conversations, right?
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.780]   We're focused on what our portfolio can generate
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.780]   and how to get there and all these things,
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.140]   but I don't know that enough folks
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.740]   are really playing out the physicality
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.620]   of sharing a space 24/7 or, you know,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.260]   having a private space or sharing a space
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.860]   that used to feel private because someone else wasn't there.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.260]   So yeah, I think there was a lot of wisdom there.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.700]   I'll just share this one comment.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.700]   The comedian joked that when he goes on vacation,
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.860]   the whole family packs into the car
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.860]   and his vacation is when he closes his wife's door,
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.660]   the passenger side, walks around the back of the car
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.940]   and gets to the driver's side door.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.140]   That's his vacation.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.540]   Once he sits in the car and closes the door,
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.620]   there's no peace of mind, you know,
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.980]   that would typically come vacation.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.700]   So it was humorous how he presented it,
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.860]   but I think there's a lot of truth in that.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:24.100]   Similar to a lot of what you mentioned,
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.420]   this next question, it appears to be from a widowed woman,
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.620]   but it could apply to, you know,
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.740]   still married or single woman or anyone
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:40.260]   who's transitioning from working full-time to retirement.
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.020]   So I'll read it as it's presented.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.620]   Any suggestions for a widowed woman
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.140]   who's likely retiring in the next year
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.180]   on adjusting to life without full-time work?
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:41:01.060]   - Well, gee, again, it's a hard and very insightful question.
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.020]   Women in heterosexual relationships tend to live longer.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.020]   We can spend 15 to 20 years alone, typically.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.180]   And so there's the beginning and then it keeps going.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.020]   So how to plan?
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.820]   I think all the things we've been talking about,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.860]   what are your interests?
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.300]   What can you do before you retire
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.780]   that seem like something you might wanna do?
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   So do you have a goal?
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.060]   Maybe you've never exercised and that's an interest
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.700]   and you wanna see if you want, don't wait, try now.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.980]   It doesn't matter if it works or not.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.540]   And I would say friendships, which hopefully you have them
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.540]   because women are better at that.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.380]   If you can rely on friendships
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.980]   and talking to them about what you do.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:03.740]   And if we have time tonight or another time,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.620]   I really think our best resources are each other.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.620]   I can tell you the literature,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.620]   but there are probably other women here
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:15.420]   who have gone through this and that they can tell you,
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.420]   this is what I did.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.780]   This worked, this didn't work, it changed.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.620]   So if there are things that you thought
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.060]   you've wanted to learn,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.060]   maybe you can go take a course at the university.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:35.060]   Maybe you could something, do art with a group of people
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:39.180]   that you try it.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.300]   If you don't like it,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.220]   you don't have to go back the second time.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.260]   But things like our Osher Lifelong Learner,
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.740]   if you were here, I would say, definitely check it out
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.060]   because it's a very low commitment.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.700]   All you have to do is go
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.420]   and you can leave right in the middle of the meeting.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.860]   It's just, there's 900 of us.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.540]   So we're in all different situations.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.340]   And if you took like a social interest group
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.420]   or when I was doing focus groups on retirement,
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.860]   you're bound to meet people,
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.660]   or then you see them again and you go, oh, hi, I saw you.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   So whatever you've done in the rest of your life
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.420]   to make friends, to be involved,
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.780]   I would say, try doing it now.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.340]   There's an enormous literature for everybody
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.180]   about the importance of exercise.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.340]   So if I could encourage you to exercise,
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.820]   and I wanna tell you something that came out
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.700]   in the COVID literature about pets,
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.380]   how much pets helped people during COVID.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.100]   Cats and dogs are what they wrote about,
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.060]   and dogs even more than cats.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.740]   First of all, any animal,
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.700]   it said it gave people an excuse
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:01.700]   both to have something to touch and to talk out loud.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.860]   I have not reviewed this literature,
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.260]   but since I've thought about it,
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.860]   I don't even know if there is a literature.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.340]   I think people have a need to talk out loud.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.900]   When I'm walking at the beach, I live in Santa Cruz.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.820]   So I start my day unlike when I worked.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.300]   When I worked, I was on the bus by 6.30 a.m. commuting.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.980]   Now I am at the beach walking my dog.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.700]   Anyway, people just talk to you about random things.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.420]   They just, "Oh, look at this."
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.780]   So I think having an animal,
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.100]   and what they say about dogs more than cats,
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.100]   dogs during COVID, but this could be generalizing,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.460]   give you a routine.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.300]   They make you go out
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.660]   where a cat does not make you have to exercise.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.140]   You don't have to with a dog,
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.900]   but it's preferred if you're gonna get a dog.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.300]   And dogs make it more likely
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   that you might interact with other people.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:59.060]   So anyway, those are like, if you were wanting an animal,
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.180]   it might be a good time to start thinking
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.340]   about how you could get an animal.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.060]   But then you might go to a class about training your animal,
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.020]   and then there are other like-minded people.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.220]   So that's, I would say, go with your interests.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.700]   Try and find purpose.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.420]   In retirement, women tend to volunteer more.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.820]   When we volunteer, oh, I'll tell you about men too.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.380]   When we volunteer, it's usually helping others.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.420]   Men tend to be administrators,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.020]   and what men tend to like is mentoring.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:36.020]   So widow, widower, if there's a situation
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.900]   where you could have ongoing mentoring
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.300]   of somebody that was in your field,
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   or a child that the courts have pulled out of their home,
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.740]   people tend to like helping others.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.700]   And it's a chance to do it.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.740]   I'd like to think more what else a woman could do
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.500]   other than everything that I've said before.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.260]   So maybe it'll come to me now,
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.340]   or maybe I could write to her another time.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.180]   - That sounds great.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.500]   Well, thanks for those great suggestions.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.340]   There was a lot there, and I think it builds
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.180]   on a lot of the other things you said earlier.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:18.180]   Al, also, for folks who are commenting in the chat,
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.700]   there's a lot of shared wisdom there within the community.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.460]   You mentioned dog walking, Jill.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:27.580]   Someone, I think, jokingly said, "My dog walks us."
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.540]   And I think a lot of us who, pre-retirement,
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.860]   just walking around your neighborhood,
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.620]   you see certain times a day,
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.540]   there are definitely dog walking sort of communities.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.500]   Like you see the same people, right?
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.860]   The same time of day, the same kind of dog walking route.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.700]   So you become friends with these people sometimes,
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.220]   and that becomes your community.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.140]   So again, it's practicing things well before retirement.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.140]   The next question relates to what you just addressed,
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.180]   and I think you answered some of it.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.940]   I'll read it, but to not be redundant.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.820]   I think it's still worth asking,
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.020]   but there's an aspect to it
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.940]   that maybe you can elaborate more on.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.460]   So I'll read the question.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.500]   "I've been a workaholic my whole life,
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.740]   "and fear the free time will kill me.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.020]   "How should I adjust?"
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.340]   So I think practically and emotionally,
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.380]   you've given a lot of suggestions.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.260]   And again, the chat has very specific resources
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.300]   about volunteer groups and meetups.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.900]   So how about, is there an emotional component
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.900]   that people need to transition to or towards
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.500]   if their time had been occupied,
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.860]   and now they have maybe volunteer
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.380]   or community things to fill it,
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.820]   but is there an emotional transition as well?
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.460]   - Yeah, and let me tell you something.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:50.260]   I just read an article that just came out very recently
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.100]   about discretionary time.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.380]   It was really interesting.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.500]   It's people in business, Wharton,
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.140]   but it's psychological is what they're saying.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.620]   You know how when you work,
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.780]   most people are like, "I don't have enough time.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.140]   "It was a famine of time.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.420]   "I feel stressed."
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.180]   Well, then the opposite they wanna look at,
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:15.420]   if you have too much time, how is that for you?
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.700]   And people don't feel productive.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.620]   They feel bad.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.900]   People don't wanna feel adrift.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.900]   So this research says the best amount
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.900]   of discretionary time in a day,
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.500]   time when you can do just what you wanna do.
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.060]   And for me, a lot of that is just reading and learning,
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.300]   but it's still, it's my time that I'm wanting it now.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.580]   They say two hours a day.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.500]   From zero to two, it goes up.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.900]   From two to five hours, it's peak.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.220]   So whether you have two hours or five hours,
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.340]   it doesn't get better.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.060]   And after five hours, it goes down.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.060]   So that might help the person.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.900]   I don't have research that says
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.820]   too much free time will kill you.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.980]   But like you're saying, it's not a good idea.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.740]   Loneliness might kill people.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.220]   Not having a purpose might kill people.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.300]   If you look at what correlates.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.540]   So what I would say for this person,
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.300]   if you could be thinking ahead,
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.140]   are there things I wanted to do?
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.020]   What could be my purpose?
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.540]   And there is a literature on how to find your purpose.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.900]   And one, a myth is people should do
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.940]   what they're passionate about.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:38.940]   Well, a lot of people don't have passions and never do.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.900]   And a lot of times when you start something new
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.340]   and you start doing well at it, it can become a passion.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.820]   So try things.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.580]   And the literature says people in retirement
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.340]   that try new things, they give it the label innovators,
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.460]   they are happier.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.660]   So I would say for this person, very astute question.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.660]   It's too many hours in a day, let alone 20 years of it.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.620]   Think concretely like Arthur did.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.700]   What would I like a day to look like?
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.100]   What do I wanna put in there?
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:21.900]   Or as Leslie gave you an idea, think about your values.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.940]   What's important to you?
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.900]   So you might, or from this, maybe you say,
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.100]   I'm not even sure.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.500]   I'm so geared towards working or taking care of others.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.900]   I don't even know anymore what I want,
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.260]   which is unfortunately very true for many people.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.580]   Many people don't reflect, they just do.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.340]   I would say, well, Jill said,
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.100]   it's important to have friendships.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.500]   Jill said, it's important to have purpose.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.380]   It's important to exercise.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.580]   Maybe if you don't know what you want,
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.020]   you could at least take from the literature,
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.940]   I'm gonna start trying to fill my life
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.500]   with some of these things and see how it goes.
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.580]   And then you'll say,
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:07.140]   gee, I have no idea how to find a purpose or an interest.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:11.740]   Then you'll either email me or a Bogle head and say,
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.780]   what did you do?
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.940]   How did you find this?
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.060]   'Cause you're gonna see there are no right and wrong answers
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.140]   where it's an evolving process
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.260]   and we're trying to learn from each other.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:27.220]   - Yeah, and I think that you can overlay that
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.260]   to so many other aspects of life, right?
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.860]   Like your favorite foods or favorite music
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.820]   or favorite cities.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.740]   You need to visit and sample
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.940]   before you really know what resonates.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.580]   And what you said hits home
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.820]   about some people not having a passion.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.660]   There's a well-known author, Cal Newport.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.820]   He's written "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.940]   and his more famous work is probably "Deep Work."
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:54.940]   And he cites as a myth, as you did, this idea of passion.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.060]   And so rather than, you know,
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.020]   it's almost cliche to advise people to pursue their passion
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.700]   in terms of career, he advises to develop something
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.420]   and then in becoming really good at it,
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.500]   you're more likely to excel at it
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.980]   and it can become a passion.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.300]   I'm paraphrasing.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.060]   He's much more in depth about the topic,
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.540]   but he tries to debunk this idea of pursue your passion
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   because that's such a, it's a very appealing thought
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.980]   that, you know, a lot of people get that advice.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:31.620]   So the other thing that came to mind from what you said
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.060]   was regret minimization.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.380]   So not just how you said, you know,
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.740]   are there things I wanted to do?
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.020]   You can also frame it as
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.980]   what will I regret not having tried, right?
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.740]   So that's one way.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:51.260]   I think this next question aligns with what you were saying,
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:55.340]   which is this feeling that people feel
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.900]   they have more to give and it not being utilized.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.220]   So I'll read the question.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.700]   How would you advise dealing
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.900]   with the sinking emotional feeling
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:08.820]   that by retiring all our hard-earned professional skills
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.460]   that are so helpful to so many people
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.340]   will be unused and wasted and all for naught?
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:19.500]   - Okay, let me tell you that that question
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.220]   could make me cry.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.140]   And the reason it can make me cry,
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.900]   it's again, very astute because
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.460]   it's not really just an individual issue.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.340]   It's a societal issue.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:38.340]   We are, I feel like we are some of the best resources
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.980]   of our country.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.740]   When you look at the literature about aging,
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.940]   yeah, our memories go down, that is in the literature,
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.980]   but our emotional stability goes up,
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.220]   our knowledge goes up, and our expertise goes up.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.380]   It's clear in the literature.
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:59.660]   The literature shows older people in so many ways
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:04.140]   have more to contribute because of those factors,
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.060]   but we're not being utilized well.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.140]   Even though if you look at the literature about work,
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.820]   over 50 is the only age category
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.540]   that seems to be increasing of people working more.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:19.300]   It's that over 50s is the biggest age group.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:24.300]   But anyway, we do have more to give.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:29.140]   And it's finding how could you give
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.300]   what would be of interest to me?
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:37.060]   Like I said, that piece, the literature says people find,
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.780]   oh, there's a word they use
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:44.580]   about when you mentor younger people or teach younger people
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.900]   and younger could be just newer in your field.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:52.460]   Generativity, that increases satisfaction.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.580]   So we're finding, you'll ask people and they'll go,
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.140]   oh, I had a job my whole life, made money that,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.500]   but now I'm teaching or now I'm working in a classroom.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.860]   I've wanted to do this, I could never afford to do it.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.660]   So are there things you wanna do
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:12.660]   either with your mind from your career or other ways?
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.340]   I would say, find a way to try doing them.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.620]   And I'll tell you, for me personally,
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.820]   oh, I'm gonna tell you two little things
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.980]   and then I'll tell you about me.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.980]   There's a big literature on gratitude.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:32.980]   So people that are more resilient and are gratitude,
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:35.980]   have gratitude, do better.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.060]   So if you could even in your day when things are funky
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:42.420]   or you're not sure what to do, if you focus on it,
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.500]   you'll probably feel better.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.180]   And when you look at the literature about depression
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.100]   or wanting to feel better,
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.300]   and I know that, am I really a cognitive psychologist?
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.940]   So I'm a clinical psychologist,
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.340]   but focus on cognitive behavioral.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   Anyway, people's thoughts affect how they feel.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   The one thing you can do that can up your mood
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.740]   quicker than anything else
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.980]   is do a kindness to somebody else.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.060]   That is not woo-woo literature.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.900]   There's a body of literature that says,
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.300]   being kind to others, you end up feeling better.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.580]   It can change race relationship.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.460]   It can do all kinds of things.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.740]   But anyway, I would encourage this person,
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.660]   think about it, you are valued.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:33.780]   Even if other people don't quite get it now,
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:36.340]   try and figure what you could do.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.540]   And when I retired, oh, I'll tell you this,
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.780]   it hasn't come up, but to me, actually,
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:45.060]   there's one thing that is consistent in the literature
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.300]   about whether you're gonna have
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.700]   a successful retirement or not,
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.620]   is whether you chose retirement or you got forced.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.660]   If you were forced in retirement,
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.580]   you're gonna feel less in control.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.140]   All these bad things happen.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.260]   So if you can choose your retirement,
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.420]   when you're gonna do it, how you're gonna do it,
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.100]   it's much more likely you're gonna plan,
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.980]   and if it's gonna go well, you'll implement things.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.420]   But for me, if I was in the literature,
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.780]   you would say I chose retirement.
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.940]   And I would say I was somewhere in between.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.580]   I got tired of bad bosses.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.420]   I had an amazing job, a career.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:25.220]   Being a professor, being a clinical psychologist
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.300]   is so meaningful, it always was.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.900]   And most of my career, I had bad bosses.
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.540]   As the literature says, most people do not like their bosses.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.100]   And at some point, I just decided
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.300]   I wasn't doing this anymore.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.220]   And I started a program at the end of my career.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.940]   I'm presenting internationally.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.820]   It's going as well as my career ever did.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:50.140]   And I was just tired of this, having bad bosses.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.340]   Anyway, so I left.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:57.300]   I already knew about me because as a university person,
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.340]   you have nine months on, you have the break.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.620]   You have, you know, like that.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.300]   Whether it's a real break or not,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.420]   whether you have to prepare, I had time off.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.740]   And I already learned in the beginning.
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:10.300]   I couldn't do well with just all this time off.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.100]   So I learned in advance,
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.420]   I better figure out what I'm gonna start doing.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.060]   So some of the things that I learned by reading,
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.940]   fortunately, I had already learned and I did.
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.900]   So it took me personally about two years
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.180]   till I got into the real swing of loving retirement,
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.540]   meaning I kept experimenting.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.900]   I thought, well, I'm psychology.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.660]   I'm learning piano in adulthood.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.420]   Maybe I could help musicians do well.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.020]   So I started helping people with ukulele in Canada
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.500]   because that's how they're...
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:49.940]   Anyway, all these things I did, I'm getting used,
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:51.700]   but it's not working for me.
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.340]   It's okay.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.620]   And I keep trying.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.700]   But then it took about two years for me to say to myself,
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.820]   you know, I don't really know how people do retirement.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:05.180]   I'm gonna read about it 'cause I'm a researcher.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.100]   I know how to do that.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.500]   I took about a year to just read
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.860]   about the retirement literature and aging
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.020]   and how do people do it.
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.900]   And then I start thinking,
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.660]   well, why would I just ask myself?
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:19.060]   I'm gonna ask the people at this OSHA lifelong learner,
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.580]   right, where there are 900 people.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.700]   And I say, I'm gonna do these interviews.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.140]   I'm gonna do focus groups.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.340]   Within 20 minutes, over 200 people signed up.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.940]   People wanna talk about their life or retirement.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.380]   Well, then after I interviewed so many people,
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.140]   I thought this is such valuable information.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.060]   I shouldn't just know this.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.100]   Other people should know.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:43.780]   Why shouldn't we enjoy this time of life?
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:47.180]   So it takes time.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.980]   I would say, don't let people tell you
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.380]   in their direct or indirect ways you're not valuable.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.860]   The literature tells you, I'm telling you,
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.860]   we are more valuable in many ways than others.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.580]   Even the science and engineering.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.100]   So, you know, I presented at Google,
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.260]   so I was up on all the tech stuff.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:14.700]   People in science and engineering even are working longer.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.860]   The median age is going up.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.500]   One out of three people in tech are over 50.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.700]   And that was as of 2010.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.540]   I don't have, there isn't more current than that.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:29.060]   So even though they get pressured to get out of tech
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.540]   'cause people say your mind isn't as quick,
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.860]   or to get pressured to be managers
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.980]   whether they want to or not, they're staying in their jobs.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:41.340]   So a lot of this is myth.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.100]   And that person, I just really hope
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:48.220]   that you could figure out what you wanna do.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.220]   Now, the thing about volunteering,
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.260]   the literature says volunteering
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.660]   makes people feel happier and meaningful.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.260]   What the literature doesn't say,
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:00.180]   and my experience is interviewing hundreds of people,
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.660]   is that they wanna volunteer.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.820]   And oftentimes they volunteer for the nonprofit
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.460]   they've always wanted to support
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.140]   and they get crappy positions.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.620]   They don't get responsible positions volunteering
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.900]   like they had before.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.620]   People don't take advantage of them.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.460]   Don't quit, you know, ask other people,
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.220]   where are you getting good experiences?
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.620]   And they can tell you, well, I work for Red Cross,
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.900]   I'm working for the Seymour Center.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.460]   They will train you, they will use your time.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:38.460]   So I encourage that person, be persistent, persistence works.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.260]   - That's great.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.700]   Jill, I want you to hold that thought.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.180]   I'm just gonna comment quickly on time remaining.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:49.180]   So as we approach a quarter after the hour,
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.140]   roughly at a quarter after we'll turn it over to the group
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.740]   for questions from the chat or questions,
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.140]   verbal questions for those who wanna present.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.340]   There are four more questions
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.300]   that I'm hoping we can get to in that time.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.300]   So that'll roughly amount to two minutes
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.940]   or so per question, yep.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:11.740]   - What I wanna say to you is I've been talking so much.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.860]   I don't know, can your listeners take more?
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.180]   Like, can you do thumbs up, thumbs down and say,
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.820]   do you need a break?
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.100]   You know, it's a lot of information from her.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.380]   Can we assess how it's going?
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:31.340]   - I think, let's assume that the audience is enjoying it
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:36.340]   and those who are at capacity can always voluntarily exit.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.700]   But I think the number of participants
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.340]   speaks for the amount of interest.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.380]   It's pretty, I think it's pretty high.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.140]   I just wanna, despite my comment on time constraints,
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:50.820]   I'll comment two things came to mind, which is gratitude.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:53.300]   As you said, the science clearly supports it.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.220]   Gratitude journal is, you know,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.140]   a very well-known way of people reinforcing
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.940]   what they feel appreciative of.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.740]   And I think some of the research even says,
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.620]   you know, the neurons in your brain can,
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:11.460]   you can grow new neurons as a result of spending time
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.740]   consciously, actively thinking about gratitude.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.660]   So that's one.
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.820]   And then folks who study stoicism,
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:20.860]   even superficially familiar with stoicism,
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.660]   gratitude is a big part of it.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.060]   One exercise is imagine you lost your sight
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.860]   or you lost a loved one today,
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:32.060]   and then you wake up tomorrow and you can see again,
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.700]   or your loved one is right there.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.340]   You can treat each day like a second life.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.860]   So obviously we all take things for granted,
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.500]   but we needn't take things for granted
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.980]   as much as we do so often.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:45.820]   So that's one.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:50.700]   - This next question focuses on volunteering,
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.060]   but it almost flips on its head,
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   the balancing of the desire to volunteer, which is here,
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:04.060]   but also wanting to possess one's time more carefully.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:09.180]   So I'll read the question.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.500]   It's pretty self-explanatory,
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.500]   but I wanted to frame it that the person
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.020]   is interested in volunteering,
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.900]   but values their time that's now their own,
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.660]   but is still interested in volunteering,
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.860]   how to navigate that conflict.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.380]   So again, I'll read it.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.660]   I worked long hours at my job and always expected
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.380]   I'd jump into volunteering when I retired.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.460]   I've been retired for six weeks,
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.140]   but haven't agreed to any volunteer work yet,
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.140]   even though I feel strongly about some causes.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.260]   Finally owning all my time has been intoxicating,
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:44.340]   and I feel miserly about donating any.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.780]   Looking for insights about how to volunteer
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.660]   without feeling resentful.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.180]   And again, Jill, I'll say roughly,
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.860]   we're gonna aim for turning it over to the group
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:55.100]   in about five minutes.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.580]   And we have three questions left
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.540]   that I think you have a lot to offer on.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.540]   So a brief answer for this would allow more coverage.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:07.900]   - This is a little hard brief,
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.300]   but I wanna congratulate that person.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.700]   The word intoxicating, that it is so great.
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   I find too many people say yes before they even retired.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.740]   They're on 20 million boards or they're doing this,
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.780]   their friends asking them, and then they regret it.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.860]   They're as busy as they were,
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.300]   and it's not even more meaningful.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300]   They just yes to everything.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.980]   So in some ways I think it's good to yes,
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:38.900]   but to take time and think and relish,
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.980]   to learn to reflect, to me, that's the essence.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.660]   It's a process.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.700]   So that you are enjoying this for now is great.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.620]   And I don't know if this person watched Brandon
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:52.900]   when you interviewed Brandon,
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.820]   but he was saying when you get involved in things,
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.900]   that was his name, right?
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.020]   Brandon. - Yeah, that's right.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:03.420]   - Try things that are low commitment, low cost.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.300]   And I thought those were good words.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:09.300]   So if you could try things where they say,
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.540]   you could just do this once a month,
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:17.540]   or you could try this to kind of transition in,
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:22.020]   and then you might find that's intoxicating or wow,
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.060]   now my mind is really fulfilled.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.380]   Anyway, if you could try things
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.540]   where they're willing to train you
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.060]   and you can take small commitments at a time,
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.540]   that's what I would encourage you to do, not jump in.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.740]   Okay, it's a year.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.500]   Maybe down the road you'll want that,
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.620]   but for now, learning about yourself
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.260]   and trying to figure this out,
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.780]   it's also more likely that you won't go back to work.
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.900]   And by the way, of people that do fully retire,
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:58.780]   30% of them go back after six years.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:01.780]   They don't know how to do other things.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.380]   And what I'm hearing is this person is saying,
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.660]   I'm enjoying it, what else?
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.420]   So think about what else,
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.780]   but I am not encouraging you to rush.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.300]   - Well, it's very practical.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.820]   It's very actionable.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.700]   Take bite-size approaches.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:24.580]   And that probably worked in a lot of people's
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.300]   day-to-day lives pre-retirement.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.460]   So it shouldn't be a foreign concept,
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.420]   I think, for a lot of people.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.180]   I mentioned, hold that thought earlier.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.780]   So I mentioned that because it ties
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.500]   into this next question perfectly.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.940]   When you were commenting on misalignment
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.660]   of someone's capacity or capability
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.420]   versus the role they're given
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.980]   at a not-for-profit or other volunteer role.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.420]   So this question is, what is the best way
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.020]   to match my skills and interests
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.500]   with a not-for-profit that can use them?
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:58.700]   - I feel like I need help from the audience.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.900]   What I can tell you from,
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.460]   there isn't a body of literature for that.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.180]   There's literature on the best way
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:12.180]   to use your time is by finding your highest skills
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.820]   and what you like doing
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.020]   so that you can go to your own strengths.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.580]   So I would say, do that,
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.580]   and then start talking to other people.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.820]   This is what I'm thinking.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.380]   I like, do you know about retirement?
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.900]   The people that have told me they had the best retirement,
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.420]   other people told them, oh, I am working here.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.580]   I've retired, and it's great.
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:36.660]   Or you could fumble like I did.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:37.860]   Try this, try that.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.540]   And then I have created my own retirement
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:44.860]   by starting the retirement research.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:49.060]   Then I created, I got convinced to do a website.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:49.900]   Put it out.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.220]   Don't just go scholarly.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.180]   Two people read your scholarly stuff.
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.020]   Put it general.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.060]   So I got a website and put my information
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.140]   because I wanted regular people to hear.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.540]   Well, then people start contacting me.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.020]   Oh, can you this?
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.740]   Would you that?
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.660]   So I didn't want to sell myself.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.900]   It unfolded, but I like reading
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.900]   so I can know I need to learn more about a topic
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:22.620]   and can involve my mind that way.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.420]   With the nonprofits,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:30.340]   I don't know if there's a list in your community of them.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:37.620]   There probably is a list,
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.380]   but it doesn't mean you're gonna get a good position.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:45.300]   - I think your suggestion of asking folks
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:49.180]   that you know who may know of groups or organizations
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.340]   or other people where they're content,
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.300]   it sounds like, you know how people say referrals
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.300]   are so much more effective
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.940]   or increase the probability of an appropriate match.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.620]   That sounds like a natural.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.900]   That suggestion of yours sounded great.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.100]   I'm gonna combine the next two questions, Jill,
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   and then just for folks to give a sense of timing,
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.780]   we'll take a break following Jill's response
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.340]   to these two questions,
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:21.620]   and then Carol will turn it over to Miriam and Alan
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.300]   for questions from the chat.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.820]   So that whole piece may take say five minutes or so
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.180]   if that works for folks.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.780]   So Jill, the last two questions,
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.460]   and again, I'm combining them,
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:38.100]   seem to me a great summary
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.580]   of a lot of what you've been talking about
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:44.340]   and kind of culminates a lot of people's interest
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.940]   in what to do with all this information.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.140]   So I'll read the questions as they're presented.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.540]   From your experience with patients,
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.980]   what things in a retired person's life
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.980]   tend to bring the most happiness?
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.380]   That's question one.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.820]   And then two, I think we hear this a lot.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.660]   People are kind of at a loss
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.780]   in a way to answer this when asked,
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.180]   but how do you spend your day?
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.820]   I retired three weeks ago
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.580]   and would love to know how others spend time
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.020]   during retirement.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:14.940]   So those are the last two.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.700]   Jill, I wanna thank you for your time and insights
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.300]   and just sharing everything you do, your expertise
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.420]   and how well you share it so approachably and personably.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.860]   So back to you.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.060]   - Do you want me, in terms of spending a day,
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.980]   how I spend a day,
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.980]   or are we gonna open it to the audience?
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.060]   How do people spend a day?
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.300]   - Let's start with you,
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.220]   but not necessarily you personally,
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:42.300]   in your research and interviews,
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.820]   how do people spend their day?
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.460]   I think it might get chaotic
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.420]   if we turn it over to the audience.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.460]   - Well, at some point I'd like that chaos
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:55.180]   because then you're gonna learn from each other what to do.
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.260]   But the happiness, I think,
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:02.660]   just to review,
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.380]   the theory says by being with other people,
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:10.300]   by exercising, having purpose,
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:15.300]   and connections, also internet connections
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.020]   because you wanna stay digitally attached
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.460]   or you can learn older people that are attached
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.220]   or that use the internet are happier
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.460]   because of what we do with it.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:37.540]   Keep reflecting, take time to think.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.420]   I haven't done this before.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.780]   What's working, what's not?
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.300]   Or if you don't even know how to reflect,
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.260]   which many people don't, what's she talking about?
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.300]   Ask me or ask someone else.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   How have you figured this out?
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:53.580]   And in terms of how people spend a day,
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.980]   it hasn't been my research or in the research typical,
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:02.980]   but as Arthur said, he does not like feeling adrift.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:08.700]   And many of us have had such scheduled lives
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:13.700]   that I would say some degree of schedule is a good thing.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.380]   Flexibility is good.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.420]   So you might not be like me.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.380]   I like to know I'm gonna be taking a class
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.460]   or I like to know waking up and going to the beach
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.300]   for a walk.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.140]   I like to exercise, walk right away and see the ocean.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.620]   I didn't grow up by the ocean.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.980]   It's amazing.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.900]   And when I worked, I just...
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.180]   So I know the things that matter to me.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:40.180]   So I have a semi-structured life that changes
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.220]   and the people that I see that do best,
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.020]   even if they say they don't want structure,
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:49.580]   they are picking times to meet their friends
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.060]   or picking time to whatever it is,
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.100]   to go to the gym, to this and that.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.540]   And of course things got messed up during COVID,
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:00.860]   but I think it is not a bad idea
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.180]   to have some degree of schedule.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.860]   And of course we have the luxury of flexibility.
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.060]   You don't like it, you can change it.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.980]   But most people don't like waking up to,
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.460]   oh no, what am I gonna do?
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.820]   It's oppressive.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.420]   It's not, okay, in the beginning it's intoxicating,
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.580]   but then it's like, what about today?
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.900]   So if you know you like seeing your friends once a week,
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.740]   don't wait till they're too busy or once or whatever.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.300]   Try and try these things out.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.060]   Maybe you never saw your friends once a week.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.940]   Well, maybe you try something
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.780]   or you say, can we exercise together?
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.180]   Then you're doing two things at once.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.580]   You're walking and you're...
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:48.140]   That's, you know, the other, the bad thing is,
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.740]   well, first of all, usually people
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.820]   in the beginning of retirement, travel goes up.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.540]   You've waited for travel and you're gonna see
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.260]   there's a word like you're, you get tired.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.460]   Well, I forget that word,
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.940]   but you get tired of these things if you do it too much.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.020]   If you eat out too much, if you travel too much,
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.500]   all of a sudden it's like, eh, that's what you're doing.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.820]   You don't wanna do too much of it.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.660]   But people like traveling.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.540]   And of course, like with COVID, you can't.
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.420]   Well, you can or you can't, I'm not.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.620]   But that's usually in the beginning of retirement.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.180]   That goes way up and spending on it.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:36.180]   And what makes people happy in terms of spending is leisure.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.460]   If you spend it on your leisure,
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:41.820]   whether it's walking somewhere or doing something,
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.980]   having an adventure, that kind of thing,
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.660]   and being with people.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.860]   Those two things together make it more likely.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:52.460]   So I would suggest figure out a way
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:56.180]   to have people in your life and in your day,
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:01.180]   like Leslie picked elements of exercise, of creativity,
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:06.300]   of giving back to others, maybe time for gratitude.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:10.500]   Any of these things, maybe you wanted to meditate.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.740]   If they sound good, maybe you'll gear it towards planned,
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.700]   or maybe you'll say these things are things
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.060]   I wish I would have done.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.980]   I'm gonna start trying them out.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.580]   - Excellent.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.940]   That is invaluable advice.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.500]   And we thank you and Jill,
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.340]   the way you said having people in your life,
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.260]   we're grateful to have you in the lives
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.780]   of the Boglehead community.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.420]   I'll just, I wanna address your comment
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:37.260]   about enjoying the chaos of having,
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.780]   hearing from the community and how they spend their day.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   So we can try to organize a separate call
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.580]   where there's more of an open forum,
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.140]   participatory and interactive for people to do exactly that
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.180]   for how they spend their days in retirement.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:57.260]   So we can try to develop that idea.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.100]   With that, Jill, I wanna thank you again.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.980]   If you wanna take a quick break, feel free,
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.740]   and I will turn it over to Carol
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:09.420]   for a recap of the rest of this meeting.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.620]   And thanks to all for making this happen.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:13.340]   - Okay, I'll be right back, thanks.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.980]   - Thank you very much, Jill.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.460]   Right, first I'm gonna turn off.
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.740]   Go ahead, you can take a break.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.860]   I'm gonna turn off the spotlight view.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:26.380]   And then if the audience wants to get your gallery view back
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.900]   where you see little squares for everybody,
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.700]   just click on view in the upper right-hand corner
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.020]   and click on gallery, and you'll get your gallery view back.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:38.900]   So while we're taking a little break,
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.900]   I'm gonna talk about feedback.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.020]   Just in general, the Boglehead's Life Stages groups,
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.060]   we would love to get your feedback
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.060]   on either specific things on this presentation
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.540]   as far as the format and the content,
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.940]   or just in general, what types of topics
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.700]   would you like to see as meetings in the future?
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:04.420]   Feel free to give any kind of critical,
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.500]   we don't want just positive feedback.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:10.460]   We would appreciate either just candid feedback
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.060]   about, like I said, the content or the format
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.260]   of either this presentation or some past ones
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.420]   or what you'd like to see in the future.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.620]   And the way you can do that,
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.180]   you can go ahead and put it right in the chat.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:25.300]   As we said, after we save the chat,
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.420]   we're gonna remove the name,
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.460]   so your names won't be part of the record.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:34.140]   I'm gonna post a little link in the chat,
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:38.140]   and this is the link to what we call the master thread
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:42.980]   for the pre-retirement, early retirement group,
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:45.140]   which is one of the groups that hosted this meeting.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.180]   If you go to that master thread,
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:51.180]   the first person that posted that, who's me,
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:52.980]   it's DFW Bogleheads,
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.020]   you can send a private Bogleheads message,
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.180]   I think they call them PMs,
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.260]   to give that feedback if we'd rather do it privately.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:05.020]   So that's a couple of ways that you can give us feedback.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.540]   Let's see.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.980]   And I guess we can, we're still recording.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.540]   I guess, Jim, should we just keep recording
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.900]   until the point where we have a raised hand person,
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.340]   and then we'll stop at that point?
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.260]   Or we can stop right now, either way.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.100]   - We can keep going.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.180]   Some people have commented
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:24.060]   they like the questions on the video.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.340]   - Okay, so let's, we can keep it,
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.180]   but as soon as we have a person that has the raised hand,
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.300]   at that point, we start taking raised hand questions,
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.660]   then we'll stop.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.220]   - I agree.
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:36.780]   - Okay, okay.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.780]   So let me go ahead and go over a little bit
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.020]   about the format of what we're gonna do for the questions.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.500]   We do have a list of not all of the questions.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.580]   We did cover maybe about half of the questions
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.540]   that were entered pre-submitted through the RSVP forms
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.180]   were directly asked through the interview process.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.860]   We do have quite a few of those left
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.700]   that we could ask of Jill.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.900]   And then also, there weren't very many.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:05.900]   There were just a couple questions asked in the chat window.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.980]   Let's see, what else?
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.580]   Oh, and then thirdly, you're very welcome
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.260]   to do your Zoom raised hand,
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.780]   and everybody knows how to do that.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.100]   At the very bottom of your screen,
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:16.980]   there's a little raised hand.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.380]   I can just click on that.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.100]   And then I will call on you
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.860]   in the order that you raised your hand,
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.980]   and you could appear on camera and ask Jill the questions.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.580]   So feel free to go ahead and do that
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.300]   while we're gearing up our questions.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:36.220]   Miriam, were there any questions in the chat?
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.940]   - Yes, there were.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.900]   There were a few.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.940]   And by the way, Jill, that was a wonderful presentation.
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:45.900]   It was absolutely delightful to listen to you.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.820]   And in the chat, everybody said,
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.500]   "Just keep going, keep going."
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:55.460]   - Can I just say two things before more questions come?
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.780]   Would that be okay with you?
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.700]   - Yes, yes.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.060]   - First of all, maybe people are gonna leave,
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.660]   and I wanna make sure they know
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.940]   that you're gonna give them my email.
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:11.940]   So if they have questions, that they can contact me.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.580]   And the other thing, when I was saying,
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.620]   I like the idea of chaos so we can learn from each other.
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.220]   That's not exactly true.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.220]   When I do classes or seminars on Zoom,
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.900]   I think 10 to 12 people are best.
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:28.220]   So if we wanna pilot anything
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.060]   where people wanna talk among themselves
[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.860]   and ask these real questions of each other
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:37.060]   and have me facilitate it and give them prep work
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.740]   like TED Talks or reading,
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.700]   I think they should do to prepare.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:45.340]   I would rather it be like that
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.620]   'cause you'll learn more from each other.
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:48.460]   Okay, thanks.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.500]   Your turn.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.380]   Thank you for humoring me.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.300]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:59.500]   One question is, how well do people who never retire,
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:04.980]   who work until the end intentionally,
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.460]   how, I believe the question was for intentionally,
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.500]   they do not retire, they keep working.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.300]   How well do they do?
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:19.940]   - I have to look it up.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:23.300]   I don't know the literature except that I know
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.500]   that more and more people continue to work.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:32.180]   So some people continue to work because they love their work.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:36.140]   Some people continue to work because they need the money.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.540]   And some people don't know what else to do.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.420]   They can't find purpose.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.780]   So they go back to work because they're pretty miserable
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:47.100]   and can't find their time.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:52.100]   So I don't have, could that person say more
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.980]   like what their concerns are about,
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:59.540]   like, do they wanna just keep working
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.220]   and they think they shouldn't?
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:04.620]   Or what will they miss out on?
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.900]   Can they give me some more dimensions to this question?
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:11.820]   I don't have a research answer.
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.900]   - Yes, we'll wait and see if they enter
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.420]   any more information into the chat.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:20.620]   At that time, we can revisit the question.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.340]   Alan, were there any more in the chat?
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.580]   - I have one myself.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.340]   I'm curious, we know that Scandinavian countries
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:30.660]   and citizens tend to have the highest happiness quotient.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.580]   Is that the same for their retirees?
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.340]   Those countries that have a more robust social system
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.060]   and support, are their retirees more successful
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.780]   and happier as well when they're out of the workforce?
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:46.740]   - Oh boy, I think I once knew this.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:51.100]   And I should note from the COVID literature
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.300]   because there's this world happiness report
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.620]   that comes out every year.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.140]   It's like a hundred pages long.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:01.820]   And this one was on the 2021.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:05.020]   So it was during COVID and people in certain countries
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.580]   were doing better.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.940]   So I wish I knew the answer and I don't.
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:14.860]   I would guess, yes, because of the social services
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:19.620]   and the way people value each other and the time.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:22.900]   So I would guess, yes, I don't have a good answer.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:29.860]   - There's another one, Miriam from Ed.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.740]   - Is there another one?
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.580]   - No.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:38.580]   - One question is on moving and downsizing when you retire.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:45.460]   And you mentioned about space being a really big thing.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:51.060]   And what have you read about moving and downsizing
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:57.660]   to small spaces after you've had larger homes
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.940]   and you've raised your families and everything.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.420]   What is going on when they retire
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:09.340]   and then they immediately move and they downsize
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.660]   and how does it affect them
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.900]   in the rest of their retirement?
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:18.500]   - Wow, another really good question.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.140]   And it's not in the literature
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.380]   because I try to review everything,
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.100]   but I will tell you what I know
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.380]   from the people I've interviewed.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.220]   From the people I've interviewed, they say,
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.060]   if you're gonna move somewhere,
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.940]   a lot of people move to be near their children
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:33.940]   or the warm weather
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.660]   or something they're interested in science.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:38.380]   So a lot of people come to Santa Cruz,
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.860]   now they can, we're big on sciences here.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:46.860]   They recommend go somewhere and rent first
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:51.060]   because you don't know if you're gonna like that area.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.900]   You don't know within an area
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.100]   where you're gonna wanna be.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.860]   So if you could possibly keep your home
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:04.140]   while you do this or experiment that way,
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.300]   the people that did that told me
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.540]   it worked better than their friends.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.260]   Their friends got stuck.
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.620]   They thought they were gonna like it.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.740]   It's like you take a job,
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.420]   you don't know for X amount of time
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.620]   are you gonna like the people you work with and stuff.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:22.300]   So I would say, again, the more research you do about it
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.380]   and whether people are happy or not,
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.860]   people are doing it, they downsize.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.740]   Their houses become oppressive.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:35.660]   It becomes too hard in where I live in Santa Cruz.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:38.780]   First of all, housing, I grew up really poor.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:42.220]   So it's amazing that I ever retired, let alone here,
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:43.540]   but I grew up poor.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.460]   I learned to do what you all are doing on my own
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:51.460]   and I'm a female and I'm 71, but in Santa Cruz now.
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.660]   So the area around here,
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.660]   it's very hard to get a house that's one story.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:02.500]   People are moving, wanna move here
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.860]   and they can't buy one stories.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:09.700]   It's way more money because we need one stories
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.300]   maybe eventually rather than two stories.
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.900]   'Cause at some point, maybe you can't do steps.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:19.980]   So why buy something that big with steps
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:23.140]   if eventually it might not work for you?
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.140]   So that's a great question.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:30.140]   And I don't know, but people do it.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.740]   Not everybody, but my experience is
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:36.660]   many of the people I interviewed do it.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.300]   And I'll tell you, there's something in Santa Cruz
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:42.820]   that I had a terrible bias and I was very wrong.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:45.900]   We have a lot of mobile home parks
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.220]   and I guess I only knew about them from movies or something
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:52.180]   that they were funky, they're not.
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:56.260]   They, I see mobile home parks here that are absolutely
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.140]   lovely and can be supportive and can be safe.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:05.140]   So I would say as much as you can question your thinking,
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.420]   be open, but I don't have a,
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.780]   you're giving me things to go research.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.620]   Thank you.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:17.220]   - Alan, did you have any other questions from the chat?
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.780]   - Yes, there's one actually from Jim, I believe.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:23.660]   Any evidence that the over 55 communities
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:25.820]   have a better retirement experience?
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:32.420]   - I read this stuff and I don't have an answer.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.700]   I mean, I don't have a research answer.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.620]   I know people that I know,
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.100]   like I even started a COVID connection group,
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.660]   a connection community because the University of Michigan
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.060]   got me to do that during COVID.
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.540]   They hired me to start working with faculty.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.740]   You know how one day you're in the classroom
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.460]   and the next day nobody's there 'cause of COVID.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.460]   They hired me to start working with faculty and staff
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.140]   and the ZAs, the TAs.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:04.380]   But anyway, so I did one for my community here.
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:08.180]   I figured I owed it to my community and it's been profound.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.220]   It was supposed to be three sessions
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.340]   and now they won't stop.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.020]   So we've continued.
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:19.020]   Some of them live in those over 55s and didn't used to
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.220]   and they love it.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.020]   They feel safe.
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:26.060]   And having a good environment is also a predictor
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.460]   of how healthy you're gonna be and enjoy your life.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.980]   If you have an environment where,
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:35.580]   they use this one dumb test where, this is one test.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:38.180]   If you thought you lost your wallet
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:40.700]   and somebody is gonna return it to you,
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.820]   do you feel safe in your environment?
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:48.340]   But anyway, I live in a place where you can walk safely.
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.460]   It's by the ocean.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.300]   It's lovely.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:53.100]   Environment affects how you feel.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.020]   You can tell by people's zip code and stuff.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:01.020]   So the over 50s that I've heard experience from feel safe
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:05.180]   and it's quiet.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.940]   That's very different than the people during COVID
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.780]   that weren't assisted living.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:12.660]   That was one of the worst experience for everybody
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.900]   in the lockdown.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:16.300]   If you look at the data and depression,
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:21.500]   it's been very rough for people in those kinds of situations
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.260]   even though before they liked it.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.940]   During COVID, it's been much harder.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.140]   - Let me throw in.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.060]   I just had dinner this evening with friends of ours,
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:34.180]   longtime friends that just moved from our area
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:38.180]   to a 55 plus community about six months ago
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.020]   and they've never been happier.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:42.420]   Much more involved and doing new activities
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.420]   that they never thought they would be doing
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.580]   and they absolutely love it.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.060]   - And for the person that was asking about friendship
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:51.700]   or a widow, there are a community of people
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:55.700]   that with activities, you can maybe get to know
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.820]   and you can feel safer.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.740]   When people are older, depending on the people,
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.140]   different things happen.
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:07.380]   - I'm sorry, after you, Carol.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.780]   - Oh, I was just gonna remind the audience
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.620]   that you're welcome to use the,
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.060]   if you wanna ask a question,
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.700]   if you don't mind asking a question on camera,
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.540]   you can raise your hand.
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:17.540]   Otherwise, we'll continue.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.740]   I do have a few questions I wanna ask
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.180]   from the, that were originally submitted with the RSVP
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.620]   but we are gonna prioritize at this point
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.260]   any raised hand questions.
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:27.980]   But go ahead, Gary, what we can say.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:29.500]   - So thanks, Carol.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:32.220]   Three things, one point, Jill,
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.740]   since you were asking for real-time feedback,
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.300]   throughout the chat, people are saying
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:40.060]   they appreciate the non-financial content of this meeting.
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.420]   So it's definitely welcome.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:45.020]   And we've spoken about having a subsequent meeting with you
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:49.300]   if you're agreeable, and not just the highly interactive,
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.780]   you know, how people spend their time,
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:53.900]   but where you can talk about additional things
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.180]   that weren't covered here.
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.020]   So that's one.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:59.500]   Two remaining, one is a question that I'll ask you
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.740]   and I wanted to cover.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.660]   Ed has a question in the chat.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:05.140]   How do you contend with a sudden change
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.980]   in your retirement plans,
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.540]   like parents who are suffering from dementia?
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:10.380]   So that's one.
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:13.300]   And then my own question, Jill, if you wouldn't mind,
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:17.700]   you mentioned growing up, your childhood,
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.620]   you know, you commented on your childhood.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:22.700]   If you're comfortable, to what extent you can share
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.540]   how was growing up with your family,
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.420]   your journey to where you are now,
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.860]   what led you to do your research
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:31.180]   and how you came to specialize
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.260]   on this topic that you're sharing?
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.100]   - Okay.
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.820]   My childhood, if we talk about,
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.780]   I had a difficult childhood.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.860]   So with my nuclear family was difficult emotionally
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.500]   if somebody wants to know about that.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.100]   But what I think is important for this is
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:55.500]   I grew up poor.
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:59.700]   My parents graduated eighth grade and 12th grade.
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:04.620]   How I knew to go to get a PhD and pursue my career,
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.420]   I studied that.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.580]   That became my dissertation.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:11.620]   What made it more likely
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.100]   that women could make it as professionals.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:16.980]   When I have questions, I study.
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:20.820]   And I think growing up poor,
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.500]   one of the things in the literature
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.260]   was people that had more employment experiences
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:29.860]   when they were young tended for women
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.980]   to be professionals more so.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:35.620]   And there were a lot of other factors,
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.300]   but my childhood, my dad died when I was 10.
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:41.580]   My dad was a gambler, blah, blah, these hard things.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:45.300]   I had to earn money.
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.940]   So from eight or 10,
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.900]   I was earning money from babysitting to other things
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.380]   and then taking care of my mom and stuff.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.940]   So that helped me see I'm going to be working.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:01.100]   I want to figure out how can I work
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:04.380]   in a way that I'm going to enjoy my life and get meaning.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.860]   So it wasn't always the best at happy.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.900]   I could read about happy while other people did it,
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:12.340]   but somehow I'm good at meaningful
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.180]   and figuring out what would work.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:17.980]   But also I was a woman, a girl,
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:23.940]   and I had to learn about investing myself.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:26.940]   I didn't have a family that was going to tell,
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:30.540]   my nuclear family wasn't good at it.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.620]   And I'm a very persistent person.
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:37.660]   And I learn and I ask other people and I find out,
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.820]   oh, you're doing it well.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:40.900]   What have you invested?
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.260]   Then I read and I study.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:47.460]   So I managed to go from nothing,
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:51.460]   taking care of my mother to I am retired in California.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.020]   And that is one of the things that correlates
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.380]   with people being happier,
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:58.860]   even though I don't usually talk about the financial part.
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.220]   I have a pension.
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.140]   I think that's the appropriate word
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:05.820]   from working the university for 30 years.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:09.060]   I get money every month.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:14.060]   That security feeling in control adds to happiness,
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.060]   but it's a dinosaur.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.180]   Many people don't have that anymore.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.980]   But I was a big saver.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:26.420]   I worked maybe too hard, maybe not 'cause I'm here,
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:30.580]   but I did all the diverse, I bought other properties.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.140]   I did rental as well as I worked at the university
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:36.300]   and I had a private practice.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.900]   I worked too much or did I?
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.220]   I don't know, I'm here now.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:43.340]   I retired at 57, I'm 71.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:47.060]   But that tells you a little bit about my childhood.
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:50.340]   And the dementia thing just makes me kind of sick.
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:53.900]   I've had it in my family.
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.340]   I took care of my brother from afar.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.620]   If anyone ever needs to know about this,
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.900]   I hope you don't, but I even had to deal
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.700]   with getting him a guardian, a legal guardian
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.220]   and going to lawyers,
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.380]   a person that had never been to lawyers.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.100]   It's another state.
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:17.780]   It was so not fun, but I feel like I gifted my brother.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.900]   He got to stay in his home.
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.940]   And if I wouldn't have fought the courts,
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.980]   he lost his executive functioning, but didn't know it.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.220]   He was very good at finances.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.900]   He never would have bounced a check
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:34.820]   and all of a sudden he's not paying his mortgage and stuff.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.540]   So I stepped in and it was very hard.
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:38.420]   I'm living afar.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:42.060]   I had no experience with this and I had to do it.
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:43.380]   I just had to.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.620]   And if you need to learn about that,
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:49.100]   ask me before you have to get into that situation
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.380]   'cause so many people take advantage of old people
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:55.260]   or they would have taken all his money
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.380]   and put him in a home.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.540]   Anyway, this stuff about dementia.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:03.980]   So I'm 71 and all my friends and I,
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:07.020]   our memories aren't that good.
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.500]   And then you go, is this my memory isn't that good
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.780]   or my memory isn't that good.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:13.980]   So we're reading, we're learning.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:17.660]   And I'm gonna say something incredibly heavy,
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.220]   but real that I wish people would think about.
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:22.220]   Think about,
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.420]   it's your life.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.340]   How do you want to end it?
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:32.420]   And what I'm saying is like in that group that I told you,
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.740]   there were seven women ages 60 to 87
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.420]   through this COVID experience.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.940]   One person during COVID got cancer,
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.380]   had all the best treatments at Stanford and nothing worked.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:50.900]   And she had a great relationship with her husband
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:54.740]   and her doctors and hospice and chose in my state,
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.380]   you can choose to end your life
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:02.860]   if you have six months less than six months to live.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:07.860]   And if you can take the potion yourself,
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:11.420]   somebody gets it for you, but you have to be sound of mind.
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:14.300]   That's a lot of criteria to be able
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.580]   if you want to end your life.
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.860]   And I right now, I'm very upset that
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:22.620]   if I were to get dementia, I don't have that option.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.700]   Now, this might be too hard for people,
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:25.940]   but it's reality.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:28.100]   You want to be thinking about these things
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:29.860]   and letting your family know.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:34.140]   So I'm actually considering starting to work on the law,
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.060]   which is something else I've never done,
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:38.020]   but it would be a fight for us
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.060]   because if you have dementia,
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:45.060]   it's not considered in the law that you can deal with it
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.220]   because I wouldn't be sound of mind.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.740]   It's not six months, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.740]   So all I can say to this person,
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:56.740]   asking about dementia is just a very hard, difficult thing.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.900]   This might make you feel better.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.340]   Hopefully you're in this category.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.700]   With dementia, people that are more educated
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.900]   are less likely to get dementia.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.500]   And it runs in families.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:14.220]   Meaning if your mother luckily was above eighth grade,
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:15.420]   you're in good shape.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:17.500]   If she was below eighth grade,
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.980]   you're more likely to get dementia.
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:22.900]   And the recent studies are more likely,
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.940]   it's how well you did.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:27.220]   It doesn't matter how much you did,
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:28.580]   how much schooling you did.
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:30.220]   Now they're saying it's quality.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.740]   If you studied hard and did well,
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.780]   you're less likely to get dementia.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.980]   So hopefully that's a little comforting.
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.020]   - It is comforting, Jill.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:39.940]   Thanks for sharing that.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.140]   I want to build on Ed's question a bit more
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:44.500]   and some of what you just said.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.900]   In terms of say genetics or your parents,
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.100]   things that are well beyond our control,
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.020]   we have little influence there,
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:52.460]   but there's so much written about
[01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:55.940]   and because you exhaustively digest the studies,
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:57.100]   as you've said,
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.980]   what have you found to be commonality
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.060]   supported by the science to avert dementia
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.180]   or delay dementia?
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:07.180]   People talk about puzzles or their websites
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.460]   selling brain teasers, all these things.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.220]   But I don't know that the science supports that,
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:16.220]   but I seem to see exercise as a recurring activity
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.140]   that it helps the brain,
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:22.620]   but I don't know what the science says more deeply
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:23.460]   or broadly.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.300]   Maybe you can comment on that.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.220]   - Let me look and see if I know anything more
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.260]   because I do have a section on it
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:31.420]   and these games and stuff,
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:34.420]   there's no literature backing it up.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:38.500]   Like people that even New York Times puzzles,
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.420]   they like it.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.260]   That's great.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.380]   You like it, do it.
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:45.220]   But it doesn't stave off necessarily dementia.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:48.220]   But what you said about exercise,
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:51.660]   that's a huge literature for mental health,
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.420]   for physical health, for longevity.
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:57.700]   The literature would say, don't smoke,
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.460]   don't drink excessively.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:00.620]   Yeah, you can drink, okay,
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.580]   but you know, maybe you don't know,
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:06.180]   but you don't want to have a problem with these things.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:10.380]   But the other really hard thing about dementia
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.460]   is you go to doctors
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:15.100]   and they start prescribing all these medications
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.100]   for you.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.460]   First of all, medications are usually tested in isolation.
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.260]   They're not tested with other drugs.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.460]   So they're not necessarily...
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:25.740]   And I know literature,
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:28.220]   like if you need an antidepressant
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:31.100]   and it's a really good one, that's great.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:32.380]   And it can help.
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:36.220]   I'm much more into cognitive exercise.
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:38.700]   There's so many things you could do for depression
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:43.260]   before most people do not need to take an antidepressant.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:46.620]   But these medications have side effects
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.260]   like some of the antidepressants
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.500]   that make it more likely
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.700]   you're going to have memory problems.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:57.060]   So read about the medications you're going to take.
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.300]   Don't just take them because maybe it'll help one thing,
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.820]   but the side effects can be big.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:06.180]   So I don't have a lot of literature.
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:10.420]   It's not my area of expertise, neurocognitive.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.340]   I just know some of it
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:16.340]   because that's the question people ask.
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:19.860]   And we tend to use the word neurocognitive now,
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:20.860]   not just dementia,
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:25.500]   because there are a lot of ways you can lose your memory.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:29.300]   So let me, I don't think I have much more to say.
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:32.620]   - I'm sorry, our time's running a little short.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:33.700]   We're going to move on.
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.740]   Alan has a question.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.380]   Lady Geek, we're going to call on you in just a second.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.100]   I want to remind people, see what Lady Geek did.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.700]   You don't have to turn your video on necessarily
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.540]   to ask a question.
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:44.620]   Of course, you do have to turn your audio on.
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:48.220]   So don't be shy about asking a question with your raised hand.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.380]   Alan, you go ahead and read the question in the chat,
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:52.460]   and then we'll take Lady Geek's question.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.220]   - All righty.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.540]   Tom had a question, a very good one.
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:57.140]   Of the people you've interviewed,
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:00.020]   did you identify good strategies for introverts
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:01.580]   in adapting to retirement?
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:07.180]   - Oh, I think-
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.260]   I'm thinking, it's a good one.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.020]   And I want to tell you, I'm an introvert.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:15.300]   So it's a funny thing.
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:20.300]   I'm an introvert, but I do need my one-on-ones and more.
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:23.780]   So that's, there's not a whole literature on it.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:26.380]   I just want to tell those introverts,
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:31.460]   if you can find purpose and you can connect with people,
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:35.660]   at least sometimes, it's really important.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:39.140]   And during COVID, the over 60s
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:42.260]   that had the social connections
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:45.380]   and then had people they could rely on,
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:47.180]   they did much better.
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:52.180]   So, gee, I'll have to think more about it
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.380]   because most people, I think,
[01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:58.860]   from the little literature I know about introverts,
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.140]   and I've read a bunch,
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.420]   we're not, it's not so black and white.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.260]   We're on a continuum.
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.860]   So if there is a way you can find
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.580]   to connect with other people,
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:12.660]   maybe you like reading and they like reading.
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:16.900]   It is, the literature is clear about other people.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:19.420]   And if you still want to just be an introvert
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:20.860]   and not relate to other people,
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:23.060]   can you at least get a pet?
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:26.340]   But I don't have the body of literature
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.580]   and I'd look it up for you.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.060]   There's something that I want to tell you
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:32.900]   that I didn't make concrete,
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:36.100]   but Rory asked me that with the gratitude,
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:38.460]   there really is a big literature on gratitude.
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:40.300]   And usually they say, when you go to bed,
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.580]   it's better to think about
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.660]   maybe three things you're grateful for
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.420]   rather than the things that didn't work well today.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.220]   We tend to think of that.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:51.700]   One time when I was in a really bad place in my life,
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:55.020]   I put myself on a, I made up a gratitude diet.
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.940]   So every time during the day
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.980]   that my mind was going to that funky stuff,
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:03.340]   I tried to remember things I'm grateful for.
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:04.820]   And I am a grateful person,
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.380]   but when you get in that funk, it's hard to remember.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:10.220]   Anyway, I would like to read more
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:12.700]   to see if I can tell more to the introverts,
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:17.540]   but I do believe there are ways they can be around people.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.700]   I would ask that person right now,
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.940]   have you ever enjoyed being around people?
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.180]   Is there anything you can do?
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:28.180]   Because as an introvert, I need a lot of recovery time,
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:31.700]   but that doesn't mean I don't need social time.
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:35.980]   I need it, but then I can't go back to back to back.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:38.340]   And like this to me as an introvert,
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.260]   I have a structured role.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:43.740]   It's not as hard as being chatty.
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.940]   That's very hard for me.
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:50.940]   So I don't know, any introverts, do you have any help?
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:57.220]   - Okay, thank you for that answer.
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:58.980]   I'm gonna go ahead and take a Lady Geek's question.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.700]   We have about five more minutes left for questions.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.740]   Then we're gonna save about five minutes to wrap up.
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:04.420]   Go ahead, Lady Geek, ask your question.
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.660]   - Let me get back to Ed's dementia first.
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.420]   My late husband had dementia
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:13.180]   as a result of a very stressful medical condition
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:15.700]   and the advice you've given I've heard,
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.500]   based on my experience,
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:21.420]   I would say to discount that advice on the causes,
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:24.820]   root causes of dementia and treatments with medications,
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:29.420]   please, instead, go see, in fact, my late husband,
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:32.020]   I was dealing with the Hospital University of Pennsylvania
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.580]   top in the country on neurological things.
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:39.260]   My real-time experience, just see the physician,
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:42.140]   do not take advice on the internet on this.
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:47.140]   Serious meds, so please, that's why I raised my hand.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:52.460]   Please, you are giving general advice, which is perfect,
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.780]   but not for dementia, please,
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.860]   just based on personal experience.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.740]   See a physician and an expert
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:03.700]   in the neurological condition that, and it's long-term,
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:07.140]   you don't play with meds for psychological things.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:08.380]   You don't play with that.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:13.300]   So, but anyway, so let me get back with that.
[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:14.380]   I'm getting frustrated.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:15.540]   If I had my video on,
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:18.420]   I'd be like waving my hands and flagging things.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:21.940]   So, but anyway, I think what Ed is getting at
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:23.780]   is retirement plans.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:26.340]   Yes, life sucks.
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.780]   Plans change.
[01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:30.620]   Your parents, I'm dealing with another parent
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:32.660]   with a cognitive decline.
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.700]   It's getting very frustrating.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:36.460]   You just have to roll with it
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.340]   and you have to make a decision.
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.540]   Can you afford them?
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:44.860]   And parents in dementia or somebody with dementia,
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:46.540]   are they safe to be at home?
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:50.100]   You go through this basic criteria with a social worker
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:55.060]   or somebody who, you cannot take care of them at home.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:58.620]   If they get physically incapacitated,
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.100]   you cannot do this at home.
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:01.980]   And you just have to, you just deal with it.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:03.940]   Life change, life is not fair.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.020]   That's, I'm a widow.
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.820]   I'm also living alone.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:11.460]   And your advice on this, being solo is fantastic.
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:14.780]   I'm also a professional engineer.
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:17.740]   So, I'm independent, very independent.
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:22.700]   So, I just want to say for retirement,
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:26.940]   if you plan what plans on paper, financial wise,
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:29.380]   oh, we can swing with mom and dad living at home.
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:31.860]   The emotional impact will be,
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.660]   it'll just roll you right over.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.980]   So, I say life is not fair.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.820]   Plan for it.
[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:39.340]   And the best you can do is plan for it
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.260]   and then make a ton of different alternatives,
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.740]   talk and deal with that.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:43.780]   So, that's what I wanted to say,
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:44.940]   but it's mainly the medical thing
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:46.740]   that kind of hit me strong.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:49.860]   That I say, sorry, you're an expert,
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.500]   but I do disagree on giving advice.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:55.700]   - And I'm not sure what you disagree with,
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.620]   'cause I agree with what you're saying.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:58.460]   You've got to-
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:00.100]   - Yeah, I say you're giving general advice.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.540]   And I'm also the administrator on the forum.
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:04.460]   And I see a lot of people,
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:07.100]   they take your advice out of context.
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:11.260]   You're addressing a single person answer, which is great,
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:15.180]   but you have close to 100 people on this recording
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.460]   who are listening to that and may misunderstand
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.300]   or misinterpret.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.780]   "Oh, Jill said we should give you depression meds."
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.100]   No, no, no, no, that's...
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.540]   Yeah, so I want to make sure that people are clear
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.700]   that this is good advice,
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:31.700]   but do not act until you consult
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:35.300]   with the people involved, with a physician.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.140]   - What I was trying to say,
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:39.420]   if a physician wants to give you,
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:41.660]   for example, depression drugs,
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:44.180]   read about it and be very informed,
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.140]   just like you are with your finances.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.900]   These drugs have side effects.
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.580]   So I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:53.900]   I'm trying to say be as informed with your health
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.300]   as you are with your finances.
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:57.980]   - Thank you.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:59.460]   Okay, can we move on?
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:00.740]   We want to take one last question.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.700]   We're going to let Henry ask his question,
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:05.420]   then we're going to have to, it's time to wrap up.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:08.060]   - Yeah, I want to pick up on what Lady Geek just said,
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:12.580]   that I'm about 10 years into retirement
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:17.580]   and it's hard to avoid what's called presentism,
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:22.540]   where you are sort of stuck where you are at the moment
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.380]   and you make, as you make your projections for the future.
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:28.980]   And that's true for financial items,
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:30.420]   but it's also true for health.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:35.260]   It's also true for how your life is going to play out.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:39.300]   And so to the extent you can build in
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.660]   a decent amount of flexibility,
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:44.140]   and it's not just financial flexibility,
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:49.140]   it's also lifestyle, it's hard to project.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:52.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:55.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:58.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:03.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:06.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:11.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.300]   (upbeat music)
