[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   At Weights & Biases, we make developer tools for deep learning.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.200]   We want to make it easier to track your experiments, improve your models, and share your findings.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   Before we started using Weights & Biases, everybody had their own little setup of how they would get their results.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.800]   Some people would be using their own homebrew version of some visualization tool.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.600]   Everything was very fragile.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.400]   If I wanted to share a piece of results with somebody else, the best I could usually hope for was a screenshot of my graph,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.200]   and then paste it and send it to them over Slack or over email.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.800]   Add just a few lines to your training script to get started, no matter what framework or infrastructure you're using.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   You'll see the loss and accuracy of your models in real time,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.200]   and we'll try to make it easy to reproduce this run by saving your hyperparameters,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.000]   performance metrics, terminal log, output file, and git state.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.400]   You can log anything else you care about, from custom metrics to images,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.800]   matplotlib charts, histograms, and arbitrary HTML.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.400]   [music]
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   You can see your experiments and results in one place.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.800]   Our tables let you filter, sort, and group your runs to see what's happening in your training.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.600]   High-dimensional data is hard to understand, so we've built some visualizations to help.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   We handle massive distributed training to scale up to millions of runs.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.200]   You can write reports to document your work, collaborate with others, share your results, and see the progress of your whole team.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.400]   Our software is always free for students and academics,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.600]   and a company license is cheap compared to the headache and cost of redoing your research.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.000]   We use Weights & Biases with continuous integration a lot.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's extremely important to see that your model don't regress.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.800]   You know, it gives you a kind of sense of the pulse of the team, of how quickly you're moving and so on.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.400]   But it's also an extremely good way of just having full transparency in the work that you're doing with other people.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.000]   The scalability of Weights & Biases, the customizability vastly improved our productivity.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.600]   And these past six months, we've been extremely productive on the research front,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.200]   submitting five papers to the top conferences in machine learning and computer vision.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   I was really impressed with the productivity of the team,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.400]   and the creativity that was unleashed thanks to the benefits of this infrastructure.
