[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   We get a wide variety of questions from listeners, everything from the infralapsarian to superlapsarian
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.880]   debate to the most perplexing details of eschatology to people who want to know what Calvinism
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.480]   is and Reformed theology is all about to people who want to understand the gospel in this
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.440]   very basic form and to people who ask, "Why do Christians go to church in the first place?"
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.480]   We never want to assume questions or answers, so I'll ask one that I see a lot in the inbox.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.880]   It's a very simple one, Pastor John.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.640]   Why do Christians go to church and why on Sundays?
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.160]   Let's start by answering the question, "Who are Christians?"
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.080]   I'm assuming a question so basic is being asked by somebody who's kind of looking from
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.240]   the outside and may not have a real clear idea of even who we are.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:04.080]   Christians are people who recognize that even though, like all humans, we have been created
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.440]   in the image of God, we fall short of what God expects of us, and therefore we have sinned
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:23.600]   against Him and have belittled His glory by treating the things that He made as more valuable
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.880]   than He is Himself.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.280]   Christians recognize that we deserve to be punished for this.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   We really do.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.200]   This is a serious offense against the Creator of the universe.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:49.600]   And even more, we recognize that God is not only just in His punishments, but patient
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   and loving.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:02.200]   He has sent a Rescuer, His Son, a Redeemer, Jesus Christ, into the world to bear the punishment
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.160]   that we deserve.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.680]   And so the Bible says, "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.680]   in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.000]   And that "saved" means saved from God's wrath, saved from God's punishment, saved from hell
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.840]   and given eternal life.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   So Christians are people who have believed in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, who died
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.140]   for their sins, who rose again from the dead, who reigns in heaven today, will come again,
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.520]   and who are trusting Jesus day by day as their Savior from sin and judgment and as their
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.220]   supreme authority and as our greatest treasure.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.160]   And those people, Christians, are described in the Bible as not being merely isolated
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   individuals, but a corporate body with many members because they're all united to Jesus
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.180]   by faith.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.400]   And it's because of this unity in Jesus, this corporate nature of Christianity, that the
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.480]   church exists.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   The church is not a building.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.800]   It's not a structure of brick and mortar.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.300]   The church is the assembly of Christians gathered to express that unity in Jesus and to worship
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.700]   Jesus.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.720]   So the Bible says, "Now you, Christians, are the body of Christ and individually members
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.360]   of it," 1 Corinthians 12:27.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.920]   So coming together in various assemblies is essential to giving expression to the fact
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.400]   that Jesus died to create a united people, not just isolated Christian individuals.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.120]   So we find in the Bible then descriptions of those first century Christians gathering
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.860]   regularly.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.360]   This is what the question is about.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.660]   Why do you go to church?
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.880]   For example, in 1 Corinthians 11.18, it says, "In the first place, when you come together
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.280]   as a church," or 1 Corinthians 14.23, "if therefore the whole church comes together,"
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.880]   so all those texts are followed by instructions for how to behave ourselves in the gathered
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.520]   church.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.720]   Then we find indications in the Scriptures of what we should do when we come together.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.400]   So the question might mean, "Why do you go to church?" or "What do you do when you go
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.080]   to church?"
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.680]   Let me include some of these.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.960]   All of these instructions in the Bible flow from the fact that Jesus is alive, Jesus is
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.480]   worthy of receiving our regular corporate attention and worship.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.240]   In other words, these things that the Bible says we should be doing are not arbitrary.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.080]   They are organically related to the fact that Christians know and love and follow the living
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.120]   person of Jesus Christ, who died to create a people for himself, a worshiping people.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.520]   So for example, it says in Ephesians 5.19, "We should address one another in psalms and
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.720]   hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord."
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.480]   So if you go to any typical church, you're going to probably hear a good bit of singing.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.600]   And that singing is designed to give heartfelt expression of praise to God and praise to
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.880]   Jesus for all that they've done to save us from our sins and from the wrath of God and
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.120]   from hell and from a miserable eternity.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.200]   And then we read instructions about corporate praying, not just singing, but praying.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:10.480]   For example, 1 Corinthians 14.16 says that we shouldn't pray in public in an unintelligible
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.720]   way because then other people won't be able to appreciate what we're saying and say a
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.680]   hearty "Amen," which is the whole point of public praying.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   And then we read instructions about preaching, the inspired Word of God.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:35.320]   Paul said in 2 Timothy 3, "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching."
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.840]   And then he adds to the young pastor, Timothy, "Preach the Word."
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.200]   So a regular part of most Christian church services is a sermon where a pastor is called
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.720]   by God and gifted by God to study and understand the Bible.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.040]   And then he stands up and he proclaims what God has said in the Bible for the encouragement
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.960]   and the strengthening and the unifying and the motivating of the people of God to be
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.320]   about obedience and service among their fellow man for the glory of Christ.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.200]   And then, of course, we read instructions in the Bible about the Lord's Supper and
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:22.800]   baptism, these two ordinances, we call them, that are supposed to mark Christian gatherings.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.380]   For baptism, it's just a once-in-a-Christian-lifetime event that introduces you through the death
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.360]   and resurrection of Christ and through the immersion in water into Christianity.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:42.960]   And then the Lord's Supper is that repeated experience of participation with Christ as
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   we eat the bread and drink the cup to signify his broken body and his shed blood for our
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   sins.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.280]   And different churches do it different frequencies.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.960]   Some do it every week, some do it once a month.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.680]   The Bible doesn't tell us how often we have to do it.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.960]   It just says, "As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.160]   Lord's death until he comes."
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.600]   And if the question means, "Why do you do it on Sunday?
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.840]   Why do you Christians go to church on Sunday?"
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:21.720]   The answer is that Christian worship has its roots in Judaism.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:29.200]   It was born among Jews, and the Jewish Bible is the first part of the Christian Bible.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.440]   And among the Jews, it was said in the Ten Commandments, "Remember the Sabbath day
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.280]   to keep it holy."
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:44.120]   The Sabbath day was the seventh dayâ€”Saturday, not Sundayâ€”and so there was a one-day-in-seven
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.480]   rhythm as the Jews gathered.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.720]   And in the first century, when the Christian church was being born through the coming of
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.080]   Jesus, that was the custom, because we read in the book of Acts of Paul going in on the
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:05.040]   Sabbath day to the synagogues and joining with the Jews to preach Christ.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:13.720]   And the reason Christians switched and began to worship on the first day of the week is
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.160]   because Jesus was raised from the dead on the first day of the week, and that came to
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.960]   be called the Lord's Day, Revelation 1:10.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.040]   And we read examples of the gathering on the Lord's Day or the first day in Acts 20, verse
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.040]   7.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.280]   They gathered on the first day of the week, and in 1 Corinthians 16, 2, they were to come
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.520]   together and give their offerings on the first day of the week.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.160]   So that's why we do it on Sunday.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.520]   Jesus rose from the dead, created a new people for himself, inaugurated a new humanity, a
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.840]   new creation with a new day of worship.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.920]   So let me sum it up like this.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.720]   The reasons Christians go to church on Sunday is because they have been rescued from their
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   sins.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:11.480]   They've been rescued from our sins, united with a risen, living Christ, and with each
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.400]   other through faith in Jesus.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:24.080]   And because of that union with Jesus and with each other, the Bible, God's Word, calls us
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   to regular, weekly expressions of our corporate joy and thankfulness before God in worship,
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.400]   not just isolated Christian individuals scattered around, but corporate gatherings, praying
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.200]   and singing and hearing God's Word and celebrating the ordinances of Jesus.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.080]   Boy, that's quite a summary answer to several fundamental questions.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.720]   And tomorrow we're going to be back, and we're going to go deeper, much deeper, and we're
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.600]   going to look at the very purpose of why Christians exist in the first place.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.640]   I mean, talk about foundational questions.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   You won't want to miss this one.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.480]   We're going to take a closer look at Revelation chapter 13.
