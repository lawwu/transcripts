[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:20.240]   the book of the prophet Isaiah, the 40th chapter, verses 13 and 14. Verses 13 and 14 in the
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:30.200]   40th chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah. "Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.240]   or being his counsellor, hath taught him; with whom took he counsel, and who instructed
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.520]   him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.320]   the way of understanding." Now those two verses come, as many present will recall, from last
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   Sunday evening in a paragraph that runs from the 12th verse to the 17th verse in this great
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.560]   and mighty chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah. In the first 11 verses the prophet has been
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.840]   delivering his message, which is a great synopsis, a summary, if you like, of the Christian message,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.640]   of the Christian gospel. He's been giving us the exhortation to proclaim it abroad,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.960]   as he was himself commended to proclaim it. And he has been describing the character and
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.560]   the greatness of this salvation that God is going to give, beginning with the famous words,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.040]   "Comfort ye my people, saith your God, speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.240]   her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, for she hath received
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.640]   of the Lord's hand double for all her sins." Very well. He has made the great proclamation.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.720]   He's announced God's message of salvation. Then, having done that, in this 12th verse,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.440]   he turns to a new section in which his great concern, it seems to me, is to help us and
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.680]   to aid us to believe that message. The help is needed because of the staggering character
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.840]   of the message, the proclamation. And therefore, he comes, I say, to our help and to our aid.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   It all seems so incredible, so impossible. This talk about the glory of the Lord being
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:53.080]   revealed, this statement that all fresh shall see it together, this amazing statement, "Behold
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:01.000]   thy God." And yet the other aspect that constantly comes with it, the suggestion of the humiliation
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   and so on.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.360]   Now, we begin considering the help which the prophet here gives us last Sunday evening
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.880]   as we first looked at this paragraph from verse 12 to verse 17. And I suggested this,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.160]   that all our difficulties ultimately arise from one common source and origin, and that
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:31.080]   is our ignorance of God. It is our failure to realize who and what God is that ultimately
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.400]   accounts for every rejection of the Christian gospel and the Christian faith.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.680]   So the prophet, as he comes to our aid, starts by telling us something about God. And I suggested
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.360]   that he said three things about God in this one paragraph. The first thing he emphasizes
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:58.080]   is the greatness and the might and the majesty of God. He puts it like this, "Who hath measured
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.200]   the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with a spen, and comprehended
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   a balance?" Who's done that? The answer is God has done that. That's God.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.640]   And then you remember how he goes on to say that, "Before God the nations are as a drop
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance. Behold, he taketh up
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.840]   the isles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and are counted
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.160]   to him less than nothing, and vanity."
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.720]   Our real trouble, my friends, is we've no conception of the greatness and the majesty
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:56.200]   of God. God the creator, the maker, the artificer, the sustainer of everything that is, the everlasting
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.840]   almighty God.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.160]   And then he went on to emphasize the glory of God. He says, "Lebanon is not sufficient
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.320]   to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering." If we offered the
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.000]   whole world to God, we wouldn't be offering enough. His glory is so great and so transcendent.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.640]   Here again is something that we are tragically ignorant of. We don't realize the glory
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   of God.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.400]   Now, all our problems, I was suggesting, with regard to the Christian faith, with regard
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.640]   to the Christian faith in general, and all its particular statements, they all rarely
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.240]   come out of the fact that we're not clear about those two things. Any difficulty anybody
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.400]   who is present tonight may be in with respect to miracles, with respect to the incarnation,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.440]   with respect to the doctrine of the atonement, the sacrificial death of the son of God. People
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.080]   say they can't understand that, they can't see the necessity of that. The real trouble
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.080]   is they know nothing about the glory of God.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   You see, if you cut down all the trees of Lebanon and burned them all and killed all
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.680]   the animals on the mountain and offered the whole lot together as a burnt sacrifice and
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.960]   offering, it isn't enough. The glory, the holiness, the greatness of God are such that
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   He demands a perfect offering, and there's only one that is sufficient, the one that
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.920]   has been offered, His only begotten Son, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   whole world.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.000]   Now then, says this man, if you're in trouble and if you're in difficulty, stop for a moment
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.320]   and realize who's giving this message. If you stagger at it, if you stumble, if it seems
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   so immense and so great, just remember that that is the one from whom it's come, God.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.480]   And then, I indicated at the close that the third thing that he tells us about God is
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.960]   one that follows quite inevitably and quite logically from the other two statements, and
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.720]   that's the one to which I'm anxious to call attention this evening. I put it in a phrase
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.160]   like this. The phrase doesn't matter, but if you like to have it in a succinct form,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:31.480]   it is this, the inscrutability of God's ways and of God's mind. Now here it is put in detail,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:41.000]   who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, or been His counselor, has taught Him? With whom
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.360]   took He counsel and who instructed Him and taught Him in the path of judgment and taught
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:53.520]   Him knowledge and showed to Him the way of understanding? Who did so? That's His way
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:00.920]   of saying the ways of God are beyond our understanding, they're inscrutable, they're eternal like
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.680]   His power and like His glory. Well, now that, I say, is the thing to which I'm anxious
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.960]   to call attention tonight, because I suppose that of all the difficulties with regard to
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.360]   believing and accepting the Christian faith, there is none which is quite so common as
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:25.320]   this. It's always been a trouble, it's always been a problem. Even some of God's greatest
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.440]   saints, when God spoke to them and gave promises to them, they couldn't believe it, it seemed
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:39.160]   impossible. God's thoughts and God's ways and God's word have always staggered me. They
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.320]   found the thing almost incredible because it's incomprehensible. And the same is true,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   you'll find it running right through the Old Testament. And when you come to the New Testament,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:58.920]   you find precisely the same thing. I think I indicated last Sunday evening that even
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:05.960]   Mary, the mother of our Lord, herself gave an exhibition of this when she said to the
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.200]   angel, "What you're saying to me is impossible, it can't happen. This kind of thing can't
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.520]   happen. How can I thus give birth to a child and I'm not married?" And the answer came
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.000]   back with, "God, nothing shall be impossible." Well, now there it is. And here it is put
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.400]   in this interesting manner for us here by the prophet. Now, in the New Testament, there
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:40.120]   are two places in which this word of the prophet is quoted and in which it is expounded. And
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.880]   therefore if we are anxious to understand exactly what it is the prophet means, we can
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.520]   do nothing better than consider those two places in which these words are quoted. The
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.800]   first is in the epistle to the Romans in the eleventh chapter. This is how I read, starting
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.400]   at verse thirty-three. "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.840]   God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out! For who hath known
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.000]   the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor, or who hath first given to him,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.680]   and it shall be recompensed unto him again. For of him, and through him, and to him are
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:33.080]   all things, to whom be glory for ever. Amen." That's one of them. Now there, you remember,
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:39.720]   the apostle is concerned about the ways of God with respect to mankind. He is dealing
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.400]   with that profound difficulty which he argues out in chapters nine, ten, and eleven of that
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.680]   mighty epistle to the Romans, how God seems to have gone back on his promises. He's chosen
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.920]   the children of Israel, yet how few of them, as it were, are believing the gospel, and
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.640]   how many Gentiles. How is all this to be reconciled? That was the problem. And the apostle works
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.520]   out his mighty answer, with its incomparable logic, I say again. And then, having said
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.360]   it all, that's how he ends. "I've said all this," he says, "in effect, but oh, the depth
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.160]   of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:24.880]   and his ways past finding out!" That's the thing. We can but dimly look at it and grasp
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:33.440]   it, understand it up to a point, but the thing itself is beyond us, past finding out. I don't
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.800]   stay with that this evening, because I'm anxious rather to consider the other place in which
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.440]   this same statement is quoted, namely, in that second chapter of the first epistle to
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.280]   the Corinthians, which we have read together at the beginning. It's there in the last verse.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:58.280]   "For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?"
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:06.320]   Now, in this second chapter of this first epistle to the Corinthians, we have what seems
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:13.680]   to me to be an extended exposition by the inspired apostle of the very thing that was
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:20.000]   hinted at there back in that fortieth chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah. Here's
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.720]   the problem, you see. Here is God's proclamation of what he's going to do, and men can't understand
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   it. They say, "Is it possible all flesh is grass and all the glory of men is the flower
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:40.200]   of the grass?" How can these things be? And here's his answer. It's God, it's his power,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.800]   it's his glory, and don't try to understand his ways. They're past finding out. Now then,
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.600]   here I say in this second chapter of first Corinthians, and also partly in the first
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:58.280]   chapter, which we also read at the beginning, the apostle takes up this whole question.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:05.400]   And he did so, of course, because in a sense he had to do so. Paul was constantly meeting
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:11.760]   this difficulty and this problem as he preached the gospel to the Greeks. Now the Greeks were
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.040]   very intelligent people. They were very clever people. They were the philosophers. Greece
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.480]   was the home of the great philosophers. And all these Greeks were interested in these
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.320]   matters. Of course, what the Greek wanted above everything else was wisdom. And that's
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.800]   why Paul keeps on arguing so much about wisdom. The Greek was a man who said, "Now this world
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:39.360]   has gone wrong. There are troubles and there are problems, and what we need is wisdom."
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.600]   And he was always ready to listen to a man who said, "Look here, I've got a theory which
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.200]   can explain everything to you, and I've got a plan of a utopia which will solve your problems
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.520]   for you." The Greeks were seeking for wisdom. To the Greek, the greatest thing in the world
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.680]   was knowledge and understanding. And whenever he was confronted by any statement, he asked
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.440]   that once, "Well now, what is this? What is this philosophy? How does this explain things?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.920]   What kind of understanding does this give to me?" And do you remember how the apostle
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   Paul arrived in that country and began to preach his message? And we've got a graphic
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:21.400]   description of him doing so in Athens, the great metropolis of all this kind of activity.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   And do you remember what they said about him after listening to him for a while? They said,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.720]   "What will this babbler say?" The whole thing seemed to them to be utterly ridiculous. They
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:38.400]   couldn't understand. As Paul himself reminds the Corinthians, "It was foolishness. It seemed
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.600]   to be unutterable folly. It seemed to them to be nonsense, because the apostle, you see,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.680]   just stood before them, and what did he do? Well, he tells us he preached Jesus Christ
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.860]   and him crucified." Everything about the man and his message and his preaching seemed
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.760]   to them to be utterly ridiculous. He didn't adopt the pose of their rhetoricians and their
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   orators. He wasn't careful about his language and his diction and the balance of his phrases.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:11.280]   He didn't conform to the schools. He seemed to be a poor speaker. And they didn't realize
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:18.040]   that. They said, "His presence is weak and his speech is contemptible." You see, he didn't
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:24.320]   speak to them with the wisdom of men. He wasn't ornate, and he hadn't his sermon dotted with
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.080]   quotations and apt allusions and so on. It wasn't a work of art. It wasn't the kind
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.360]   of thing to which they'd been so accustomed from their own philosophers and their great
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:43.560]   orators, their professional orators. And as for his message, instead of considering the
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.000]   rival schools of thought and putting up the theories on one side and then criticizing
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.620]   them and evaluating them and then putting up the theories and the ideas and the concepts
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.200]   of the other school and doing the same and then giving a balanced judgment, this man
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.560]   seems to have stood before them and just told them a story. He told them something that
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   had happened. His message was about someone who was a carpenter, a Jew, not a Greek, a
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:21.920]   Jew. And especially it was how this person had died upon a cross, was crucified in apparent
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.200]   weakness and buried in a grave. But Paul went on to say that he rose again. And the whole
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.720]   thing to these people was monstrous. It was ridiculous. Where was their philosophy in
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.160]   this? Where was their understanding? Where was the wisdom in this kind of thing? This
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:43.640]   was rubbish. It was folly. It was something that to them was quite intolerable. That was
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:50.120]   the charge that they kept on bringing against the apostle. And it's quite clear from the
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.760]   context that there were even some members of the church at Corinth who were a little
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.760]   bit tempted to bring the same charge against him, having listened to certain other people.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:05.200]   Now what is the apostle's answer to all this? That's the interesting thing. Well, Paul's
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:16.840]   answer is this. It is not to say that the gospel is itself irrational or unintelligent.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.640]   It is not to say, "Ah yes, you are great philosophers and you are seeking wisdom. Of
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:30.760]   course I have no wisdom to give you. I am simply an emotionalist. I am simply a sentimentalist.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.440]   I am simply here to play lightly upon your surface emotions and get you to do what I
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:43.640]   want you to do." That wasn't what he said at all. He said the exact opposite. Far from
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:51.000]   agreeing to the suggestion that he had no wisdom to offer, the apostle says the position
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.960]   is in reality the exact reverse. He says, "You don't realize it, but I was offering
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:11.640]   you and preaching to you the only true wisdom." "But you know," says Paul, "it isn't
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:19.960]   the sort of wisdom that you know and can understand. It is God's wisdom." "That's
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.400]   the trouble," says the apostle, "that's the difficulty. That the wisdom I presented
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.840]   to you isn't man's wisdom, but God's wisdom." "So you see the trouble is," says the
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:37.960]   apostle, "not that I'm not preaching wisdom, but that my wisdom is so exalted because
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:44.280]   it is from God that you don't understand it and you think it's folly." The difficulty
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.400]   is not in the message, it's in you. It is your sheer inability to understand it and
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:58.880]   to grasp it. It's your finite attitude. It is your finite condition. "You say it's
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.720]   folly," says the apostle, "but it's only folly to you because it's so great."
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.560]   Now this is something, of course, which is absolutely vital to an understanding of the
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:15.720]   Christian faith and its message. Sometimes its own protagonists have done it a very grave
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:22.400]   injustice. The way to answer the wisdom of the world that comes with its criticism of
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.080]   the Christian faith and the Christian gospel is not to say, "Well, of course, we've
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.800]   got no wisdom. We are just ordinary people. We live in the realm of the emotions." The
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.840]   way to do it, I say, is not that, but is rather to turn on them and to say, "Do you want
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:41.440]   wisdom? Well, here is wisdom, by the side of which all your vaunted and bursted wisdom
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.360]   is nothing but unutterable folly." Now, actually, the prophet Isaiah goes on to say
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.000]   that in his fortieth chapter, and God willing, we hope to go on to consider that. I leave
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.600]   that for tonight in order that I may give you a positive exposition of what the great
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:03.940]   apostle rarely says. Listen to him. "How be it," he says, "we speak wisdom among
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:11.280]   them that are perfect." Now then, notice, "Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.160]   the princes of this world, that come to naught." The princes and their philosophies come to
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:29.520]   nothing. "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.920]   God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.560]   for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory," and so on.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:49.520]   Now that is the answer. Now let me try to put this to you in the form of a number of
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:58.240]   simple propositions. Is there anyone, I wonder, listening to me who is not a Christian and
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.920]   who does not believe this gospel, and is that your reason for doing so? Do you say, "Now,
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.360]   I have been accustomed to thinking things out. I have been accustomed to accepting things
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.920]   only as I can understand them. I have been trained always that I must never commit intellectual
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.680]   suicide, that it is a very wrong thing for a man to submit himself to something that
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.440]   he does not understand. All my training, all my knowledge and learning in life and in the
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.880]   world has taught me to concentrate and to think and to meditate. I do not go into a
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.120]   business, I do not buy anything, unless I know what I am doing, I do not believe anything."
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.960]   "Now that is my position," says the man. "Now your gospel," he says, "comes to me and tells
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.200]   me things of a type and of a character such as I have never heard before, and I cannot
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.960]   understand it, and it therefore seems to me to be folly. It seems to be unutterable foolishness,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.400]   and because he cannot understand, he rejects it in total."
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:57.720]   Now what is the difficulty with such a man? Well, I am suggesting that it is the old difficulty
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.320]   which the Greeks always had when the apostle Paul preached his gospel to them. My dear
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:09.360]   friends, the difficulty about believing the Christian message is not a matter of details,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:15.840]   it is a matter of one's whole approach. It is your fundamental attitude towards it that
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:22.200]   matters. And I am suggesting again tonight that the trouble with most people is that
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.880]   their attitude towards it, their approach to it is so utterly wrong that they cannot
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:34.480]   possibly be right at any point. Now let me put that in the form of a number of propositions.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.440]   What is this gospel? Well, the first thing the apostle tells us about it is that it is
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.840]   God's wisdom. We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:56.360]   world, nor of the princes of this world. We speak the wisdom of God. Now that is the starting
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:03.680]   point, and it must always be the starting point. I wonder whether we are all perfectly
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:12.840]   clear about this, that when we are in a meeting such as this, we are doing something which
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.200]   is altogether and entirely different from anything and everything that we can do in
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:24.280]   the world outside. Take all your learned societies, take all your cultural media, take all of
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:30.440]   them and put them together. Now there I say they belong to a category which does not include
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:39.080]   us. Here we are in a different realm altogether. All those derive from men. They are all the
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:45.560]   result of men's thought, men's so-called inspiration, men's imagination, men's gifts, men's ability.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.520]   It's all right. I'm not criticizing them. They're all excellent. All I'm trying to show
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   is this, that the gospel should never be put into series with them because it doesn't belong
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.400]   to them. All those things, and let us praise them, let us praise God for all human ability
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.720]   and everything that is a noble life. Let's thank God for sculpture and art and music
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.760]   and poetry and all these things that are uplifting and elevating. They're all marvelous. They
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:20.080]   testify to the greatness of men made in the image of God. But my dear friends, don't put
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:28.160]   this amongst them. It doesn't belong there. This isn't men reaching up. It's God coming
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:37.080]   down. It's God's wisdom. It's all from God's side. That's the thing that the apostle is
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:43.120]   expounding here. That's the thing, you see, that Isaiah argued. He says it's God's thought.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.920]   It's God's plan. He says no one suggested it to God. No one stood at his elbow and gave
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.840]   him advice. Who was God's counselor? Who told him to do these things that God has done in
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:25:00.200]   Christ? No man at all. There was no man with him. It was God alone and only God. Indeed,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:08.760]   I want to go further and even say this. What God has done in the gospel excludes men altogether.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:14.360]   It isn't even a response to men or to men's request. You see, there are so many who think
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:20.880]   that men turn to God and make an appeal and make a request, and as a result of men's prayer,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.800]   God has responded and has done something. That, I agree, would have been very wonderful,
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:33.200]   but the gospel is infinitely more wonderful. It was while we were yet enemies that God
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:39.760]   did this. It wasn't in response to our appeal. It was in spite of us, in spite of what we
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.360]   were, in spite of what we'd done. It is all of God. It's God's thought. It's God's plan.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:52.040]   It's God's mind. It's God's organizing. It's God's everything.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:26:02.160]   Oh, I can never emphasize this too much because it is the stumbling block. The world has thrown
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:09.680]   up its great men. Christ came down from heaven. That's it. And that's true of the whole of
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   the gospel. Are you convinced, my friend? Do you see at the very outset and at the very
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.480]   beginning that you must put aside all your ordinary canons of thought and all your terms
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.520]   of reference and all your usual measurements? I rather like the way in which Isaiah puts
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:35.640]   it. You notice how he puts it? He put it like this. He's been talking about God measuring
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.560]   the heavens and God weighing the mountains in the scales and the hills in the balance,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.800]   you remember. And then he goes on to ask a question. He says, "Is there anybody who can
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:53.120]   weigh the Spirit of God?" He says, "How foolish you are. If you can't weigh and spend and
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.640]   measure the greatness of God, how can you possibly measure and weigh the mind of God?"
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.960]   "You're trying to do it," says the prophet. And the apostle repeats the same argument.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.160]   You start by saying, "Now unless I understand everything fully, I'm not going to believe
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.360]   it." Do you realize you're trying to measure God and to comprehend Him with your little
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:19.080]   pygmy mind? My dear friend, it's foolishness. If God is God, that's by hypothesis quite
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:26.560]   impossible. And we are speaking about God and the gospel is His thought. It's His understanding.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:33.400]   It's His plan. It's His scheme. Can you measure it? Was there any man suggesting it to Him?
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:41.240]   There was no such thing. It is all and altogether and entirely of God. No man has been His counselor.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:51.920]   The thing is monstrous. Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Where
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.680]   are your greatest philosophers? Bring them along. Let them come. Let them try to examine.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:03.760]   Can any of them measure and weigh the mind, the spirit of God? The thing is too foolish
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:14.240]   even for an answer. Well, no, that's His first statement. We preach the wisdom of God. But
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:23.080]   you notice He didn't leave it at that. He says we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   in the hidden wisdom. Now what a vital statement this is again. It was almost enough to say
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.960]   that it was God's wisdom. But with human nature as it is and with this craving for understanding
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.240]   and this belief in the power of man's mind and philosophy to comprehend even the infinities
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.560]   and the eternities, the thing has got to be put very plain and beyond a poor adventure.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:57.680]   It's not only the wisdom of God because it's the wisdom of God. It's a hidden wisdom. It's
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:07.320]   a mystery. Something which is at one and the same time revealed and hidden. The mystery.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.680]   Now what does He mean by this? Well, let me divide it up. Indeed the apostle does so for
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:17.880]   us in this second chapter of this first epistle to the Corinthians. He tells us that this
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:25.680]   mind of God, this plan of God, this great purpose of God in the gospel is something
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:33.920]   that man by nature is not even aware of. He doesn't know that there's anything happening.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.640]   The average man in the world tonight is rarely quite ignorant about God's way of salvation.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.000]   He's not aware of it. He doesn't seem to know that anything's happened. You ask him what
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.040]   he thinks of the things that happened nearly two thousand years ago, he'll shrug his shoulders.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.400]   The greatest thing that'll ever happen in time has already taken place. Does the average
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.920]   person know that? No, no, he's quite unaware of it. It doesn't affect his life at all.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.040]   He says he's influenced by history. The biggest thing that's ever happened in history doesn't
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   influence him at all. Why? Well, it's a mystery to him. He doesn't understand it. It's hidden.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:19.600]   We're all talking about history today, aren't we, and about time. But what the natural man
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   doesn't realize is that there are two types of history. There is the history you can read
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.640]   about in your secular history books about kings and princes, and about wars and disputes
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.440]   and economic changes and things like that. It's all very important. Yes, but remember
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.000]   there's another history running parallel with it. It's the history you find in this book,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   the history of redemption, the history of what God has done in this world of time. The
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.320]   two come together now and again, but they're running there along parallel lines. The world
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.400]   sees the one, it doesn't see the other. It isn't aware of this. It's not interested in
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.320]   it. Oh yes, we're all trying to look into the future. Is there going to be another world
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.720]   war, we're asking. Are certain things going to happen? My dear friend, that's quite all
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:08.320]   right. That's one history. That's secular history. But how much trouble is man giving
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.880]   to this other history which tells us that the day is coming, it may be soon, I don't
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.400]   know, when the Son of God will come back again into this world, riding the clouds of heaven
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.560]   as the King of kings and the Lord of lords. It's there, it's real, it's going to happen.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.280]   But the world is not aware of this. It's hidden to it. It's living as if that thing had never
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:35.640]   happened and nothing's going to happen. It's hidden. It's a mystery. But I'll go further.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.480]   I'll say even this, that when it's actually enacted before his eyes, the natural man doesn't
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:50.800]   see it. Even the princes of this world don't see it, says Paul. And when he says princes,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.960]   he not only means kings and people like that, he means the great philosophers, the kings
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.400]   of thought, the kings in every realm of life. He says which the princes of this world, none
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.000]   of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would not have crucified
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.920]   the Lord of glory. They looked at that person, they said, "Who is this fellow, this carpenter
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.780]   of Nazareth, this son of Joseph?" They looked at him and that's all they saw. I see other
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.800]   men looking at him and this is what they say, "And we beheld his glory, the glory as of
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.400]   the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." Two men, you see, looking at the
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:36.760]   same person. One sees a carpenter, the other sees the Lord of glory. It's a hidden wisdom.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:42.720]   It's a mystery. As I'm going to expand still further in a moment, but you see we must realize
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:50.040]   that all these statements are of very vital import. That even when God gives the revelation
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:57.880]   of his wisdom in a tangible form, the world doesn't see it, it doesn't recognize it.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:07.440]   I go one step even further. The world cannot understand it and it cannot receive it because
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:14.040]   it is a mystery. Listen to the apostle, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:21.480]   Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:30.320]   are spiritually discerned." The order to which they belong, the type of thing they
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:38.680]   really are, is such that man as he is simply cannot understand. He can't receive it. It
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.520]   seems folly to him because it's different from what he's accustomed to. That's the
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:51.600]   tragedy of man in sin. That God's wisdom is folly to man and he doesn't realize that
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.920]   his wisdom is folly to God. So that the final statement the apostle makes about all this
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:09.960]   is this, that the work of the Holy Spirit in us is absolutely essential before we can
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:17.880]   receive this gospel. Had you realized that the gospel itself says all that, my friends?
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.040]   Are you perhaps an unbeliever tonight because you say, "Well, I notice that the great
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   men don't believe it. I notice that the notabilities are not members of the Christian
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.680]   church. The great scientists and the great writers of novels and the great leaders of
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.040]   thought, they're not practicing Christians and they're great men. They have great
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.120]   knowledge and great understanding. And if they don't, well, I'd better not because
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:45.640]   they are my teachers and my masters." Are you arguing like that? The reply of the apostle
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.760]   to that is just this, that those men, though they're great men, are absolutely blind
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:59.400]   to these things. They're natural men. Without the inspiration, the guidance, the light,
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.000]   and the anointing which the Holy Ghost alone can give to no man are these things sense
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.120]   at all. And that's what happens when a man is converted. You see, for all his life he'd
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.320]   been saying, "Rubbish, nonsense, there's nothing in it." And he dismissed it and
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.400]   spat upon it and cursed it. And suddenly he sees it all and says, "This is life.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.040]   This is everything." What's happened? He's got the same brain. He's got the same
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.720]   understanding. He's got the same faculties. Oh, I'll tell you what's happened. The
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:31.760]   Spirit of God has enlightened him. His mind has been opened to the truth. The mystery
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.960]   has been revealed. The Spirit is essential. Listen to the apostle's way of putting
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:41.440]   all this. He says, "None of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.760]   they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, 'Eye hath not
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.680]   seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of men the things which God hath
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   prepared for them that love him.' But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:06.400]   For the Spirit such as all things, yea, the deep things of God." And then he uses this
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.840]   marvelous argument. "For what men," he says, "knoweth the things of a man save
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:19.880]   the Spirit of men which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:33.300]   of God." This is his argument. "I've got a secret in my mind. It's there in my spirit.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.200]   And you can try as you will, you can be learned and clever, you can't read the secret that's
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:46.520]   in my mind. And you'll never know what my secret is until I tell you. Isn't it like
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.840]   that with men," argues the apostle? "There are certain things right in the spirit of
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   men and no man can get at it. The man himself must reveal it." He says, "If that is true
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.680]   with men, how infinitely more so is it with God. If you can't even read the mind of a
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:10.120]   man whom you know well and get at his secret that he's holding in his spirit, how can
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:16.000]   you possibly ascend into the heavens and read and understand and fathom the mind of God?"
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.560]   He says, "You can't. There's only one who can understand the mind of God, that is the
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:27.760]   Spirit of God. And it is only when he reveals it to you that you'll understand it." That's
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:36.520]   the gospel method. So that this wisdom of God is indeed a hidden wisdom. It's a mystery.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.920]   "Don't be surprised therefore that all the great men perhaps in the world are rejecting
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.640]   it. You see your calling brethren," says Paul, "not many wise men after the flesh, not many
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:50.160]   mighty, not many noble are called. Why not? Because they trusted to their philosophy.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.480]   They wanted to understand the mind of God before they'd believe it. And they can't.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:02.560]   It's impossible." That was their folly. "And such men are as blind tonight as they've ever
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:11.840]   been. As our blessed Lord said, 'Unless he be converted and become as little children,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.400]   he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God.'" It's when you come and say, "Oh,
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.280]   I see it at last. It's God's thought. It's God's way. What a fool I've been trying to
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:29.640]   understand and insisting upon explanations. I see I must come as a child, as a suppliant.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.120]   I must come empty handed, empty headed in a sense, and listen and receive the revelation."
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.960]   It's then, and then only, when you realize your utter helplessness and your need of the
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.640]   Spirit that the thing becomes clear to you. Let me hurry on to one other thing. He says,
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:55.520]   "It was ordained before the world." He's telling us there's something about this wisdom of God.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:06.400]   God has not been surprised by what man has done. The gospel isn't an afterthought. The
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.080]   biblical teaching is that before the world was founded that God had planned all this.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:17.840]   God sees the end from the beginning. He knows everything. My dear friend, this world is not
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   out of God's hand tonight. It may appear to be, but it isn't. It is in God's hand. He knows all
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.080]   about it. He's seen it all from eternity. It is the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery ordained
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:38.040]   before the foundation of the world. In other words, God has a plan for this world and for
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:44.680]   this life, and it's revealed in this wonderful gospel. The gospel is nothing, if you like,
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:51.160]   but God's revealed plan and way of dealing with the problem of men in sin, of dealing with the
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:57.200]   problem of the world gone lost and gone astray, which all human ingenuity and ability cannot
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.520]   restore. It's been trying throughout the centuries, and it can't. Now God's plan comes in,
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:13.560]   and here is God's plan. And what are the elements or the characteristics of this plan? Well,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   here they are. He mentions them all in but a few verses. God's wisdom, God's way of solving the
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.960]   problem of mankind. What is it? Well, it's first of all something that we call the incarnation.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:41.760]   None of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:50.720]   carpenter of Nazareth. No, no. Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:58.200]   You see, this is God's wisdom. And how entirely, absolutely different it is from everything we've
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:04.440]   ever known. I look at a babe lying in a manger. Well, that's all right, you say. That's quite
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.560]   ordinary. There's nothing unusual about a helpless infant, a babe lying in a crib.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:15.720]   There's nothing marvelous about that. Is that God's wisdom? Wait a minute, my friend. Who is
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:26.000]   that babe? Who is that babe who will be playing with his little toys in a few months? Do you know
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.520]   who he is? He's the one who can take up the aisles as a very little thing. He's been playing with the
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:42.960]   cosmos before he ever came into it. The Lord of glory, the babe of Bethlehem. The carpenter,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.640]   the man who hadn't been to the schools, the apparent ignoramus, he's the Lord of glory.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.440]   Now, this is God's wisdom, you see. And you understand now why I've been emphasizing so much,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.720]   that you mustn't try to understand this. It can't be understood. It's inscrutable. Let us take our
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:05.680]   stand with Paul and say, "Great is the mystery of godliness." God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:19.040]   The Lord of glory is the babe of Bethlehem, the same person. Two natures in one person.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:28.560]   He's man, certainly, but he's God, certainly. He's perfect man, absolutely. He's perfect God,
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.400]   absolutely. That's what I'm preaching to you. I'm not preaching a human teacher. I'm not preaching
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   a great man. I am preaching to you the mystery, the marvel, the miracle of the incarnation.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:51.240]   God and man, two natures in one person, unmixed. Can you understand that? Was it some great
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:57.200]   philosopher who suggested that to God? Is that the sort of thing that man would be likely to tell God
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:06.320]   to do when he comes to save mankind? Out upon the suggestion, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord,
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.840]   the unutterable folly and impudence of men?" Asking for understanding, that's gospel.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:22.720]   The incarnation, God coming in the flesh, the eternal word, made flesh and dwelling among us,
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:29.760]   the Lord of glory. But wait a minute, it goes on. The second mystery is death.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:39.360]   For, he argues, had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:48.400]   I always have a sense of grudge at the people who overwork the word paradox,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.720]   because it means that it's so used and so hackneyed and so cheapened that one can't use it
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.800]   where it ought to be used. But if you want to know a mystery,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   if you want to know a real paradox, here it is. The Lord of glory crucified.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:15.120]   The word through whom and by whom all things were made and by whom they consist,
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:24.160]   crucified in weakness, rejected, despised of men, buried in a grave.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.800]   Are you still trying to understand?
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:35.520]   Is your mind still anxious to be able to spin it all? Well, can you take it in?
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:48.000]   The Lord of glory crucified, helpless, nailed to a tree, crying in agony, complaining of thirst,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.440]   dying, his body taken down, buried in a grave and a stone rolled over the mouth of the grave.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Crucifying the Lord of glory, life and death.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.720]   Oh, Peter put it in a very striking phrase, you remember, in his preaching to the people at
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.960]   Jerusalem, when he talks about putting to death the author of life.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:23.120]   Putting to death the author of life. My friends, this is either true, you know, or it's unutterable
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:29.680]   rubbish. It's one or the other, but that's the message which we preach. That is the Christian
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.000]   gospel. It isn't to tell you to live a better life and to pull yourselves together and turn over a
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.720]   new leaf and to come to church and things like that. No, no, it's an announcement to you that
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.800]   God has done this thing. He sent out, he sent forth his own son, made of a woman, made under the law,
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.600]   and he sent him to the death of Calvary's cross.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:46:00.080]   And why? Well, that's the next word. He says that all this has happened unto our glory.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:07.040]   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world,
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:15.440]   unto our glory. That is God's way of salvation.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.840]   That's God's way of saving us. We hadn't thought of it like that, had we? We thought we needed more
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:30.640]   education. We thought we needed more morality, pep talks. We thought we needed some great example,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.200]   and we could take up our stand and imitate him and follow him and say, "That's what we wanted,
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.400]   at last we've got it, and we're going to follow this marvelous exemplar."
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.960]   That's our idea of salvation, isn't it? Thank God it wasn't God.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:53.680]   Because I can't follow his example. I can't in my own strength live the sermon on the mount.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.960]   I can't even come up to my own standard. And I've got the problem of my past sins. They're there.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.280]   It's no use turning my back. I know they're there. It's written in the record. It's all there.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   Before I can be saved, I've got to be delivered from my past sins. God's wisdom has found the way.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:24.240]   "The Lord of glory crucified unto my glory. He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.880]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." That's just another way of saying it.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:35.600]   But it's a mystery, isn't it? It's extraordinary. Have you ever heard of anything like this before?
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:41.840]   That the innocent comes and dies for the guilty? That the God whom we've offended himself takes on
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   the problem and comes in the person of his son and bears it away? Had you thought of anything like that?
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   Had you been God's counselor? Is that the sort of thing you would have suggested to God?
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.800]   That's the argument of the prophet and the argument of the apostle.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:01.360]   My dear friend, can't you see that you've got to come to this with an entirely different attitude?
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.320]   It's altogether from God and it's altogether different and it cannot be understood.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:13.280]   It's the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery which is only revealed by the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:19.200]   but is revealed by him. And the last word I speak is this.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:26.160]   Listen to him in the twelfth verse now. He says, "We have received not the spirit of the world,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:38.480]   but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:45.840]   It's the crowning aspect of this mystery, this marvel, this hidden wisdom,
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:55.360]   a salvation that is given for nothing, freely given, without money and without price,
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:05.920]   given only to those who say, "Nothing in my hands I bring. Simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:12.720]   Naked come to thee for dress. Helpless look to thee for grace.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:21.920]   Foul I to the fountain fly. Wash me, Savior, or I die, a pauper, with nothing at all,
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.400]   not a fathing, not a vestige of righteousness, nothing, but it's freely given."
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:38.720]   Oh, Isaiah was very fond of this. "Oh, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, come,
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:43.600]   buy without money and without price." That's it. He keeps on saying it.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.720]   And here Paul is saying it. It is all freely given.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:55.120]   And do you know this is the ultimate folly and tragedy of men?
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:01.920]   There is nothing that he objects to more about the gospel than the fact that it's freely given.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:09.760]   Men in his pride wants to earn it. He wants to maintain his respectability. He says, "I'm not
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.560]   a pauper yet. Our Lord said to certain men who seemed to have believed on him one afternoon,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.800]   'If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall receive the
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.920]   truth, and the truth shall make you free.' They stood back and said, 'We be Abraham's seed,
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.240]   and we're never in bondage to any man. How sayest thou he shall be made free?'"
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.120]   But the gospel is unlike everything the world has ever known.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:44.800]   The offended God pardons freely. Oh, isn't this incredible that while we were yet sinners,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:50.640]   Christ died for us. While we were yet enemies, if we were reconciled, if while we were enemies,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.800]   we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, says Paul. And that is true.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:01.440]   God has done it all while you and I were still in enmity, not merely not suggesting it to him,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.960]   but utterly opposed to him and hating him. He did it all then, and he's done it perfectly,
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:16.160]   and he gives it to us freely. We preach the wisdom of God.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:24.320]   That's God's way of doing it. It's the way God has adopted. It's the way that God has done it.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.800]   He did. He has sent forth his Son, and the Son has come. And he set his face steadfastly to
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:36.640]   go to Jerusalem, and he went and gave himself passively to the suffering and the agony and
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:43.280]   the shame of the cross that he might atone for our sins and reconcile us to God. And in him,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:52.320]   God is offering you tonight freely forgiveness of sins, a restoration of the right relationship
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.600]   between you and himself. He'll give you a new life, a new nature, a new start. He'll give you
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:04.560]   the Holy Spirit. He'll make you an heir, and he'll give you a glimpse of the glory that he has awaiting
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:24.320]   you. That's the gospel, my friend. It's God's, God's power, God's glory, God's wisdom. Oh,
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:33.840]   the tragic folly of trying with your little mind to take in that.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:42.240]   There's only one thing for us to do, my friends, having thus tried to look at it inadequately.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:52.320]   We just must needs get down before God and say, "Lord God, forgive me my pride of intellect,
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:53:02.080]   my foolish pride in my feeble understanding. I see now it's thy way, not men's. I don't
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:09.360]   understand, but I believe. Grant it me. Give me this spirit that will enlighten me and enable me
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:16.160]   to believe. Confess your utter dependence upon him, and he will give you this spirit,
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:23.520]   and you will see the truth, and you will know that Jesus of Nazareth was the Lord of glory,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:31.760]   and that he came in order to die, that you might be forgiven, that you might be made a child of
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:39.040]   God and an heir of God, and be prepared for the glory that yet awaits you."
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:48.880]   That's the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom. But thank God it's been revealed,
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:57.840]   and there it is in Jesus Christ. Fly to him just as you are,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:07.280]   and depend entirely upon him, and be ye saved. Amen.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
