[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   The final thing that I always like to do is double check
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.580]   for the things that are flexible in our itinerary.
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   Kind of highlight them or circle them and say,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.720]   we know that we could trade this out if we needed to.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.060]   Right, we know that we can like cancel this if we had to
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.240]   because it doesn't matter to us or it's not locking us in.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.280]   So if we look at an itinerary a week out
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.880]   and we're like, whoa, this is a lot.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.040]   And this isn't matching the vision we set nine months ago
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.000]   when we had this idea, circle and create some space for you
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.080]   to be flexible with this trip.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.640]   Because you never know what might happen.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.360]   Friends of ours were just in Lisbon and Morocco
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.320]   and the moment they got to Lisbon,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.240]   their four year old developed an ear infection.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.320]   And so the next three days of the Lisbon plans
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.480]   were out the door.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.680]   You can't plan for that, right?
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.200]   So circle those things that don't really matter in the end
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.860]   and know that you have some flexibility
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.840]   going into your trip and then go have amazing,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.460]   amazing times, document the hell out of it,
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.160]   live in the moment, don't be on your phone
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.080]   looking at what everybody else is doing on Instagram.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   Be present, eat that thing, eat another one of them
