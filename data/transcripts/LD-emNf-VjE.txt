[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Pastor John, if you're up for it, give us a theology of biblical womanhood in five minutes.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.900]   I would start with where God starts in Genesis 1, where he says that God
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:26.060]   created man, male and female, in the image of God. He created them, not just the man.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.640]   And so I would start with the massive, and I mean immeasurably massive truth,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.520]   that men and women, and we're talking about women here, are created in the
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.480]   image of the Creator of the universe. This is simply stunning. It means that
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.360]   every woman you look at on the street, or every woman you relate to in any way, is
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:58.240]   a potential queen of heaven, because she's created in the imago dei. She's in
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.720]   the image of God in the same way that the man is in the image of God, having a
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.360]   human nature which mirrors the very nature of God. That's where I'd start.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.040]   Secondly, I would draw attention to the fact that her worth, therefore, when you
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.720]   talk in terms of dignity or worth, is the same as man's. In fact, I would say both
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.120]   male and female are essential to the full revelation of God's glory. He didn't
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.160]   just create man. When you get to the second part of the story, where man
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.880]   is created first, which I think is significant, and then woman is created, it
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.240]   says it wasn't good. It just wasn't finished. It wasn't good, until this woman
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.560]   who came from his side. No animal would do, because no animal was created in the
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.440]   image of God. She must be of his nature, and thus of the nature of God. So she's
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.960]   of an equal worth, and both together, then, are the fuller revelation of God's
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.120]   glory. And then I would say that she has unique, special capacities, both
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.800]   physically, mentally, emotionally, that are different from men. And we should
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.000]   celebrate the differences between manhood and womanhood, and stress that
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.480]   those differences are meant that when we're together, both as singles, I would
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.120]   argue, there are cultural dynamics for people who are not married, and then
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.840]   there's cultural dynamics for people who are married. When you're together,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.940]   something more beautiful is shown of God than if we were all in our little silos
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.680]   of individuality. And the last thing I would do is draw attention to what we
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.560]   mean by complementarity, and say that one of the unique things about women is that
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:55.080]   they are ordained by God, called by God, to receive honor, I mean, to receive from
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.640]   man, and honor man, and support the leadership, and the protection, and the
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.120]   provision of godly men according to those appropriate roles. And the reason I
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.640]   say that last little phrase is that as a woman navigates her life, if she's
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.960]   married, she's got a husband, she's got a pastor, she's got male friends who are the
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.800]   husbands of her female friends, she's got maybe colleagues at work, she's got the
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.200]   mailman who comes to the front door, perhaps, she has the mechanic at the
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   precision tune, and so on. All these males fulfill very different roles in her lives,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.000]   and I don't mean that she receives and honors and supports leadership,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.120]   protection, and provision from all of them in the same way. It's the dynamic
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.760]   and the dance of gender relations are different for every relationship, but
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.040]   there is something that God has put, I think, into men to be leaders and
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.400]   protectors and providers, and women to love that, delight in that, honor that,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.960]   come alongside that, use all their manifold gifts to advance the cause of
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.120]   Christ through that, so that when they're together, they are complementing
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.440]   each other and the beauty of God is displayed more fully.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.880]   Do you suspect that gender role differences will carry over into eternity?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.720]   Yes. Yes, because I think, even though the Bible says there'll be no marriage or
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.040]   giving in marriage, we won't have children in the age to come, I think that
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:43.760]   our personhood is so wrapped around our gender, or you could say our gender is
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.960]   wrapped around our personhood, that if we were stripped of our maleness or
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.880]   femaleness, we would be unrecognizable. I think Jesus is a man today in heaven. He
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.440]   is Jesus Christ, the same as He was here, well, He was glorified, and I don't think
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.000]   we should think of Him in some androgynous way up there, or ourselves,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.760]   entering into a kind of existence that has no correlation to the male and
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.120]   female that we had here, and it's going to be utterly, utterly beautiful.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   There, all the sinful dimensions of manhood and womanhood will be taken away.
