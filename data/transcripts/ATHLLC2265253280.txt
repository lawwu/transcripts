[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.560]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.640]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.640]   and each week I usually sit down
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.520]   with the world's best experts to learn the strategies,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.420]   tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.960]   Now, I've done a few solo episodes,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.880]   but they've usually just been listener questions.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.840]   So today I wanna try something new
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.640]   and do a solo deep dive on a topic I've researched a lot.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.240]   Now, I love to travel,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.640]   and there are some amazing hotels around the world,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.600]   but sometimes you just wanna stay at a vacation home,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.940]   whether it's 'cause you want a kitchen, multiple bedrooms,
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.360]   or you just want a private pool or a balcony
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   with an amazing view.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000]   So let's talk about all the ways to make that happen.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.640]   And when I say all the ways,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.240]   we're gonna run through home rentals, fractional ownership,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.460]   timeshares, vacation clubs, home exchanges,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.800]   private residence clubs,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620]   and even vacation real estate investment funds.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.760]   More on that one later.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700]   I spent a ton of time on this episode
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.380]   and have a bunch of topics I could do this on next,
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.780]   like insurance, parenting, credit card benefits,
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.840]   and a lot more.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.800]   So if you like this format,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   please shoot me a quick DM or email chris@allthehacks.com
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.960]   and let me know.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.320]   Okay, let's get into it.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.720]   But before we get started.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.760]   All right, let's talk vacation homes.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.960]   First, thanks to David, Scott, and Jesse,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.500]   who all emailed me to ask questions or share tips
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.240]   on timeshares or vacation homes
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.320]   and ultimately inspired this episode.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.280]   So I'm gonna walk through all the options
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.080]   and what I personally think of each.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.600]   And when we get to timeshares,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.040]   I'll even share a few stories
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.640]   from my family's experience with them.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.960]   So I'll start with the few options
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.500]   that have little or no upfront cost.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.400]   The first, home rentals.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's just what it sounds like.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.480]   We've probably all done this.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.080]   Renting a house, could be a condo or a villa
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.360]   on a platform like Airbnb, VRBO,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.240]   or even directly from an owner.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.000]   So I won't spend much time here,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.780]   but there are a few things that I found
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.560]   when I was doing a little bit of extra research
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.520]   that I wanna share.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.120]   First, there are a few sites that seem to organize
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   and curate just higher end properties,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.760]   or at least properties with a more consistent
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.880]   design aesthetic or quality or set of amenities.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   One of them is Avant Stay.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.080]   I've never used it, but it definitely looked interesting.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.000]   And on the much higher end,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.480]   there's one that I'm just really,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.800]   really interested in called Wander.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.880]   They only have 11 homes, but they're all beautiful.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.060]   Fast Wi-Fi, they have eight sleeps on all the beds,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.080]   Peloton bikes, they even have a Tesla you can drive,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.240]   and they have multiple high-end workstations
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.320]   with monitors, good chairs, microphones,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.800]   everything you need.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.100]   It's really the most turnkey rental I've ever seen.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.720]   I haven't been able to try it out yet,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.920]   but if you do end up wanting to book something,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.480]   make sure to email hello@wander.com
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.640]   and tell them I sent you,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.360]   and they said they'd give you $250 off your booking.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.560]   That is a referral link, but if enough people use it,
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.460]   I'll use the credit to go stay at a Wander
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.000]   and I'll let you know how it is.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.380]   A couple other sites.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.520]   When it comes to really high-end homes
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.500]   and villas and resort properties,
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.200]   there's two sites, Haven and Villas of Distinction,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   which I think are probably two of the best sites
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.560]   with the most comprehensive set of properties
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.920]   around the world.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.020]   But I will say there are a lot of local sites and companies
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.120]   if you're looking to go to different destinations.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.300]   So you really have to dig in.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.720]   For example, in all the group trips I've planned to Cabo,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.400]   I always use this one site called Cabo Villas.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.780]   So this is not meant to be entirely comprehensive,
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140]   but I wanna cover this category first
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.220]   because there's no upfront cost.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.060]   A lot of the different ways that you could buy
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.500]   a vacation home or a timeshare or anything like that,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.580]   you've gotta spend thousands, tens of thousands,
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.780]   hundreds of thousands of dollars upfront.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.340]   And this is one where if you wanna go stay somewhere,
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.540]   you could just book it.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.440]   Now, the reason why all of these other options exist
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.740]   is because if you commit to various lengths of term
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.260]   or specific places, you can get a better deal.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.000]   But if you're just looking for one trip,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.760]   it's much easier to just book the place you want
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.320]   than worry about everything else.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.840]   So this is great for one-off trips.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.520]   I will say the quality varies.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.460]   I'm sure you've all stayed at an Airbnb that was great,
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.760]   and then you probably stayed at some that weren't so great.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   The price varies, the fees vary.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.960]   I did see a post on Twitter that Brian Chesky,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.160]   the CEO of Airbnb is finally gonna try to figure out
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.760]   how to kind of curb the craziness that is Airbnb fees,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   where it's here's the cleaning fee, the housekeeping fee,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.400]   the booking fee and everything.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.180]   But I will say one thing that is tough
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.620]   is if you find a place you like
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.500]   and you wanna go there regularly,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.540]   it's really hard to guarantee anything.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.220]   Also, there are a lot of places
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.500]   that have restrictions on short-term rentals.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.420]   And so there are some places, Napa being one of them,
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.540]   that it's really hard to find a home that you can rent
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.100]   because of all the restrictions on short-term rentals.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.780]   I will remind everyone of one of my favorite hacks
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.020]   for booking these places is take the photo of the property
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.480]   and save it to your computer
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.400]   and use a Google reverse image search and search for it.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.280]   And you'll find that that property might be listed
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.080]   on five or six different sites.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.520]   And it might actually be cheaper on other sites.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.560]   So I'd say use that trick.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.660]   You might find that the place on Airbnb is 20% less
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.560]   if you book it on a local site, maybe like Cabo Villas
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.640]   or wherever you're looking for in the world.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.240]   Next is home exchange.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.640]   And this can literally be the cheapest possible way
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.720]   to stay at vacation homes around the world.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.300]   If you're unfamiliar and you've seen the holiday,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.140]   you remember Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.900]   swap homes across the world, fall in love.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.900]   Well, I guess after that, I'd always assumed
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.820]   that home swapping was about finding a specific person
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.720]   or a family somewhere in the world
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.580]   that happened to have a home you want
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.260]   in the place you wanna go at the exact time you wanna go.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.980]   And they too wanted to go wherever you live.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.500]   Well, the more I dug into this,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   the more I found out that the platforms
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.760]   that service home exchange have really evolved.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.420]   And I was definitely wrong.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.140]   There's actually a few different types of stays.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.580]   Simultaneous being the one I just described
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.600]   where you find someone who wants to stay at your home
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.300]   while you stay at their home.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.940]   There's also non-simultaneous,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.820]   which is someone wants to stay at your home
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.700]   maybe while you're traveling,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.700]   and then you can find a time to stay at their home
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.900]   some future date.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.780]   So it doesn't have to be lined up perfectly.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.660]   There's also something called non-reciprocal.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.140]   And this is where I think it gets really interesting,
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.040]   which is that most of the platforms
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.140]   have created some currency.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.900]   In one platform, they're called globes.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.580]   Others, they're called keys.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.700]   One of them, they're some kind of points.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.580]   And by listing your home,
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.180]   you're able to have people stay at your home
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.460]   and earn this currency in the exchange program
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.840]   that you can then use on a totally separate house
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.780]   that the owners were never planning
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.440]   on even coming to where you live or staying in your home.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.180]   There's also something called a hospitality exchange,
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.440]   which is where you stay with someone
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.020]   and then they come stay with you,
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.080]   but you're not actually getting the house to yourself.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.540]   But I'm gonna put that outside of the scope of this episode.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.620]   So the most interesting one here to me is non-reciprocal.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.360]   I'll just share a few of the platforms here
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.420]   in case this is interesting,
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.460]   because I think prior to doing some of this research,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.820]   this is something I never considered.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.460]   And now all of a sudden, I'm a little bit more interested.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.020]   There's Home Exchange.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.340]   They've got 450,000 homes in over 100 countries.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.740]   Love Home Swap and People Like Us.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.180]   Both also have thousands of homes in over 100 countries.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.220]   If you already have a second home,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.620]   and in many cases, even a fractional second home,
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.860]   which we'll talk about later,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.700]   there's a site called Third Home,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.760]   which basically lets you swap your second home
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.200]   for someone else's second home anywhere around the world.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.540]   Focuses on really high-end properties.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.660]   The minimum is that they have to cost $500,000
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.780]   and it goes all the way up to 50 million.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.700]   On the total other end of the spectrum is Couchsurfing.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.180]   There's 14 million members in 200,000 cities.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.600]   This is something that I think early in life,
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.560]   I found to be incredibly valuable.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.120]   Amy and I did Couchsurfing all over the world
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.300]   when we went on our trip.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.220]   And before we left,
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.820]   we hosted dozens of people in our home.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.740]   This is definitely more like that hospitality exchange,
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.620]   except there's no real exchange.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.740]   It's just a free thing that people do
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.420]   to get to know interesting people.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.260]   When we were doing it,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.100]   we'd always try to leave some nice gift,
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.460]   but at the end of the day,
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.940]   there's no expectation of compensation.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.960]   It's just a platform for travelers
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.660]   that like to meet other travelers
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.180]   and host them in their homes.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.720]   I highly recommend it if you're going on a trip
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.840]   and you're willing to sleep on a couch or a sofa bed,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.400]   or in some cases the floor.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.280]   And if you are, it's an incredible way to meet people
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.760]   and get to know a city.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.440]   And I have so many great memories of Couchsurfing.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.080]   There's one other cool site that a friend of mine
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   actually shared with me called MyPlace.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.640]   It's kind of like a hybrid of Couchsurfing,
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.520]   Home Exchange, Airbnb, where there's no real compensation.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.180]   It's not supposed to be a rental,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.880]   but it's only open to friends and friends of friends.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.760]   So they don't have the insurance policies
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.240]   that you would normally have.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.040]   And you can ask people to either cover your costs
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.640]   or maybe pay for cleaning, but it's not a rental service.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.960]   It's kind of interesting if you think,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.660]   gosh, I'd be willing to let MyPlace go
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.720]   to friends and friends of friends,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.400]   but I don't really want just random people to stay in it.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.100]   It's an option, or similarly,
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.840]   if you're looking for a place to stay,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.360]   it might be a place to find a good deal
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.380]   if you have friends that live all around the world.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.400]   If I can find discounts or referral codes for any of these,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.720]   I'll put them in the show notes
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.560]   or at allthehacks.com/86, which is this episode number.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.680]   As for what I think,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.980]   the overall benefit here is the cost savings, right?
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.800]   When you're traveling, your home is empty,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.520]   so why not get something for that?
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.200]   Or even if it's not a straight swap,
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.760]   maybe you're visiting family for the holidays.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.880]   Maybe you have a vacation planned already
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.160]   and your home's empty.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.600]   Why not list it on one of these platforms
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.760]   and earn whatever their virtual currency is
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.440]   and see if on your next vacation,
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.720]   you can use that currency to go somewhere for free.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.560]   So some other cool, fun things
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.120]   I was reading as I looked in these exchange platforms,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.760]   people include all kinds of things
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.400]   because it's really about getting to know the person
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.840]   even more than you normally would on an Airbnb.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.600]   So some people leave out their transit passes.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.660]   Some people will let you use their car.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.420]   Some people ask that, "Oh, you can stay here,
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.020]   "but you have to watch our dogs."
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.960]   So it's a little bit more of a person-to-person experience
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.120]   than just kind of a transactional book a property
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.340]   like you would with a rental.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.400]   But it seems, at least to me, kind of interesting
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.960]   if you can get past the obvious objection,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.660]   which is having people in your house.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.040]   In the past, we've had our place on Airbnb.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.280]   And as we were thinking about what we could do now,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.800]   we thought there were probably a couple rooms and closets
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   that we could just add a lock on,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.080]   get a little bit of privacy for some of our belongings.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.360]   Some of these platforms also collect deposits.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.160]   Some have insurance.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.400]   Some suggest maybe you should check
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.000]   with your homeowner's policy.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.480]   But when I was looking online,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.600]   even though these home exchanges aren't short-term rentals,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.320]   the short-term rental coverages you can buy for your home
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.640]   often will still cover you.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.160]   So I do think that if you can get over the fact
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.240]   that someone's in your house,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.200]   staying in your room and sleeping in your bed,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.640]   you can always buy a second pair of sheets, don't worry.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.800]   This could be a really, really interesting thing.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.000]   Also, I'm not an accountant,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.440]   so don't take this as tax advice,
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.320]   but because there's no money changing hands,
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.840]   I wouldn't expect you to get 1099s
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.600]   for your people staying in your home.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.400]   And so it could be a little bit better
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.280]   even just from a tax advantage standpoint
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.640]   of renting your place and then booking places.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.400]   I might try it out, see what happens.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.040]   If I do, I'll let you guys know.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   So those are two options that don't really require
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.200]   any significant upfront investment,
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.520]   but from all my research and personal experience,
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.840]   some of the programs that require an upfront investment
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.800]   can save you a ton in the long run
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.000]   if it's the right fit for what you're looking for.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.120]   Others can be a downright terrible investment,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.520]   so let's dive in.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.520]   And if the thing you really came for is timeshares,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.720]   I just wanna make sure you know I will get to it,
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.920]   but I'm gonna get to a few things first.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.400]   The most expensive option
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.840]   is to just buy an entire second home.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.240]   This one doesn't make sense to me
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.680]   because you can't be in two places at once.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.960]   So unless you plan on renting them each out
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.000]   and effectively becoming a landlord
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.840]   because you can't be in the same place twice,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.360]   which means you're gonna be renting out 365 nights a year,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.160]   that's just not something I'm interested in.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.440]   So for me, this was never an option,
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.040]   and it's also probably the most expensive option
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.880]   unless you wanna turn it into a rental.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.720]   So I'm gonna skip over that,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.440]   but I think you all know how that works.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.040]   You buy another second home.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.160]   Fortunately, there are quite a few ways
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.720]   that you can buy into vacation homes
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   for way less than buying an entire second home.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.320]   Some are effectively just clubs
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.080]   that you allow you to rent places,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.200]   but others are true equity programs
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.520]   where you can have real ownership in the real estate
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.360]   and benefit from any of the appreciation.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.920]   Unfortunately, there are so many different names
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.720]   when it comes to all of these things.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.120]   There's timeshares, vacation clubs,
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.680]   fractional ownership and private residence clubs,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.960]   destination clubs, luxury travel subscriptions,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   vacation real estate investment funds.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.840]   So to break this down,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.240]   I'm gonna split everything into two categories.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.120]   One, equity, where in one form or another,
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.840]   you're benefiting from the appreciation of the property,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.120]   and non-equity, where members or owners
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.600]   don't have any ownership interest in the properties
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.720]   and don't benefit from its appreciation.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.840]   I'll start with equity,
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.320]   and if you came here for timeshares,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.080]   unfortunately, it's not in this category,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.680]   and I'll explain more why later.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.240]   In today's internet age,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   people's personal information is being shared online
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.840]   with the click of a button, without their consent,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.920]   and it happens all the time.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.560]   But you can tackle this problem
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.440]   thanks to Delete Me from Abine,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.320]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.760]   for this episode.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.040]   When I used to Google myself,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.600]   I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.120]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.560]   family members, and a lot more.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.000]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.800]   which you can do, but after at least 10 hours,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.880]   I signed up for Delete Me, and it was so much easier.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.720]   Their software and team of experts
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.640]   will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.080]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.800]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.920]   and get that removed as well.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.080]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.840]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.680]   in their first two years.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.600]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.000]   removed from search results on the web,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.160]   go to allthehacks.com/delete-me
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.120]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.280]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/delete-me.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.120]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.520]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.400]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.560]   for a good hang.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.600]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.560]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.520]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.440]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.240]   take care of the supplies.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.880]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.320]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.280]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.760]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.840]   that you got through another week.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.920]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.480]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.240]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.320]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.960]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.560]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.520]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.560]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.400]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.440]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.080]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.560]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.200]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.500]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.520]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.560]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.920]   But first I'll talk about fractional ownership.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.840]   So this is true deeded fractional ownership in real estate.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.320]   Could be as simple as buying a home with a few friends
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.860]   and doing the DIY version,
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.800]   all the way up to buying multiple homes
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.400]   with people you've never met before.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.140]   My favorite example in this category is Picasso,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.320]   which full disclosure was how we bought our second home.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.080]   And only after that happened
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.800]   did they become a partner of the show.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.240]   And that's because I reached out to them
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.100]   because I really love the product
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.680]   and it's too bad they didn't reach out first.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.840]   Maybe I would have gotten a better deal on our place,
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.320]   but I think they explained the model really well.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.700]   So Picasso will buy a home, they'll furnish it,
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.560]   put it into an LLC with eight member interests
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.420]   and sell those to buyers.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.820]   So because you hold an equity interest in this home,
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.520]   you can get a loan from the purchase.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.760]   And when you wanna sell,
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.720]   you benefit from any appreciation.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.080]   In fact, Picasso resales have sold in an average of 12 days
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.320]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.380]   And I know that because I could see
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.400]   that I paid more than they did just a year before.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.760]   So the benefit of doing fractionals through a company
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.200]   versus doing it by yourself
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.920]   is that they manage all the aspects of the property.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.080]   Cleaning, paying utilities and property taxes,
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.200]   landscaping, maintenance, repairs,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.280]   and they usually have a system for scheduling
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.040]   and try to keep everything equitable between owners.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.280]   I can only imagine that if you were trying
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.600]   to do this yourself and having to come up with a system
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.240]   about who gets to stay when, it could get complicated.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.280]   But not all fractionals are for just one property.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.960]   I came across this site called My Five Homes
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.200]   that pairs you up with 20 other families
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.160]   who all collectively buy five homes.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.000]   So as an example, one I looked at
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.160]   is planning on buying a home in New England,
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.400]   Turks and Caicos, New York City, Park City, and Maui.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.880]   So this isn't just about buying one property,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.960]   there's all kinds of options here.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.560]   If you couldn't tell, I love the fractional model
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.240]   because what we wanted was to have a consistent place
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.040]   we could go with a bit higher end furnishings
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.120]   than some of the Airbnbs we'd seen
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.880]   where we knew how everything was set up
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.200]   and more importantly, we could leave some things
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.720]   in onsite storage.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   So for example, we have a bunch of non-perishable food,
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.520]   some clothes, a computer monitor, a dog bed, and more.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.120]   So we don't have to lug all that stuff with us anyways.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.840]   And the house itself actually also already comes
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.520]   with a crib, a baby monitor, a high chair,
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.440]   and all those things.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.960]   So for us, it was been so great.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.200]   Also, there are a ton of restrictions on short-term rentals.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.000]   So it's actually really hard and quite expensive
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.200]   to find a place you can rent with a few bedrooms
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.280]   for a family, but fractionals are true ownership
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.280]   and so they don't actually have those issues.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.960]   Now within fractionals, there's another category
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.840]   called private residence clubs.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.600]   They're often described as high-end fractionals,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.840]   but I've seen some really incredible fractionals
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.160]   that don't call themselves private residence clubs.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.240]   So I'm gonna focus on the other distinction,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.840]   which is that they're usually operated
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.640]   by luxury hospitality chains like Four Seasons
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.720]   or Ritz-Carlton and have the amenities typically found
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.200]   in high-end hotels or resorts.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.280]   These clubs often sell condos or villas with access
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.840]   to the club's golf course or ski resort,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.160]   along with maid-cleaned rooms and turndown service.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.120]   But a big selling point for some people
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.880]   is that owners also gain access to other properties
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.520]   in the chain's portfolio.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.800]   So for example, up in Napa, there's a resort
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.600]   called The Orchard at Carneros,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.200]   where you can buy a fraction of a two-bedroom condo,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.680]   but the property is part of Timbers Resorts,
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.400]   so you can also trade your place in
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.480]   for a stay at their other properties
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.000]   in places like Mexico, Hawaii, or Colorado.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.440]   That said, I have a friend
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.280]   that actually has a fractional in Timbers,
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.000]   and he said you really have to be ready
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.360]   to pull the trigger the second you find availability
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.140]   at any of the partner resorts,
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.720]   because it's extremely limited and it goes really fast.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.840]   Though another perk of private residence clubs
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.040]   is that some have a program
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.400]   that let you rent your place out
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.680]   if you're not gonna use it and either make some money
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.420]   or offset any of your annual dues
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.240]   that you pay for management or maintenance.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.760]   I assume some fractionals also allow this,
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.680]   but because private residence clubs are often at resorts,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.840]   it's a much more turnkey experience.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.940]   We actually considered The Orchard at Carneros
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.760]   because it was also in Napa,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.840]   but for us, we didn't really want a two-bedroom condo
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.320]   that would change every time.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.380]   We wanted a place that we could have all to ourselves
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.240]   that was big enough that we can invite family
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.740]   to come stay with us as well.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.780]   So if you're wondering what fractionals,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.040]   including private residence clubs, cost,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   I'd say at the very entry level
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.240]   where you might only get a couple weeks in a smaller condo,
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.040]   you're looking at $50,000 to $75,000,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.320]   but many are in the low to mid-six figures,
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.680]   and I've seen some fractions that cross into seven figures.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.260]   Like I said, another big benefit
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.480]   is that you can get a mortgage or a loan for fractionals
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.320]   because they're actual real estate,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.680]   but you also wanna make sure that you budget
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.080]   for your annual dues to cover maintenance,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.680]   management, property taxes, utilities,
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.600]   which probably is anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000 a year,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.800]   depending on the property.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.880]   Next, I wanna talk about
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.440]   vacation real estate investment funds.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.720]   When I first came across this, it was super interesting
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.520]   because in this model,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.800]   a company creates an investment fund
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.280]   that raises money to acquire properties
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.320]   and then lets the investors in the fund
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.920]   use those properties
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.420]   at some rate proportional to their investment.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.560]   So it's almost like investing in a private real estate deal,
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.240]   except you actually get to stay in the properties.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.060]   Now, a lot of private real estate deals
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.360]   are actually doing rentals, so there's less income,
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.280]   so I think the return on the investment
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.520]   might be more about the appreciation than the income,
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.800]   but it's still pretty interesting.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.600]   So the first example I found of this
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.520]   was called Equity Residences,
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.440]   which for their next fund is gonna raise $50 million
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.480]   to acquire 16 properties, mostly in North America
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.120]   and places like Hawaii, California, Florida,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.920]   the Caribbean, and Mexico.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.760]   And you can invest various amounts,
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   but at the lower end, you can invest $200,000
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.840]   and get one to three weeks of usage
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.140]   with annual dues in the few thousands of dollars.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.840]   So some cool things they do
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.960]   are they actually rent out properties
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.420]   when they're not in use
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.320]   to fund all the ongoing costs of the properties.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.720]   And then they also list those homes on Third Home,
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.200]   which is one of the exchange sites I mentioned earlier.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.480]   So you can actually exchange your time
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.540]   for properties outside of their portfolio.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.800]   But one of the major differences with this
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.360]   is around liquidity.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.080]   The Equity Residence funds
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.360]   are set up to be 10-year investments.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.720]   So while you can get your share
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   of the appreciation of the portfolio when they sell,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.660]   you can't just list your property or your share
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.200]   on an MLS site like you could with a fractional
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.120]   and sell it whenever you want.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.800]   You also can't get a mortgage
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.280]   because it's actually an investment
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.480]   as opposed to a real estate purchase.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.400]   So if you're comparing a fractional share
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.560]   that costs 250,000 and a $250,000 investment
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.740]   on one of these funds,
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.980]   you might only need to put 75,000 down on the fractional
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.460]   while you'd need the full 250,000 for the investment fund.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.860]   That was a huge factor for us
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.300]   when we were looking at options,
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.700]   but maybe more importantly,
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.100]   was that we wanted to make sure
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.420]   that if we were gonna purchase a vacation home,
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.460]   we really knew we would get the maximum usage out of it.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.100]   Otherwise, we knew it just wasn't gonna be a good deal.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.940]   And that meant we were looking for a place
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.180]   that was within driving distance of the Bay Area
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.980]   that we could go to regularly,
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.700]   and we just didn't find any of that
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.360]   with these fund options or private residence clubs.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.780]   So those are all the equity options
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.440]   where you have real ownership in a property
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.400]   and benefit from its appreciation.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   That's not to say the other options aren't a good deal.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.640]   I just needed a way to split things up.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.600]   And if you want links
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.160]   to any of the companies I'm talking about,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.840]   I'll put them all in the show notes and on allthehacks.com.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.120]   Now I'm gonna move on to non-equity
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.480]   and talk about destination clubs.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.500]   Now, depending on where you look online,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.340]   destination clubs might be two different things.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.880]   Some sites happen to say that destination clubs
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.280]   are actually equity, some aren't.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.200]   But because there's no consistent definition,
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.960]   I've decided that I'm going to use destination clubs
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.120]   to mean non-equity programs
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.800]   where members pay an upfront fee
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.640]   to gain access to a portfolio of residences,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.040]   typically multi-bedroom luxury homes all around the world.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.440]   And they typically come with the kinds of high-end concierge
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.120]   and hospitality services you'd expect at a five-star hotel.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.000]   They're usually set up with a lower fee,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.580]   like Inspirato starts at $600 a month,
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.320]   and then you just pay as you go for the properties.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.480]   Or sometimes they have much higher fees
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.580]   that require no additional cost to use the properties.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.660]   So example, one of these is called Exclusive Resorts,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.100]   and they charge $275,000 upfront
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.220]   and $36,000 a year in annual dues.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.260]   But after that, you get 25 nights a year at their properties
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.260]   for the next 30 years.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.940]   So there's a really great site I spent a lot of time on
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.260]   learning about everything I'm talking about
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.620]   called SherpaReport,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.940]   and they have a comparison list
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.500]   of all the destination clubs,
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.180]   so I'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.720]   But I think the reason most of the people I've talked to
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.340]   seem to like these programs are two things,
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.380]   and neither of them really applied to me.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.340]   One, they really appreciate the turnkey nature
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.260]   of the travel planning services,
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.060]   where you can say, "I'm going to this house in Italy,"
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.860]   and someone will plan everything around that trip for you.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.620]   And two, the kinds of homes that they're looking to rent,
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.860]   you just can't rent on other sites.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.340]   These two, five, $10 million homes
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.200]   that I've seen in a lot of these destination clubs
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.780]   just aren't on Airbnb that often.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.060]   Also, from my math,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.780]   it seems like you really need to be spending
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.940]   more than a few weeks traveling around the world,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.900]   staying at multi-million dollar properties
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.460]   to get a good value,
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.100]   and that just isn't us, at least not yet.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.920]   Another thing, from Inspirato's investor presentation,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.900]   since they were in the process of going public,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.100]   I saw that their destination club project has a 67% margin,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.540]   which means it's definitely a good business for them,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.900]   but it made me a bit skeptical
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.980]   on the value I'd be able to get from it.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.460]   Now, I'm sure a lot of their customers
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.980]   aren't maximizing their memberships,
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.060]   and that's contributing to that margin number,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.660]   and maybe if I signed up, I'd get a ton of value,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.420]   but it was an interesting data point.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.820]   Either way, I don't think it's the right fit for us,
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.580]   but speaking of Inspirato,
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.020]   they actually launched another product
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.860]   called the Inspirato Pass,
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.700]   which they're calling
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.500]   the world's first luxury travel subscription.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.300]   I saw a ton of advertising for it
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.980]   when it launched a few years ago,
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.520]   but I hadn't heard any firsthand reviews,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.880]   so all of my thoughts here
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.060]   are based on research and blog posts.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.860]   The way it works is a little complicated,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.300]   but my best stab at explaining it
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.060]   is that you pay $2,500 a month,
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.340]   and every time you book a stay,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.780]   it locks up your pass for a certain number of days.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.580]   So, if you wanna book the biggest,
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.020]   nicest property they have for two weeks,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.980]   it might lock your pass up for eight months,
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.300]   but if you book a smaller place for a weekend,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.620]   it might only get locked up for a month or two.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.960]   Then, once it's unlocked,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.780]   you can go and book something else.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.240]   I got a bunch of this understanding
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.340]   from this site Luxury Pass Review,
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.640]   where the author talks all about his experience
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.600]   with the pass and the tremendous value
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.260]   he believes he's gotten from it.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.540]   In the 21 months he's had the pass,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.540]   he said he spent $52,500, just 21 times 2,500,
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.180]   but he's calculated the value
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.580]   of all the stays he's had at $130,000.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.020]   So, it's definitely possible
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.860]   to get a good deal from the program,
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.820]   but in those 21 months, he's booked 70 nights,
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.440]   which is a lot of travel around the country,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.300]   though, to be fair, 40 of the 70 nights he booked
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.940]   were at one specific property
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.060]   that I think was pretty close to him.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.380]   However, this made me think about the times
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.420]   where I've used my points
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.380]   to book a $10,000 business class flight.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.220]   As much as I love feeling like I got so much value
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.720]   for my points, I'm not sure it's quite fair
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.620]   to call those points being worth $10,000
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.340]   because there is zero chance
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.060]   that I would ever pay $10,000 for a flight
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.760]   if I didn't have the miles.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.120]   So, I wonder how much the guy that writes this site
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.180]   would have spent traveling
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.500]   if he was limited to only booking rentals or resorts,
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.860]   and whether he actually would have spent $130,000
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.140]   or it would have been closer to the $50,000
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.700]   he spent for the pass or even less.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.100]   So, I can't say whether Destination Clubs
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.220]   or the Inspirato Pass is a good option
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.420]   or isn't for some,
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.740]   but I will say that you're gonna need
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.620]   to make a big commitment to travel
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.620]   and want it to be at very high-end properties
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.020]   and need those properties to have room for a lot of people
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.980]   since most of them are larger
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.620]   if you wanna make this worth it.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.300]   I wanna spend an extra minute
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.660]   talking about what I think is the best way
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.140]   to buy a vacation home.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.320]   And as you know, we actually did it for our second home.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.580]   I'm talking about Picasso
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.260]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.340]   So, how does it work?
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.660]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.140]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.820]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.720]   and you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.100]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.020]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.460]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance,
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.120]   bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.620]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us,
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.860]   and within a few days,
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.460]   we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.220]   toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.860]   Since then, it's truly become our second home
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.740]   and has been so amazing.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.840]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.940]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.380]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.300]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.660]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.520]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.540]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.240]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.020]   which means you can see new listings
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.120]   before they go live on the website
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.620]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.500]   P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.620]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.100]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.700]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.140]   in your situation,
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.740]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.020]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.880]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.020]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.120]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.560]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.960]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.920]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.240]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.360]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.720]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.440]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.240]   are first generation wealth,
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.320]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.460]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.800]   and learn from each other
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.400]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.680]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.000]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.440]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.600]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.560]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.040]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.480]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.840]   to your children's education,
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.140]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.600]   So many of these conversations
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.800]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.480]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.360]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.520]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.580]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.720]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,

[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.240]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.040]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.840]   Okay, time for the moment that at least a few of you
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.800]   who wrote in have been waiting for, timeshares.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.640]   So with timeshares, you're purchasing the right
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.360]   to use a property unit for a specified time each year,
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.440]   or in some cases, a specific time or week each year,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.960]   or in some cases, you're buying a timeshare,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.180]   but it's really just a set number of points in a program,
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.600]   which it turns out is called a vacation club.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.500]   Either way, you don't really have any true equity ownership
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.260]   in the underlying real estate,
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.060]   which is probably why the resale values
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.460]   of timeshares is so terrible.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.660]   But it can't be all bad, right?
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.060]   After all, almost 10 million households
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.740]   in the U.S. own a timeshare.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.280]   My grandparents were one of them,
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.100]   and since they've passed, my parents became one too,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.180]   so I've actually gotten a chance to see this
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.120]   from a few perspectives.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.200]   The good perspective was a few trips
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.640]   where our entire extended family went to Hawaii and Mexico
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.200]   and stayed at timeshare properties
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.760]   my grandparents had owned.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.320]   In fact, my grandfather was probably
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.520]   one of the most frugal people I've ever met,
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.380]   so it's hard to imagine timeshares
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.080]   couldn't be a good deal, right?
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.880]   Well, I've done a bunch of digging,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.280]   and if you're okay planning your vacations
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.700]   very far in advance, and you've found a place
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.120]   you wanna keep coming back to for decades to come,
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.720]   and you're not looking for five-star luxury properties,
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.240]   I actually don't know if timeshares
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.820]   are the worst deal out there.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's much less expensive than most of the options
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.440]   we've just talked about,
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.240]   with the average price of a timeshare being $21,455,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.200]   and then a few thousand per year in maintenance fees.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.600]   And I can tell you firsthand
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.680]   that I think my grandparents
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.280]   probably got their money's worth,
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.920]   because for almost 30 years,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.120]   they meticulously used all five or six of their timeshares
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.440]   every single year.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.120]   But after they passed,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.960]   and my mom had to figure out what to do with them,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.680]   we saw the other side.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.400]   Trying to get rid of them was such a challenge.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.940]   None of their children wanted to inherit them,
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.640]   so after failing to sell them for anything,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.340]   or even give them away,
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.460]   my mom actually had to pay the timeshare companies
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.280]   thousands of dollars to take them back.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.520]   So if you believe in market pricing theory,
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.960]   the fact that you can buy so many secondhand timeshares
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.240]   for a tiny fraction of their original purchase price
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.840]   would have to lead you to believe
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.520]   they're either not a good deal,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.680]   or they're a good deal,
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.400]   but if you buy them secondhand, which is called a resale,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.480]   it's an even better deal.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.840]   The deeper I went online,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.560]   the advice was so consistent
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.700]   that if you're really interested in a timeshare,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.160]   you're better to just go rent the places
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.060]   from owners that aren't using them,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.120]   or buy one as a resale from another owner.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.140]   And thanks to sites like Redweek, Tug2, and Go Koala,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.040]   it's never been easier to do those things.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.680]   It's actually so crazy to browse those sites
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   and see hundreds and hundreds of people
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.360]   trying to sell their timeshares for even just $1,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.320]   or some of them will actually pay you
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.560]   to take the timeshare off their hands
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.680]   by prepaying a year or two of maintenance fees.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.120]   But if all that's true,
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.720]   then why have so many millions of Americans bought them new?
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.040]   Well, first off, the sales pitches are so good.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.760]   I'm sure many of you have seen them while traveling
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.200]   or even been to some.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.400]   They usually offer you a gift certificate,
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.120]   a spa treatment, or something to go to a presentation,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.560]   but only if you're married and over 25.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.640]   I know because I've been to a couple,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.800]   and I just wanted to hear the pitch.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.000]   And if you're 100% confident you can walk away,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.800]   then I'd encourage you to check out one of these
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.620]   and just see how it works.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.320]   It's so crazy how good they make the deal sound.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.800]   It's crazy to see the high pressure they put on you
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.080]   to sign on the spot,
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.240]   and the crazy incentives they'll roll out
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.760]   to get you to do that.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.720]   I loved watching it happen,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.080]   but I happily left empty handed each time.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.080]   I probably won't do it again on a whim,
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.840]   but I have gotten these letters from Hyatt and Marriott
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.160]   to go to some decent properties in Mexico and Hawaii.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.000]   And it's like five nights for $400
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.500]   as long as you go to the timeshare presentation.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.560]   Sometimes they even throw in bonus points.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.680]   So I wouldn't be surprised if we end up taking them up
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.540]   on one of those offers in the future,
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.760]   but you can be assured
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.520]   that we are not going to end up with a timeshare.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.960]   But I wanna loop back and cover a few of the nuances
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.600]   and answer a few questions.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.440]   First off,
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.840]   I mentioned you have to wanna come back
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.200]   to the same property,
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.240]   but I'm sure many of you
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.400]   that are familiar with timeshares are thinking,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.040]   "Aren't there so many exchanges
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.680]   either through the timeshare companies
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.440]   or partners like RCI?"
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.420]   And I'll say, "Yes, there are."
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.440]   But they all usually give priority booking
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.420]   to the owners at specific properties.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.960]   So every time we've looked
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.840]   trying to use my parents' timeshare they inherited,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   it's been very, very difficult
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.320]   to get the dates we want
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.840]   in the unit size we want
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.080]   at a property that's worth staying at.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.200]   But that makes sense
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.840]   because my parents are timeshare owners
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.040]   or technically vacation club owners
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.360]   and their ownership is tied
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.400]   to a really nice window in Park City.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.040]   And in order to book the three or four bedroom units
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.080]   they have that we use for our family vacations,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   you literally need to log into the website
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.240]   13 months in advance at 1201 AM
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.320]   and book it before it's gone.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.300]   Otherwise, you almost never get the dates you want
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.520]   unless you get lucky
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.580]   or you happen to be looking right as someone cancels.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.320]   Which brings up another interesting point
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.640]   on the downside of buying timeshares from an existing owner.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.120]   So I know I said that's the advice I got
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.640]   but a lot of these programs
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.760]   especially at the vacation clubs where they're points-based
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.200]   have come up with tiers of status you earn
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.000]   as you buy more annual packages of points.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   So you may have 500,000 points per year
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.840]   but if you buy another 500,000
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.860]   and cross to the 1 million threshold
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.480]   you get an exclusive VIP status
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.160]   that lets you book yet another month
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.660]   before everyone else at certain properties.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.480]   So to make their resales less enticing
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.400]   they only give you that status
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.140]   and those great advanced booking windows
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.440]   when you buy new directly from the property.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.160]   Funny enough, this is actually what happened to my parents.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.400]   So they inherited a bunch of Wyndham points
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.120]   from my grandparents
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.320]   that based on the catalog of properties
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.840]   seemed like a great deal.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.160]   Someone had to take them
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.680]   and we only had to cover the maintenance fees
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.620]   since my grandparents had already paid for them.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.340]   However, we quickly learned that it was just so hard
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.740]   to book the properties you wanted
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.140]   because they were getting snapped up so early.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.300]   So despite years of family stories
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.980]   about how crazy it was
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.380]   that my grandparents were buying all these timeshares
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.300]   my parents went to one of these pitches
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.980]   to get their free gift certificate
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.100]   and left having spent thousands of dollars
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.980]   to get enough points
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.260]   that they crossed that magical million point per year mark
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.720]   and got that extra month to book things
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.360]   before everyone else could.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.480]   And to be fair
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.840]   they've used that to book a four bedroom unit
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.480]   at a place in Park City
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.140]   that's been a fantastic family vacation for us
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.960]   most of the past decade.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.600]   And if you look at what it would cost
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.520]   to rent a four bedroom property in Park City
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.640]   I think the fact that they didn't have to pay
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.060]   for the original amount of timeshare points
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.980]   might've been a good deal.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.800]   But even given all of that
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.280]   they still keep rolling over
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.160]   hundreds of thousands of points each year
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.020]   because they're not using them all.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.060]   And I finally talked to my mom yesterday
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.260]   and she said, if she could go back in time
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.620]   she'd probably have preferred
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.260]   to never taken over the timeshare
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.580]   and certainly wouldn't have bought
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.980]   all those additional points a few years ago.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.460]   So I guess my takeaway on timeshares
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.660]   is that you should definitely do a ton of research
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.740]   on the program you're looking at before you buy anything.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.660]   That means joining the Timeshare user group forums
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.820]   or finding the owners Facebook groups
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.060]   and really trying to make sure
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.700]   you're gonna be able to get the value you want out of this
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.400]   because I can assure you
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.660]   anyone at a resort trying to sell you one of these
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.080]   is gonna make it clear that that value is so easy to get.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.040]   And specifically, I'd try to figure out
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.180]   if there's really anything you'd miss by buying a resale
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.400]   because you can get these resale timeshares
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.480]   for pennies on the dollar.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.580]   And I do think there's some real value
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.320]   to be had on these resales.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.400]   But again, you have to wanna stay at the properties
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.480]   within the timeshare program, many of which
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.420]   but certainly not all are pretty dated.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.140]   Also, if you're considering a timeshare,
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.720]   I would 100% make sure you try out the property first
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.960]   and sites like Go Koala make it so easy
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.300]   to rent other people's timeshares
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.960]   which might make you realize
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.100]   that you can just keep doing that every year
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.900]   and getting a great deal.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.860]   However, I would love to hear from anyone listening right now
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.660]   that has stories or anecdotes around this topic
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.580]   so I can share back what I learned with all of you.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.680]   I can only do so much reading online
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.800]   but it would be great to hear all of your thoughts
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.320]   and experiences as well.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.920]   So, that almost wraps up this vacation home episode
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.220]   but I did wanna share two more quick things
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.040]   that fit in line with the topic.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.720]   Now, there are a lot of reasons to have a vacation home,
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.440]   timeshare, et cetera, but for some people
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.800]   it's because they just wanna go to a nice place
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.480]   maybe with a nice pool or resort amenities.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.880]   And if that's the case,
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.560]   there's actually two interesting companies
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.460]   you should consider checking out.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.760]   The first is Resort Pass which lets you pay
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.680]   to use all the facilities of a resort hotel
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.960]   without actually needing to stay there.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.320]   So, it could be that you're traveling
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.040]   and are saving money by staying at an Airbnb
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.340]   or maybe you even rented one of these timeshare weeks
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.380]   from Gokwala but you just wanna have a nice day
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.620]   at a beautiful pool or float down the lazy river
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.660]   or maybe you don't even wanna take a vacation
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.680]   or maybe you don't even wanna travel that far
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.900]   and you just wanna book a day at a resort close to home.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.200]   I haven't used it before
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.280]   but it's definitely an interesting model
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.480]   and there are a bunch of properties all over the country
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.600]   where you can pay anywhere from $20, $30
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.260]   all the way to $200 to spend the day at.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.120]   The second is Swimply which is kind of like Airbnb
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.820]   but for swimming pools.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.240]   So, when I searched near us, I found six pools
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.000]   within 10 miles that I could rent for 65 to $100 an hour.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.080]   Based on the site, it seems like they're catering
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.140]   towards people who wanna host an event
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.400]   or a birthday party for their kids
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.200]   but compared to the cost of joining some type of gym
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.080]   or club with a pool, adding a pool to your property,
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.520]   staying at a resort or even using resort pass,
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.240]   for the occasional pool day,
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.680]   it's probably a much cheaper option
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.000]   and from their site, it looks like they're gonna expand
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.920]   beyond pools to tennis courts, home gyms,
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.800]   backyards and more.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   As crazy as this might sound to some of you,
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.680]   I've definitely walked by some of our neighbor's houses
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.960]   who've turned their garage into a fully decked out gym
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.340]   and thought if there were some deal we could work out
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.060]   so I could use their gym,
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.180]   which probably sits unused 23 hours a day,
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.760]   I would totally do it.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.940]   So, if you wanna check it out, I created a Swimply account
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.140]   and you can use my referral code to get $25 off
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.240]   at allthehacks.com/swim
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.380]   and if any of you actually use this or resort pass,
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.820]   please let me know what you think
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.100]   and if I get enough referrals,
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.020]   I'll use my credit to book a pool
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.980]   and let you guys know what that experience was like.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.320]   Wow, so I had 14 pages of notes to do this episode
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.580]   and I think I've hit on everything on vacation homes.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.920]   I was actually a bit nervous doing all this research
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.680]   because I went much deeper than I did
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.640]   when we bought our fraction of a vacation home
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.880]   through Picasso and I was a little worried
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.400]   that I would find an alternative
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.600]   and wish that I've done something different.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.520]   However, the opposite happened
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.560]   and I am now actually much more confident
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.960]   we made the right choice
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.800]   and because we're now gone five to six weeks a year
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.480]   at our Picasso in Napa,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.680]   I'm actually thinking maybe we should start listing
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.360]   our primary house on one of the exchange sites
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.320]   and start building up some credits
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.360]   to let us stay in amazing homes on our trips abroad for free.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.200]   So thank you so much for listening.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.480]   I'm curious to hear what you thought about this episode,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.500]   both the content and the idea
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.280]   of doing these solo deep dives more frequently.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.320]   Like I said at the beginning,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.200]   I'm thinking of doing one on insurance,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.440]   credit card benefits and parenting.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.300]   Ideally the parenting one, I'll have Amy join me
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.360]   but if there are any other topics you want me to dig into
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.400]   or maybe there's just things
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.140]   about how I manage my own life you wanna hear more about,
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.400]   please let me know.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.520]   I'm Chris at allthehacks.com.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.880]   I'll see you next week.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.520]   (futuristic music)
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.580]   you
