[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.820]   Well, we have talked about the deadening power
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.240]   of the entertainment age in which we live.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.760]   Just recently, we saw this in APJ 1811,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.820]   and we have talked a lot on this podcast over the years
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.520]   about the flippancy of the age
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   and of how humor and glibness sort of works its way
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.000]   into the language of the church.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.680]   If we're not careful on this point,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.060]   I'm reminded of APJs 328 and 905.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.960]   We address that directly.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   But here's an interesting question about humor
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   from a listener named Brian.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.040]   Hi, Pastor John.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.840]   A question I have wondered about for a while
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.280]   is these commands to Christians in general
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   and requirements for elders specifically
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.680]   that we be sober-minded.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   I see this in texts like 1 Timothy 3, 2,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.800]   and verse 11, 2 Timothy 4, 5,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.320]   Titus 2, 2, 1 Peter 1, 13, 4, 7, 5, 8.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.280]   I ask because my question is about humor.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.000]   My default mode is outgoing and humorous.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.160]   So I've wondered if maybe this is something
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.480]   I must repent of.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.760]   I can understand not wanting to make light of things
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.680]   that are serious or holy,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.880]   but do these commands to be sober-minded
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.800]   mean we should be serious all the time?
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.600]   - There are several different Greek words
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.280]   behind the idea of sober or sober-mindedness.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   The basic idea is either not drunk
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   and all that implies as it applies to our mind.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.200]   And the more general way we use it,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.060]   namely thoughtful, self-controlled,
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.320]   without any reference to drunkenness.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.740]   In both cases, the import is the same.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.540]   A mind that is alert and clear
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.000]   and able to take reality into account
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.140]   for what it really is and process things wisely
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.640]   and draw informed and insightful judgments
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.300]   from what we observe and think about.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.560]   In January of this year, Joe Rigney,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.240]   the president of Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.280]   where I service as chancellor and teach preaching,
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.960]   gave a message in chapel
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.680]   on this very theme of sober-mindedness.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.120]   And I found it very helpful.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.580]   I think you can probably go to the BCS website and find it,
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.020]   but it was really illuminating for me.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.600]   I remember even now,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.100]   he drew out three implications from biblical texts
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.240]   for what sober-mindedness is,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.860]   especially for younger Christians like our students.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.940]   One, clarity of mind.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.900]   Two, stability of soul.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.420]   Three, readiness for action.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.820]   And we can see all three of these features
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.460]   of sober-mindedness if we just look
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.460]   at the three uses of the word in 1 Peter,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.620]   without even going to Paul's letters or anywhere else.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.340]   And then when we look at these,
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.580]   I'll turn around and say something
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.220]   about Brian's particular question
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.160]   about how humor fits into sober-mindedness.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.220]   So first, 1 Peter 1:13,
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.220]   "Preparing your minds for action and being sober-minded,
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.520]   set your hope fully on the grace that is coming to you
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.220]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.380]   So you can hear readiness for action
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.380]   and a clear head that focuses on the hope of Christ
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.260]   rather than being cluttered
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.480]   and confused by worldly distractions.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.780]   Second, 1 Peter 4, 7,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.060]   "The end of all things is at hand,
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.480]   therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.020]   for the sake of your prayers."
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.380]   And you can hear the need for stability of soul
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.380]   because of how fraught with instability
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.780]   the end times will be.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.780]   People easily fall prey to hysteria and conspiracy thinking
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.260]   and lose their footing and their stability.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.440]   So don't do that.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.240]   Be sober-minded for the end of all things is at hand.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.320]   And third, 1 Peter 5, 8,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   "Be sober-minded, be watchful.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.660]   Your adversary, the devil, prowls around
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.200]   like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour."
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.860]   And you can hear the call for alertness to lion prowling
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.360]   and a readiness to act in defense of your soul
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   against this lion and the need for stability of soul
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.600]   because living with a constant awareness
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.240]   that we have a supernatural enemy
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   could easily throw us off balance that we could lose.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.640]   And we need very much to think straight and clear
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.080]   and biblically about our adversary
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   and not lose our bearings or our soul's stability.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   President Rigney went on then to make application
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.140]   to the particular challenges of our culture
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.260]   which are remarkably pressing today.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.760]   And sober-mindedness turns out to be really in short supply
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.420]   and really needed, he argued.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.940]   And I think he's right.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.540]   And you can check that out for yourself.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.160]   But Brian's question is different.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.640]   He says, "My question is about humor.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.640]   My default mode is pretty outgoing and humorous.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.660]   So I have wondered if maybe this is something
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.140]   I must repent of.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.400]   I can understand not wanting to make light of things
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.140]   that are serious or holy,
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.140]   but does the command to be sober-minded mean
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.900]   we should be serious all the time?"
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.560]   Close quote.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   Interesting question.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.980]   I gotta define some terms here.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.080]   I wonder if when Brian uses the word serious,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.140]   he might mean in his assumptions,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.140]   something like somber or dour or glum
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.320]   or the weighty look of the furrowed brow
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.880]   that you bring into every situation.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.780]   If he does mean that by serious,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.780]   then the answer is no.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.860]   Sober-mindedness does not imply that.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.520]   But the way I use the word serious is this.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   Its opposite is silliness, not joy.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.900]   Silliness is the opposite of serious.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.900]   Immaturity, trifling, frivolous, flippant, petty,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   those are the opposite of serious in my vocabulary.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.520]   And I think sober-mindedness does prevent
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.240]   that kind of trifling humor.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.760]   Sober-mindedness is the demeanor that corresponds
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.120]   to the weight of the things of life,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.480]   the great things of life.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.540]   It is possible to be sober-minded
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.640]   and have elements of humor in our life,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.620]   but it's hard to be sober-minded and at the same time,
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.840]   be the kind of person that we've all met
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.440]   who is obsessed with being funny.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   So obsessed, he is incapable of serious moments.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.800]   He is actually allergic.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.040]   I've known people like this.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.680]   They are allergic to serious moments.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.400]   If a serious moment starts to happen,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.300]   they're the first to break the mood
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.100]   with some pun or something.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.580]   They can't take it.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.380]   They gotta say something quick to break
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.780]   what they consider a seriousness
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.060]   that they don't know what to do with.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.520]   They're just emotionally incapable of relaxing
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.200]   and enjoying seriousness.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.940]   And that's what I would warn Brian against.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.820]   You don't wanna be that way.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.640]   On the other hand, unbroken seriousness
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.080]   of a melodramatic or somber kind
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.400]   inevitably communicates a sickness of soul
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.920]   to the great mass of people.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.440]   And they're right.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.480]   This is partly because life as God created it
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.600]   is not like that.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.080]   There are, for example, little babies in the world
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.920]   who are not the least impressed with our passion.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.220]   (laughs)
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.140]   Or my zeal or my sober looks.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.720]   They are cooing and smiling and calling for their daddies
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.800]   to get down on the floor and play with them.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.060]   And the daddy who cannot do this,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.380]   'cause he's so serious,
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.420]   will not understand the true seriousness of sin
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.260]   because he's not capable of enjoying
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.980]   what God has preserved from his ravages.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   He's really a sick man
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.760]   and unfit to lead others into health.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.960]   He is in the end sober-minded about being sober-minded,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.420]   not sober-minded about being joyful.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.160]   The real battle in life
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.880]   is to be as happy in God as we can be.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   And that takes a very special kind of sober-mindedness.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.820]   It is significant, isn't it,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.820]   that the first use of sober-mindedness in 1 Peter 1.13
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.020]   puts it in the service of hope.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.020]   Be sober-minded, set your hope fully on grace
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.620]   that is coming to you,
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.940]   being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.780]   What could be happier, right?
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.000]   What could be happier than hope?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.260]   Put your sober-mindedness to work
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260]   for making sure that you remain hopeful
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.420]   and joyful as a Christian.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.660]   That's the great task of sober-mindedness.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.380]   So Brian, there's no conflict
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.460]   between sober-mindedness and joy at all.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.360]   This is real joy, strong joy, stable joy,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.060]   spiritually alert joy, ready to act joy.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.900]   If your humor serves that,
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.300]   then praise God and go for it.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.140]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.580]   And great question, Brian.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.820]   And to find that Joe Rigney sermon,
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.220]   I just found it on YouTube by searching for the title,
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.140]   simply titled "Sober-Mindedness,"
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.840]   a sermon published there on January 26th, 2022.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.040]   Okay, so we are talking about the place of humor,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.560]   and that leads us to ask about the tenor of public worship.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.980]   How do we frame the gravity of our worship
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.180]   so flippant humor doesn't become the default vibe
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.460]   of our corporate worship?
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.740]   That question is up next time.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.580]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke,
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.460]   and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.460]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:41.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
