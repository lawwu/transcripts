[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700]   Well, we now get over 1,200 emails a month from listeners.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.860]   Thank you for those emails and please keep them coming into us.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.300]   And of course, we got a few emails related to the Nashville statement, which was a public
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.680]   document that you signed, Pastor John, and it was on human sexuality.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180]   But we actually only got 10 emails about that statement in total.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.180]   Interesting.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.340]   And most of those emails were sympathetic.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.860]   By far, the most articulate pushback that we got came from a listener named Amy in this
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.860]   email.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.860]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.460]   Thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.180]   I'm sure you're aware of the criticism surrounding the Nashville statement released back in August,
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.740]   both from outside of the church, but also from within the evangelical world too.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.100]   It created quite a stir.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.140]   I know of faithful Orthodox Reformed church planters and pastors working in larger metropolitan
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.460]   contexts, who find this statement unhelpful, even as the document contains affirmations
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.180]   and denials that are completely true, biblical, and agreeable to them.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.140]   It seems to be a matter of two related questions.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.340]   Number one, is hot topic orthodoxy announced and affirmed in the wide open public realm
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.620]   appropriate in a casting pearls before swine kind of a way?
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.540]   And number two, is it helpful or harmful for outreach to draw public lines in the sand
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.700]   over ideology, which at worst is seen to be politically motivated by the world, or is
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.060]   at least something that adds a new wall of separation between the Christians in a local
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.540]   church from the liberal unbelieving neighbors they are trying to reach within a neighborhood,
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.140]   first through relationship building?
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.340]   I hope this makes sense.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.620]   Do either questions concern you?"
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.740]   Maybe just a response to each of her two questions.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.180]   And the second one, really, I hear two questions in the second, so maybe three things to respond
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.460]   to, even though there's so much more that could be said, and I'll just mention that
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.900]   at the end maybe.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.700]   But she's asked her two questions, I'll try to be faithful to those two questions,
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.660]   rather than talking about things I would like to talk about as well.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.620]   There's so many criticisms, so many things need to be said.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.460]   Yes, the questions do concern me, because all questions that relate to serious dissensions
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.620]   among brothers and sisters concern me.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.620]   So first, I don't think Jesus' statement in Matthew 7:6, "Do not give dogs what is
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.540]   holy, do not throw your pearls before pigs or swine, lest they trample them underfoot
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.100]   and turn to attack you."
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.580]   I don't think that verse was intended by Jesus to limit the public preaching of the
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.180]   whole counsel of God.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.260]   So think with me about that for just a minute.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.060]   What is the best pearl we have?
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.060]   The best pearl that we have is the preaching of the gospel of Christ crucified.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.480]   Christ crucified for sinners, risen from the dead, received by faith for the forgiveness
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.620]   of sins, for the hope of eternal life and power to walk in holiness.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.420]   It's the rock-solid core of gospel preaching.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.860]   That's the sweetest pearl, the most beautiful pearl that we have to offer the world.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.540]   And what the New Testament makes clear is that every time that precious pearl is preached,
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.180]   it will be both believed and reviled.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.100]   It is the aroma, Paul says, from life to life, so believed, and death to death.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.280]   People hate it, and they die because they hate it.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.440]   It brings out sheep-like faith, and it brings out swine-like trampling.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.640]   Both effects happen when Jesus preached the pearl and when Paul preached the pearl, and
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.400]   both effects happen when we preach the pearl.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.840]   The pearl will always be found as precious by some and utterly offensive by others.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.080]   So since that's always the case, and since Jesus and Paul acted that way in spite of
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.320]   the fact that that's the case, I don't think Jesus meant that we shouldn't put precious
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.880]   pearls before the public where they might be trampled, which they always will be.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.080]   Some will pick them up and love them and die for them, and others will stomp on them.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.760]   Here's what I think Jesus meant.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.920]   I think an example of what he meant is found in Matthew 21, 27, where Jesus was asked,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.680]   "By what authority do you do these things?"
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.540]   And Jesus didn't like their attitude.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.760]   They were very devious, and so he asked them a question, "By whose authority was John
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.160]   the Baptist's baptism?" and so on.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.120]   And they're so devious that they conspire together to lie and say they don't know,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.400]   when in fact they do know.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.360]   They know what they think, and they're just politicking with Jesus.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   And Jesus refuses to answer them in Matthew 21, 27.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   "I won't talk to you.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.640]   I don't talk to that kind of people."
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.040]   He wouldn't give them the pearl.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.380]   He wouldn't cast the pearl before these rascals because he saw that they had just revealed
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.880]   how devious their whole conversation was in dealing with him.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.380]   That's all they meant to do was trample.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.600]   They weren't eager to hear the truth at all.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.280]   They're trying to trap him.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.960]   So behind Amy's question, however, I think is the question, "Is the Christian vision
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.420]   of covenant-keeping marriage between a man and a woman and Christ-dependent chastity
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:04.280]   among homosexuals or heterosexuals, people who have same-sex attraction and people who
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.160]   don't, is that vision of covenant-keeping marriage between a man and a woman and Christ-dependent
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.400]   chastity outside marriage, is that a beautiful pearl that should be held up for the world
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.220]   to know and possibly by grace admire?"
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:30.320]   With the implication that distortions of the pearl and attacks on the pearl are inevitable,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.660]   just like they have always been.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.860]   And I think the Christian vision of creation as male and female and marriage as a covenant-keeping
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.660]   lifelong bond between a man and a woman, a husband and a wife, and courageous Christ-exalting
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:55.980]   chastity outside marriage, or in marriage for that matter, are a beautiful pearl that
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:03.900]   should be set on a pedestal before the world, even knowing that today many in the world
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:12.020]   hate this pearl, mock this pearl, do everything they can to trample on and shatter this pearl.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.260]   But that leads to the second question that Amy has, because they really are all linked
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.780]   together.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:26.980]   Her language inclines me to think that she may not have the same view of this pearl that
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.980]   I do.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.420]   I don't know.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:41.180]   She wonders whether lines should be drawn in the sand over, quote, "ideology," which
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.980]   at worst is seen as politically motivated by the world.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.300]   Now I'm not sure what she means by the word "ideology."
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:00.340]   It sounds like a category of thinking which is not part of important Christian pearls,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:07.400]   Christian revelation that the world needs, and not part of a beautiful pearl.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.460]   So I'm not sure what she would include in "ideology."
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:22.260]   The fact that the world will see public statements, public articles or blogs, public preaching,
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:28.540]   which all preaching is, the fact that the world will see all the statements, all the
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:37.020]   articles, all the preaching about human sexuality today as politically motivated, which it will,
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:44.060]   surely cannot be the criterion of the faithfulness of our preaching or our article writing or
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.700]   our public statements.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.660]   Such accusations of being politically motivated will always be the case.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.800]   There will always be people who twist what you say to have connotations and implications
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.940]   that you don't want them to have and you didn't intend.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.340]   That's exactly the way people treated the preaching of Jesus.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.460]   Remember when they said that he's going to tear down the temple?
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.940]   That's pretty political.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.940]   Well, he didn't.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.940]   They're twisting his words, right?
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.300]   They're not finding a legitimate complaint.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:26.740]   In other words, he was accused of speaking with political motivation, and this conflict
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.820]   was not marginal.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.980]   It was public, and it got him killed.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.100]   It got him killed.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:43.860]   And yet, he said the very controversial words he knew would get him in that kind of trouble.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.540]   And it was the same with Paul's preaching, according to 2 Peter 3, where people are twisting,
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.620]   they're just twisting what Paul has to say.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.980]   It will always be the case.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:05.020]   If someone thinks that there's a way to preach and write and make statements and do anything
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:11.260]   else in public that presents the pearls of biblical truth without encountering in the
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:18.420]   social media and other ways a thousand angry critics, they're just naive.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.420]   It cannot be done.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.860]   Let me say this as strongly as I know how.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:31.780]   The day is long gone in America where it is possible to be publicly faithful as a Christian
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.980]   to the truth of God and not be excoriated.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.780]   I'm going to read again.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:47.180]   The day is long gone in America where it is possible to be publicly faithful as a Christian
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.620]   to the truth of the Bible and not be excoriated.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:57.460]   Jesus said, "You will be hated by all nations, and you can pick any part of the biblical
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.940]   truth you want, and it will be true."
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:09.380]   The second part of Amy's second question wonders whether the Nashville statement "adds a new
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:16.140]   wall of separation between the Christians in a local church and the liberal unbelieving
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.020]   neighbors that they are trying to reach."
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:30.020]   And my answer to that is, no, I don't think anything has been added—there's a key word—added
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:36.940]   to what separates Bible-believing people from non-Bible-believing people.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:44.940]   Of course the Nashville statement makes explicit the difference between what the world regards
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:54.580]   as a pearl and what Bible-believers regard as a pearl—indeed, what most of the world
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.620]   has regarded as a pearl for the entire history of humankind.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.900]   And I would just appeal—this is really a personal appeal, and take it for what it's
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:11.380]   worth, I hope folks who are resistant to the Nashville statement for various reasons will
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.380]   at least listen carefully.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:20.020]   I would just appeal to those whose method of evangelism, or being missional as we say
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:29.820]   today, includes the effort to conceal offensive biblical things about the pearl of the Christian
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:43.260]   life, that those folks may not only be missing golden opportunities for biblical witness
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:53.620]   precisely because offensive things are out in the public, but they may also be abandoning
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.980]   the way Jesus and the apostles did their public ministry.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.300]   Let me say a word about each of those concerns that I have.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:08.980]   Might it not be God's design that at school, or in the office, or at the gym, when people
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:18.420]   are fuming about the Nashville statement or anything like it, you insightfully—this
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:26.100]   is God's design—it could be God's design that you insightfully and creatively and courageously
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.220]   and joyfully show them, start where they are in their fuming, and show them that these
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:39.460]   true statements, which Amy says are true, these true statements in fact are beautiful.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.680]   This is a beautiful pearl.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:49.380]   The real challenge is not to make Jesus look beautiful by hiding some of his cherished
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.380]   convictions.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:57.260]   The real challenge is to trace all his views, including his most offensive ones, back to
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.620]   the beautiful root of his person and up to the beautiful flower of his glory and his
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.540]   purposes for all of mankind.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.620]   That's the challenge we may be missing by huffing and puffing about how controversial
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.300]   things are.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:18.860]   And we really must ask ourselves—this is a broader concern I have that seems to be
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.840]   between the lines here—we really must ask ourselves whether Jesus and the apostles did
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:33.080]   their missional evangelistic work in a way that beautiful but controversial teachings
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.180]   were concealed.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.620]   Crowds were listening to Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:48.060]   Crowds, crowds of people, hearing him, no doubt, for the first time, many of them.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.860]   Not a select group, a little in-house group that can handle hard things.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.540]   And he said that being angry is like murder and it'll send you to hell.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.720]   And he said lust is like adultery and it'll send you to hell.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   Those are his words.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.480]   Those are the strongest words in the Bible about hell.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.840]   He said the gate is narrow that leads to life and few there be that find it.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.280]   He said the tree that doesn't bear fruit is going to get cut down and thrown into the
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   fire.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.300]   And he was saying this to people who were, "Whoa, who is this?
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.900]   Who is this talking like that?"
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:36.460]   They're all incredibly offensive words spoken to the crowds.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:43.060]   When people wanted to follow Jesus, he told them, "You sure?
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.380]   Can you build this tower?
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.120]   Can you defeat this army?
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.680]   Can you live without a home?"
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.420]   He told them to count the cost.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.580]   He didn't try to make it.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.600]   He didn't hide anything.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.720]   He didn't try to conceal the cost.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.300]   And when Paul preached to Felix, Felix said, "You're out of your mind!"
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.240]   And Paul didn't say, "Wow, I must have blown it.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.960]   My evangelistic missional strategy has just made me useless."
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.360]   He said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.840]   I am speaking the truth in rational words, and you know I am."
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:30.400]   Oh my, there is just so much more to say in regard to the Nashville Statement.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.960]   Things that need to be said about Donald Trump and the moral compromise of evangelicals who
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.680]   minimized his unrepentant lechery, things that need to be said about a rampant divorce
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.720]   culture in and outside the church, things that need to be said about evangelical contrition
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.640]   for aiding and abetting the collapse of sexual immorality, and on and on.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.880]   And I've already gone on way too long for a podcast like this, so what I just wanted
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.080]   to do is take Amy's two questions and try to be faithful to them.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.360]   Maybe we can do more later.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   Amen.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.720]   There are loads of ethical connections to the Nashville Statement and to popular sexual
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.400]   trends and beliefs within evangelicalism today, and much more needs to be said.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.560]   Thank you, Pastor John, for at least saying this.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.760]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your week.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.680]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive, and even
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.440]   reach us by email with a question of your own, even questions that relate to cultural
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.720]   hot topics and how the church best engages in those conversations in public, like this
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.560]   very good question today from Amy.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:47.440]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.240]   Well Jesus is our ransom.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   Amen to that.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.840]   Christ gave himself as a ransom for all, scripture says.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.960]   But who did he ransom?
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.240]   Who got paid off by his shed blood?
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.800]   This question is super important and is far too often answered wrongly.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.400]   It's going to be a good one.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.160]   We'll see you then.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:08.780]   Amen.
