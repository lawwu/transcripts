[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Well, God's glory and our joy are interlinked together.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.360]   C.S. Lewis saw it.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.320]   But he also seemed to say that the penny would drop on this connection for most Christians
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.240]   on the other side of eternity.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.000]   In other words, most Christians will not clearly comprehend Christian hedonism in this life,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.520]   even though it's true.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.920]   So would C.S. Lewis say there are laborers at DG are premature?
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.520]   It's a question from Daniel, "Dear Pastor John, thank you for your ministry.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.400]   You've spoken in the past of the prosperity gospel as over realized eschatology, promised
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.000]   physical blessings being part of our inheritance in Christ, but incorrectly assumed to be for
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.880]   today, not the future life.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.880]   I'd like to raise the same objection about Christian hedonism.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.800]   Is it not the case that just as the prosperity gospel is an over realized physical materialistic
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.960]   eschatology, this attempt to find full satisfaction in God in this life also demonstrates over
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.880]   realized emotional psychological eschatology?"
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.080]   C.S. Lewis seems to make such a conclusion himself in the reflections on the Psalms in
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   Speaking of Heaven.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.560]   He writes, "The Scottish catechism says that man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.480]   him forever.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.120]   But we shall then know in heaven that these are the same thing.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.960]   Fully to enjoy is to glorify."
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   So what would you say to criticisms that Christian hedonism reaches prematurely for an over realized
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.040]   emotional or psychological eschatology not intended for our common life until eternity?
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.880]   Wow.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.040]   This is a tremendously insightful and important question, and it gives me great encouragement,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:03.800]   because it means that there are people out there who are thinking seriously and practically
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.680]   and biblically about Christian hedonism.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   So I have four responses to this concern, namely that Christian hedonism is calling
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:25.000]   for a full satisfaction in God and is thus guilty of an over realized eschatology that
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.560]   claims for the Christian life in this world what it can only have in the life to come.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.920]   That's the charge, and I'm going to argue innocent.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.080]   That's number one.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.840]   It may be that some people represent Christian hedonism in an unrealistic way that claims
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.780]   too much for this life, and it may be that in my preaching I have overstated those experiences
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.280]   in a careless way.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.240]   Sometimes, I don't know.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.320]   I don't have a good memory like that.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.820]   But I have spoken on this so often, I would not doubt that somewhere along the way I may
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:09.520]   have misspoken, even though I try very hard to choose my words carefully, both on APJ
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.840]   and in preaching and writing.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.840]   So yes, it is possible to demand more of a Christian in this world emotionally and psychologically
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.040]   and spiritually than God has ordained to give, and thus define what it means to be a Christian
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   in a way that rules some people out who should be in.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   It's certainly possible, and oh, do I want to avoid it.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.320]   The reason we should avoid it is because 1 John 3, 1-2 says that we won't be complete
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.040]   until we see Jesus face to face.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.320]   Paul says in Romans 7 and in Galatians 5 that the flesh and the spirit are at war with each
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.000]   other, often frustrating our desire to love Christ supremely and act consistently with
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   that love.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.740]   Philippians 4 says that Paul has learned the secret of contentment, implying there's
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.180]   been growth and a process of becoming more content along the way as he grows up into
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.800]   Christ rather than an instantaneous perfection of joy or pleasure or contentment at the front
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.480]   end of the Christian life.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.880]   Paul tells us in Romans 8-13 to "put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit, and those
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.760]   sinful deeds arise from" where?
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.960]   Sinful preferences in the heart where Christ does not have the place in our emotions that
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.880]   he ought to have?
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.200]   All of that is why I wrote a book entitled "When I Don't Desire God, How to Fight
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:48.680]   for Joy," and in that book there's a chapter called "When the Darkness Does Not Lift,"
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.920]   dealing with depression.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.160]   So whatever others may do with Christian hedonism, I don't know how anyone could read that book
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.920]   about all of Christian life being a battle to get the joy we don't have and should have
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.200]   and think it's an over-realized eschatology.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.320]   Response number two is to point to the central summary of Christian hedonism.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.120]   God - here's what it's not.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   Let me misquote myself.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:26.040]   It is not "God is fully" or "God is perfectly glorified in us when we are fully and perfectly
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.040]   satisfied in Him."
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.160]   I never say that.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.320]   In a sense it's true, but it's going to happen in heaven, so I don't talk about it.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.280]   It's not my point.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   Daniel points out, C.S. Lewis sees the same thing, and I want to say perhaps C.S. Lewis
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.320]   should have spoken with greater precision, at least the way Daniel quotes him, because
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.000]   what he says is, "Fully to enjoy is to glorify."
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.360]   Hmm.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.940]   Probably he meant, "Fully to enjoy is to glorify fully."
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.480]   I doubt that C.S. Lewis meant - and I'm sure he didn't, in fact, given other things he
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.160]   says - I doubt that he meant the only glory God gets from our enjoyment of God is the
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.440]   glory He gets when our joy is total, complete, full, perfect.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440]   No!
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.880]   Lewis doesn't think that.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.760]   Whatever Lewis meant, that's not what I mean in the summary of Christian hedonism.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   What I say is, "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him," and I
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.560]   think that kind of wording pretty clearly implies that there is a gradation in levels
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.920]   of satisfaction and a gradation in levels of glorification, and the more you are satisfied
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:55.100]   in God, the more He is glorified in you, as when I say, for example, "This meal will be
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.300]   most enjoyed when you are most hungry."
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.700]   And what I mean is, the hungrier you are, the better it tastes.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.180]   I don't have some absolute ideal of hunger in mind that will make the meal perfectly
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.460]   enjoyable.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.900]   The point of summarizing Christian hedonism by saying, "God is most glorified in us when
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:24.780]   we are most satisfied in Him," is to communicate that pursuing satisfaction in God is absolutely
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.500]   essential to the Christian life that glorifies God.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.420]   It's a way of communicating, "Never, never, never, never, never be indifferent to the
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:43.140]   stagnation of your heart toward Christ, because as your satisfaction in Him diminishes, your
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.580]   capacities to glorify Him in your heart diminish.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.820]   And as your capacities to delight in Him and be satisfied in Him and rejoice in Him and
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:58.140]   treasure Him in your heart increase, the more you glorify Him in your heart."
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   There is no unrealistic, absolute ideal of perfection or satisfaction expected in this
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.140]   life.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.140]   That's not what I'm about.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.900]   That's not what Christian hedonism says.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:16.540]   That comes, that perfection, that perfect satisfaction comes when we see Christ face
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.540]   to face.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:26.980]   But there is a radical, absolute, indispensable claim and call from God to us, "Don't be
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.580]   indifferent to your heart's satisfaction in God.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.940]   God gets glory from your heart's joy in Him.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.740]   Seek its increase.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:45.620]   Always seek its increase, because He is most glorified in you when you are most satisfied
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.620]   in Him."
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.500]   Response number three.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.940]   What Jesus Himself said is what I try to say.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.580]   Jesus said, "Whoever loves mother or father more than Me is not worthy of Me, and whoever
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.580]   loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me."
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:07.360]   This is Jesus' way of saying, "If you are not most satisfied in Me compared to others,
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.940]   if your affections are not most attached to Me over against your children and parents,
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.940]   you're not Mine."
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.820]   And He said the same thing, in other words, in Luke 14:33.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:29.740]   "Anyone of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be My disciple."
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.380]   Now we know that doesn't mean you have to be poverty-stricken.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:42.500]   It means your heart has to be on Christ more than on anything else.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.540]   And He said other things like this, "Loving God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,"
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.580]   and "Valuing the treasure hidden in a field so that you're willing to sell everything
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   you have with joy."
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:59.700]   Now, in view of all the other things that Jesus said, I would add this to those radical
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.900]   sayings to protect ourselves against over-realized eschatology.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.300]   I would add this.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.900]   The heart of the Christian often slips from the position of superior delight in Jesus
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.940]   over family and things.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.180]   It does.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.740]   It slips.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:23.500]   Those slippings which give rise to outward sins—that's where sins come from—are
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.660]   not necessarily evidences that we are not born again.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.780]   Provision is made for repentance and forgiveness.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:42.460]   But if our hearts settle in to a position where Christ is highly esteemed and cherished
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:52.900]   and loved, but only in second place, only in third place, that settling in will prove
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.460]   to be evidence we are not Christians.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.700]   And that affection for Jesus may be very high.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.180]   Here's my fourth response.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:11.900]   I believe there is in the newest, most immature, conflicted, baby believer the seed of God's
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.300]   supreme value above all things.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:24.100]   And he has tasted and enjoyed that, even if a new believer can't put that into words.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:35.940]   And one mark of that new believer's ongoing reality as a Christian is the indestructible,
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:43.660]   though variable—here I'm choosing my words as carefully as I know how—the indestructible,
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:54.540]   though variable desire that this seed become a soul-encompassing tree.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:05.340]   For those four reasons, I find Christian hedonism innocent of the charge of over-realized eschatology.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:12.340]   So, I'm going to leave you with a couple of questions that I've been asking myself
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.340]   the past few weeks.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:50.340]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:13:10.100]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:17.100]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   I'm going to start with a question that I've been asking myself.
