[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   What is the relationship between fasting and growth hormone release?
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.280]   I find this really interesting.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.320]   Fasting certainly potently increases growth hormone release.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.760]   However, the end-binding to the receptor is less sensitive.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.040]   So although fasting does increase growth hormone,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.240]   the genes that are downstream to it,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.760]   both the growth hormone genes and IGF-1-related gene transcription activity
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.040]   will not be significantly higher.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.040]   However, if you are optimizing the growth hormone
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.800]   that is released as pulsatile secretion,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.360]   it is helpful to avoid eating for two hours.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.440]   So the general rule of thumb is avoid eating about two hours before bed.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.040]   I think that's clinically significant and helpful,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.960]   but fasting otherwise specifically for growth hormone optimization
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.200]   in someone who already has normal growth hormone signaling is not helpful.
