[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   >> Andrea, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I struggle a lot with
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   having a negative body image based on an internalized cultural ideal that I've had ever since I
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.920]   can remember.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.840]   What does inner beauty really mean from a Christian perspective?"
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.680]   >> She's so right to represent thousands of women who I think are hurt and infected by what they
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.160]   see on endless advertisements, endless TV shows where women are presented with amazingly
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:53.440]   consistent expectations that external savvy, external strength, external cool, external beauty,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.520]   external sexiness are the norm, and oh, how we need to help these women fight the fight of letting
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.760]   God speak to them as powerfully as the world speaks to them.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.480]   So the Bible really, really does address this question, cares a lot about it.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.360]   And let me just take one passage and answer her question, "What is inner beauty?"
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.800]   from it.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.400]   This is 1 Peter 3, 3 through 6.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.840]   Pretty clear answer, I think, in these four verses.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.360]   So let me just start reading and make some comments.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   "Do not let your adorning be external."
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.400]   Talking to the wives here.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.040]   "Do not let your adorning be external, the braiding of hair, the putting on of gold jewelry,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.920]   or the clothing you wear."
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.080]   Now, stop right there and notice this is really crucial.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.840]   He's not talking about particular kinds of hairdos or particular kinds of jewelry being the
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.920]   problem.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.120]   We know that because he says, "Don't let clothing be your outer beauty."
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.280]   Well, he doesn't mean don't wear clothing.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.400]   You've got to wear clothing.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.080]   So when he says, "Don't let your adorning be the clothing you wear," he doesn't mean
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.240]   stop wearing it, like you'd stop wearing a certain hairdo or certain jewelry or clothing.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.200]   He means, "Don't let your clothing be your focus here.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.000]   Don't put your main energy there on the clothing.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.920]   Put your main energy inside."
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.800]   So I would love to free women from this.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.720]   It seems to me that some put so much energy and so much time into their hair and their
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.480]   eyes and their clothes, and it seems very sad to me.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.000]   And I think I can say with a pretty high degree of certainty, it isn't worth the effort.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.320]   Simple hair, simple makeup or none, and simple clothing are generally more attractive than
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.360]   heavily made-up faces and hair.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.760]   But let's go right to the heart of the matter.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.980]   Verse 4, "Let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.400]   beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit, which is in God's sight very precious."
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.640]   Now notice, let me just draw out four things from that amazing sentence.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   Verse 4, 1 Peter 3, "Let your adorning be the hidden person."
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.960]   So this means hidden from men, but open and clear to God.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.040]   This means that your concern should be with, it should be how you appear to God, not to
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040]   people.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.320]   Excessive concern with outward beauty means that we're enthralled with the wrong audience.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   Hidden.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.760]   It's supposed to be hidden, only seen by God.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.600]   Now it's going to bear external fruit.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.720]   Behavior will be affected by these inner qualities, but that's not the focus.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.480]   It will bear fruit, but right now it's hidden.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   That's number one.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.880]   Notice number two, "Let your adorning be the hidden person."
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.160]   What you want to pursue, what we all want to pursue is being a kind of person, not presenting
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.360]   a kind of persona.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:24.040]   What a tragedy to give our lives to painting a mask, a persona, and neglect the person
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.160]   that's inside and real.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.960]   The persona is just, it's artificial.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   It's only what people see on the outside.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.280]   The real you is not your face.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.660]   The real you is the hidden person.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.800]   It's being a person.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.600]   It's an awesome thing to be a person, person in the image of God, a person, not a mannequin,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.800]   a person, not a model, a person, not a doll.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.840]   We shouldn't treat ourselves like dolls and mannequins.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.800]   It's a glorious thing to be a person.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.320]   That's where our energy should go.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   That's number two.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   Number three, "Let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart."
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.680]   What's the heart?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.960]   The heart is the seed of the affections and the will.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.720]   That's who you are most deeply.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.920]   The body is always a presentation of the heart, never the other way around.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.460]   God has a heart that is affections and will from all eternity.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.640]   God never had a body until the incarnation.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.960]   He was glorious because he had a heart that was perfect and beautiful.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.520]   So when we have a heart and we cultivate a heart, we're akin to ultimate reality.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.960]   Bodies came later.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.120]   They're not the essence.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.520]   They display the essence.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.360]   So the heart is the essence.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.360]   That's number three.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   Here's number four.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.440]   "Let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty."
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.000]   One of the reasons God prizes this beauty so highly is that it lasts forever.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   It's called imperishable.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   The body, it gets old.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.200]   All the makeup we work on, it's just not going to work eventually.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.800]   Our beauty is going to fade away, whereas the heart can get more and more beautiful.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.400]   God delights in it because it lasts forever.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.480]   And I guess I said there were four.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.680]   Here's one more.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.080]   "The imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit," which in God's sight is very
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   precious.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:27.600]   Now, why is gentleness, meekness, tranquility, quietness, why is that so precious to God?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   And I think the text tells us why.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.520]   I mean, if I could just think of it out of myself, I would say, well, it's because it
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.320]   reveals that we're restfully trusting in God.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.640]   We're hoping in God, not in man.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.000]   We're trusting in God, and that's why we have peace and we can be meek and tranquil and
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.580]   quiet and not troubled, not anxious, not fretful or frantic.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.600]   So it's beautiful to God because when a woman has a peaceful soul, not fretting about how
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.980]   she looks, it shows that God is her portion and she's banking on God.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.120]   And that's right there in verse five.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:11.960]   It says this, "For this is how the holy women of old hoped in God and used to adorn themselves."
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.800]   So hoping in God produces this quality, and that's why God finds it so beautiful and so
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   precious.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.720]   And that's the audience we really, really want to please.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.040]   And here's one more word from the text.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.800]   The reason meekness and quietness and serenity and these hope-filled attributes of inner
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.960]   beauty count so with God is because they make a woman fearless.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.640]   See, I don't want to close, Tony, in leaving the impression that these words meekness and
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.140]   quietness and tranquility somehow produce a pansy.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.640]   These women are lionhearted because this is what it says.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:01.160]   You are Sarah's children if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.360]   I mean, that's the kind of woman you want, right?
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:12.060]   A kind of woman who's quiet, peaceful, serene, meek, fearless, bold, not frightened in anything.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:18.000]   My guess is the woman who gets up in the morning, spends endless hours on her face and worries
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.360]   about her figure is frightened all the time.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.320]   She's very insecure.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.840]   But we want mighty women of the Word, mighty women of God who are fearless.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.560]   And that comes from hoping in God, and that comes from cultivating this inner beauty.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.480]   And so I just would love to be a means of rescuing people from, I mean, women from a
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.040]   lot of wasted time and wasted effort.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   Excellent.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.700]   And while we're on this topic, we have two Ask Pastor John episodes from last spring
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.440]   that are both worth noting here.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.400]   Episode 65 is titled "What is Strong Feminine Womanhood?"
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.860]   And episode 66 is titled "Wimpy Theology Makes Wimpy Women."
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.160]   Both episodes celebrate strong, godly women who fear God.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.900]   And in both episodes, we relive a couple of classic John Piper sermon moments.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.280]   So be sure to check out episodes 65 and 66 in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive and
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.120]   listen all the way to the end of those episodes for the good stuff.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.920]   Those episodes and 268 others can be found in the free Ask Pastor John apps for the iPhone
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.400]   and Android, and be sure you've updated your app in the last month to get all the new features
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.520]   that make it really easy to search and browse those episodes.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.720]   Have a wonderful weekend.
