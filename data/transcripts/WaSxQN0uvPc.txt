[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Today's question is from a listener named Elliot.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.720]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.720]   Would you say there's such a thing as a Christian being too harsh with themselves?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.480]   I'm often told by others in my secular job that I'm too hard on myself.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.820]   Recently, my wife has mentioned several times that the standards of excellence I try to
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.600]   achieve at church are too high.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.180]   I don't deliberately view life or myself like this, but wouldn't low standards lead to acceptance
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.180]   of sin in our lives?
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.560]   I guess more generally, my question is this.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.560]   Is it possible for a Christian to be too hard on himself?"
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:49.840]   Since I don't know the details of what being hard on himself looks like, I'm going to address
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.920]   this issue in principle like this.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.240]   What might it mean to be too hard on oneself in regard to justification, and what might
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.080]   it mean to be too hard on oneself in regard to sanctification, and what might be some
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.160]   guidelines to help us be appropriately hard on ourselves, but not too hard on ourselves,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.900]   not sinfully hard on ourselves?
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.560]   So it is really crucial to nail down in the Christian mind and heart, every believer,
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.340]   how we got right or get right with God as sinners so that our sins are all forgiven,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.940]   our guilt is totally removed, God's wrath is taken away, there is no condemnation.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:54.340]   For him, our consciences are clean, we enjoy peace, peace, peace with God, and we're in
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.460]   Christ and God is 100% for us and not against us in anything that happens to us, whether
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.440]   it's the most horrible suffering or the greatest pleasure.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.100]   Now that really matters, to nail down how does that happen.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.980]   And the answer of the New Testament, the glorious gospel, is that we are justified before God
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.460]   in that way by faith alone apart from any works of the law of any kind.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:35.460]   In other words, when the Holy Spirit awakens our dead hearts to see Christ crucified, risen,
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.820]   Christ true and beautiful and valuable and sufficient to cancel all our sins and provide
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:50.880]   all our righteousness, when we see him like that by grace, our supreme treasure, our great
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.100]   love, we receive him like a child.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.780]   When we receive him like that, in that instant, we are made right with God on the basis of
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.740]   the blood and the righteousness of Jesus who died to bear our sins and provide our righteousness.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:17.460]   Jesus is the final decisive basis of our acceptance of God, his being 100% for us.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.100]   So what would it look like to be too hard on yourself in regard to justification?
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.980]   It would mean demanding from yourself that you be the one who earns your justification,
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.380]   that you be the one who deserves your justification, that you be the one who must suffer sufficiently
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.340]   in order to bear some of the punishment of your sins, that you be the one who deflects
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.420]   God's wrath away from you, that you be the one who is brilliant enough in the courtroom
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.900]   of heaven to get an acquittal, that you be the one who figures out a way to wipe your
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.220]   conscience clean before God.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.460]   All of that would mean you don't grasp the gospel, you don't receive God and what he's
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.620]   done for you.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:12.500]   You're being too hard on yourself by demanding that you do what only God can do and has done
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   for his people.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.340]   That would be a great sin to load yourself down with that hard burden.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.420]   Now, what about being too hard on yourself with regard to sanctification?
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:36.420]   That is, not how do I live to get right with God, but how am I supposed to live because
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.100]   I already am right with God through justification by faith alone?
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.460]   How am I to bring my life into conformity to what I really am in Christ?
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.260]   That's the sanctification question.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.500]   And Jesus spoke of the Christian life as a life of self-denial.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.180]   Is that hard on yourself?
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.060]   Bearing a cross, is that hard on yourself?
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.780]   Hating one's own life, Luke 14, 26, that's pretty hard on yourself.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.300]   Paul said that in order to enjoy life with God, we must put to death the deeds of the
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.420]   body, Romans 8, 13.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.460]   He said that he gives his body a black eye, keeping it under control, lest after preaching
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.820]   to others, he should be a castaway, 1 Corinthians 9, 27.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.540]   He said we commend ourselves by great endurance in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings,
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.980]   imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger, 2 Corinthians 6, 4-5.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.380]   Now based on those passages from Jesus and Paul, I conclude there's a sense in which
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.820]   we ought to be hard on ourselves.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:57.220]   And the question then rightly posed by Eliot and his wife and his colleagues is, "Is
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.700]   there a too hard?
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.780]   Is there a too hard on yourself?"
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:10.580]   The answer is yes, but I don't think a yes answer necessarily means that the person who
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.860]   is too hard on himself has set his standards too high.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.060]   It's not my diagnosis of what too hard means.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:27.540]   For example, a car salesman might set early standards for himself of selling a car a week.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.980]   Then he might up the standard to a car a day.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.620]   Then he might up the standard to two cars a day.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:43.060]   Now I would venture to say that neither his employer nor his wife would have any problem
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.180]   at all with these standards becoming increasingly unrealistic.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.940]   What they would have a problem with is whether his failure to meet the standard produces
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:06.220]   hurtful, sinful effects toward himself and others, and whether his success in meeting
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:13.940]   the standards produces hurtful and arrogant demeanor in him.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.540]   Very high standards are not the essence of the problem.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:27.460]   How a person responds to success and failure in meeting his standards is the problem, and
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.140]   the essence is much deeper.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:39.180]   So what would be the evidence that a person is being sinfully too hard on himself?
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.740]   And I'll just mention three things.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:47.020]   First, you're being too hard on yourself if your failures to meet your standards result
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.780]   in a depressed loss of joy in the Lord.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:08:01.340]   If you become brooding and gloomy and sullen and, in general, lack the hope-filled joy
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.740]   that Christ gives, you're not handling your failures in a faith-filled, Christ-exalting
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.740]   way.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:15.420]   You are being too hard on yourself in the sense that the hardness on yourself is producing
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.220]   sin, not holiness.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.420]   Second, it's evidence of a person's being too hard on himself if his failures result
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:30.220]   in hurtful anger, hurtful toward himself, inclining him towards habits that are self-destructive
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:37.180]   or hurtful toward others, because very often we take out on others our frustrations with
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.740]   our own sense of failure.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:46.540]   In either case, he's being too hard on himself in the sense that his hardness toward himself
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.340]   is producing unkind or damaging behavior to other people.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:59.860]   Third, it's evidence that he's being too hard on himself if his failures produce paralyzing
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.620]   fear or anxiety about approaching the tasks of his life.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:12.540]   If he feels like he's fallen short so often that he loses the capacity to attempt anything
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:18.700]   of significance, it's evidence that he's being too hard on himself in the sense that
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.020]   he's not trusting Christ for the ability to keep him going.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.700]   So what would I counsel then?
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.940]   I would say, look to Philippians 1, 12, and 13.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.940]   Paul deals with his own failures and imperfections like this.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:42.860]   Not that I am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.540]   has made me his own.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:51.700]   One thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.300]   I press on to the goal.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.580]   So I think what Paul means is this.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:03.500]   In my running the Christian race, the Christian life, I do not burden myself.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.580]   That would be the too hard.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:12.180]   I do not burden myself with the paralyzing effects of the memories of past failures,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:19.260]   nor do I burden myself with the killer weight of pride at my past successes.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:27.260]   Anything that would hinder my humble, loving, godly, holy race for the good of others and
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.500]   the glory of God, I forget it.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.380]   I lay it aside.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.340]   I don't let it produce sinful effects in my life.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.620]   So that's what I would call Eliot 2.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.060]   You don't need low standards.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.340]   That's not the problem.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:50.780]   You need humble, gracious, loving, kind responses to your successes and your failures in meeting
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.780]   those standards.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:58.220]   So remember, Christ has made you his own.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.660]   That changes everything about how you run your race.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.660]   Wonderful.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.460]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the great question, Eliot.

[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.520]   This next question up in the queue is one of the biggest that we can ever ask.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.100]   Why did God create us?
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.380]   Why did God create us?
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.100]   Not many questions get bigger than that one.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.820]   It's up next time when we return.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.180]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.580]   We will see you back here on Monday.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.740]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.740]   [end]
