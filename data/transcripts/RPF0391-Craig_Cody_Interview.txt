[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. One of the core aspects of
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.500]   good financial planning is to lower expenses. And for most of us, taxes comprise perhaps
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.120]   the largest percentage of our budget. Now, of course, there are many forms of taxes,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.080]   but they, when taken in aggregate, add up to a tremendous amount of money. So today
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.400]   I've invited Craig Cody, who's a tax planner on the show. Craig, welcome to Radical Personal
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Finance.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.640]   Thank you very much for having me.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.160]   So I'm excited to have you on and I want to talk with you. I love to talk with accountants
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.960]   and tax planners about specific ideas and strategies for how my listeners can reduce
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   their taxes. Now, obviously, this is a difficult subject to capture in something like an interview,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.120]   given that there are so many types of taxes and there's so many plans and so many strategies
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.920]   depending on a specific situation. But what I want to focus on is running through some
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.960]   ideas and some strategy of how my listeners can begin to approach the subject. But in
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.160]   order to engage their interest, you've contributed to a book called Secrets of a Tax-Free Life,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.320]   surprising write-off strategies most business owners miss, which is quite the title. And
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.200]   your chapter contribution is called this, How to Deduct Your Kids' Soccer Cleats.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.880]   Hint, give them a seat at the boardroom table. So here's what I want to know. How do I deduct
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.320]   my kids' soccer cleats?
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.400]   Okay. Let's just say you're a self-employed individual. We'll say you're a real estate
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.680]   agent. And you want to prospect for homes in your area that are actually maybe new listings
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.520]   or old listings. So you hire your kid to go out there every Saturday morning for about
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   three hours on his bicycle and come back to you for, with a list of addresses of homes
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.680]   that are for sale that you could do some further research on. Okay. And you decide, okay, I'm
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.800]   going to pay you $125 a day and it has to be reasonable compensation. All right. And
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.960]   then your business now deducts that money and pays your child. Okay. Let's just say
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.320]   your child is going to private school or your child is on a hockey team and it's expensive.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.040]   He's on a travel team. So you pay your child, you get a tax deduction for the payments to
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.200]   your child. Your child, who's probably going to make less than $4,000 a year is then going
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.080]   to have no taxable income at the end of the year. And he's going to use that money to
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.880]   pay for whether it's his private school, his cleats, his hockey lessons, his piano lessons.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.180]   So basically you're taking something that's a non-deductible expense and you're making
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.080]   it a deductible expense because you're paying somebody to perform a service for your business.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.200]   Are there any limitations on the types of things that I could hire my kids to do for
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.120]   me? Well, it has to be reasonable. Okay. So, you know, if your, your child's not a brain
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.440]   surgeon, you know, you can't pay him, you know, a million dollars a year to go around
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.640]   and check on properties. So it has to be reasonable compensation. And you could do that kind of
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.160]   research online to see what reasonable compensation is. And typically with a child, we like to
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.880]   make it to be, you know, less than $6,000 a year because of, you know, the reporting
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.080]   requirements, et cetera. But $6,000 a year to somebody that's in, let's just say the
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.840]   25% tax bracket's $1,500. If you have three kids, that's $4,500 a year in savings. Explain
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   more of what you mean as far as what's the difference. Why $4,000 a year? Why $6,000
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.480]   a year? Why are you looking out for these numbers? Because at a certain point, your
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.880]   child has to file a tax return. Okay. And you don't want the tax that he winds up paying
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.560]   to be equal to the tax that you have to pay. And basically we want to make it so your child
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.080]   has to pay no tax. So that's why we use that $4,000 to $6,000 number. Have you hired your
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.440]   kids? Do you have kids and have you hired them in your business? Yes. I've hired my
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.800]   kids. I, my kids have gone to a Catholic school and that's how they paid for their Catholic
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.120]   school. They worked for me. The money went into their bank account and the school deducted
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.360]   that money every month and paid the tuition and they did a job and we kept good records.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.400]   How old are your kids now? My youngest is 21. Did they ever feel frustrated with you
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.360]   or angry that you forced them to work to do this thing? Tell me about their relationship
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   dynamics. No, it was, you know, my kids live a good life. Okay. And they're good kids and
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.600]   they understood what was going on. And, um, you know, it's, it, it is still is a very
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.400]   good work ethic and I'm lucky I have a 21 year old that's a senior in college as an
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.080]   accountant. I have a 24 year old that's a law school student and I have a 25 year old
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.360]   that's a New York City police officer. So how, what type of records did you keep for
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.120]   your kids? Well, every, every Saturday when they work, they'd have to sign in in the morning.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.240]   Okay. And then they'd have to sign in at the end of the day. We kept those records and
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.880]   we kept them in a file. We pay them. We, you have to make sure you pay them and it went
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.520]   into their bank account. Okay. And then every month the school drafted the bank account
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.720]   and pay the tuition. Did you do any strategies such as, I know one that parents are often
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   think about is doing something like making up your own parental match of money and then
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   contributing it into a Roth IRA. Did you do any of that kind of thing with your kids?
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.120]   No, we didn't do that. But that's another thing that people will do is they'll, they'll
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.640]   pay the child so that child can put money into an IRA. So by the time they're 18, you
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.560]   know, they could have substantial money in there. You know, another thing we do is with,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.800]   we have a lot of real estate agents and, uh, realtors tend to have children and children
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.680]   tend to need braces. So for a real estate agent, we'll set up what's called a one Oh
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   five, a section one Oh five plan, which is basically a medical expense reimbursement
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   plan. So typically when we have our medical expenses on our personal tax return, we deduct
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.920]   them on schedule a, if they don't exceed 10% of our adjusted gross income, we really don't
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.640]   get a deduction for it. So instead our realtors will set up a section one Oh five plan, which
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.840]   is fairly simple to set up. Okay. Um, and then they will be able to deduct the cost
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.400]   of certain medical expenses, most of their medical expenses and get a dollar for dollar
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   deduction.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.280]   So I want to come back to that in a second, but let me just real quick explain the Roth
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   IRA thing for kids, for my listeners who may not be familiar with it. Um, in order to make
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.560]   contributions to any type of a retirement account, like a traditional IRA or a Roth
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   IRA, the contributor needs to have earned income. So in this case, a child needs to
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.480]   have earned income. So if you've arranged a situation where your child can work each
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:30.040]   Saturday and earn as, uh, as Craig said, $4,000 per year, perhaps that $4,000 per year counts
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.360]   as earned income. And they can contribute all of that up to either the yearly maximum
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.160]   or up to the maximum of their earned income into a retirement account. So what many parents
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.800]   can choose to do is they will help arrange employment for their child so that they have
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.540]   $4,000 of earned income. And then they'll also make a bonus gift to their child of something
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:57.440]   like $4,000 and then $4,000 will go into the Roth IRA, uh, which is the child's earned
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.720]   income. And then they'll go ahead and contribute or gift to the child $4,000, which they can
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.240]   then use for living expenses. So it's a way of the parents, uh, giving money to the child,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.920]   but giving it in such a way that it can be put into a Roth IRA, which can be, uh, which
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.540]   can grow tax free, uh, forever. And one of the major benefits of that is because the
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.200]   child is earning a very low amount of income and they're paying taxes on that $4,000 of
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.520]   income, they're paying taxes at either a zero or a 10% rate depending on, on the bracket.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.560]   And it's a very, very low, uh, effective tax rate. So it's a very useful way for essentially
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.720]   a parent to, to help a child fund a Roth IRA from an early year. And if you start that
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.920]   or you can help them get employment at a very early age, you get a tremendous growth of
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.080]   compounding over time. Is that, that about accurate, Craig? Did I miss anything important?
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.360]   Did not miss anything. What's the earliest age that you've seen a client be able to justify
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   hiring their children? Okay. Well, I believe the tax court says seven. Uh, we typically
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.360]   would not use anyone less than 11 years old and it really depends on what they're doing,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.840]   but I'm more comfortable with somebody 11 years old and older. Okay. Back to the section
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.440]   105 plan. So, uh, how would I, if I, you know, I have a business, radical personal finance,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.840]   uh, and I could hire my kids in that, how would I go about setting up such a thing?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.720]   If I know my kids are coming up with braces and I want to set up such a plan, how mechanically
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.520]   do I research that and do it? It's a, it's a relatively easy, um, setup. It's a simple,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.200]   you know, couple of page document. What you basically do is you, you, you hire, let's
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.240]   just say your spouse. Okay. And the section 105 plan says that, you know, for her reasonable
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   compensation, she is basically, um, able to pay her certain medical expenses. Okay. Up
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.000]   to whatever would be reasonable compensation for the job she's performing. And then those
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.880]   medical expenses are for her family. So that would cover her children and her spouse. So
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   she's not actually getting a W2. Her compensation is in the form of a section 105 plan. And
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.200]   it could, so could I make all of her compensation under that section 105 plan? Well, I mean,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.040]   it has to be reasonable compensation. So if it is reasonable compensation, yes, all of
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.800]   the compensation could be under that section 105 plan. And the benefit of that, a couple
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.840]   of other things, for example, um, if my, if my wife and I are both working in the same
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.400]   business, then if we go on something like business travel, if we're both employees of
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.560]   the same company, uh, we may be able to deduct the full cost of those expenses instead of
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   me simply deducting the cost of my expenses. Uh, and that would be much easier to do if
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   we were both employees of the company. Uh, it's much easier to deduct other personal
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.800]   expenses, whether that's cell phone costs and similar things. Am I accurate in those
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.960]   statements? Well, uh, you know, if it's a business expense, we can deduct it. If it's
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.000]   personal, we can't deduct it. So you want to make sure that it is actual business. So,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.840]   you know, um, you know, the wording is important. Correct. Uh, that's in my studying of this
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.680]   subject. If you want to answer any tax question, uh, I have a lot of beefs with the IRS. I
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.760]   have a lot of beefs with the tax code, but, uh, when I study it, generally I find that
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.160]   there's a pretty consistent theme throughout it that if this is a business expense and
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.360]   it's legitimate business expense is deductible and you can do, uh, you can deduct it. If
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.040]   it's not, it's not. And that's a doctrine that continues through in every area. Uh,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.360]   I'd love to hear some other stories. I mean, you've been doing tax planning for, uh, I
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.880]   think you said six, 16 years, 16 years. We've been focusing on it for probably on a business
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.520]   owner for about six or seven years. Um, there's the, there's, there's another thing we, we
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.320]   call it the Augusta rule. Okay. Augusta, Georgia, where they have the, uh, what is it? The US
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.520]   open the PGA tour, uh, every year. Um, and I guess there's not a lot of hotels for people
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:59.420]   to stay at. So the government basically wanted people to rent out their homes. Okay. So basically
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.200]   if you rent your home to your business for less than 14 days a year or 14 or less per
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.560]   year, your business gets a deduction and the homeowner does not have to pick up the income,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:17.760]   uh, on the tax return. So basically if you have a fence at your home for your staff,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.520]   okay, you could rent your home to your business. Your business pays you personally and your
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.480]   business gets a deduction and you don't pick up the income. So how, let me think how I
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.520]   do that. You're thinking of things like a company party or like a planning meeting or
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.280]   a board or corporate corporate meeting, something like that. Any type of a board meeting, staff
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.680]   meeting, you know, it has to be, you have to see what they would charge if you went
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.960]   to a restaurant and said, you know what, I'd like to rent your room, but I'm not going
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.800]   to buy food for you. How much are you going to charge me? Okay. So once again, you have
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.520]   to make sure that your numbers are correct. Right. And this would be another example where,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.320]   uh, in my study and I'll just tell the idea and then you correct me if you're wrong, but
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.920]   uh, you have different, um, meals and expenses. So generally meals and expense meals and entertainment
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.600]   are deductible at 50% of the cost, but there are a section of 100% deductible meals and
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.680]   entertainment expenses. And one example of that would be something like a company party,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.200]   a five year anniversary party or a sales party or something for the launch of a new product.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.240]   So there's no reason if the event is for a legitimate business purpose and you would
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.080]   want to have good documentation, good pictures of it showing that yes, this is a five year
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.720]   celebration of the company, not a Joshua's birthday party. You'd want to have that. This
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.680]   is a launch of a new product, et cetera, appropriate business purpose. But if there's an appropriate
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.360]   business purpose for an event, there's no reason why you can't hold a large business
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.640]   function in your home. Uh, there's no reason why you can't have your business pay you a
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:50.200]   rental expense for that. And there's no reason why you can't pay for all of those party expenses,
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.280]   the food, the catering, the entertainment, et cetera, out of the business checkbook and
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.800]   have that be a completely deductible expense. Is that accurate, Craig?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.200]   Well, it's pretty accurate. You just have to make sure because the travel and entertainment
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:12.360]   rules are very onerous. But in this case, it has to be for employees, staff and the
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.640]   board of directors. If it's for clients, it doesn't meet the rule. Okay. And it's not
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.440]   a hundred percent deductible.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.400]   So for any clients, even if it is for a business purpose?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   Correct.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.480]   Okay. So that's good. So I was wrong in my impression of that. Uh, what about, so I guess
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.720]   then a better opportunity would be something like you said, a company staff meeting or
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.640]   board meeting, or how about something like a company Christmas party? Would that be a
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.800]   workable, a workable solution?
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.840]   Correct. For the staff. Correct.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.600]   Interesting. Where do you go as a lay person to try to figure this stuff out and learn
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   about it?
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.120]   I guess you could go to the tax code. I go to seminars throughout the country a number
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:55.160]   of times of year. They're typically hosted by, you know, uh, CPAs that do, um, training
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.720]   for other CPAs, uh, where a lay person would go. I, you know, I would say, I guess they
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.400]   could search the internet and hope they get it right. Um, you know, it's, you know, it's
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.840]   kind of like, you know what, you could go to the store and buy a bone saw, but would
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.800]   you want to amputate your own leg?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.000]   Not so much. So tell me some other stories. What are some other, the interesting ones
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.600]   that you look at that, that, that people love to hear, uh, hear about when it comes to the
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   world of tax deductions?
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.200]   Well, they, they love the, you know, the medical expense reimbursement plan. They love the
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:40.440]   self rental. Okay. Um, let's see. Um, you know, real estate, um, if people that own
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.680]   real estate, there's something called cost segregation, which basically is, it's almost
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:50.680]   like an accelerated depreciation. So, um, I have a client that has five rental properties.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.480]   Okay. And he's depreciating these properties over 27 and a half years. And now he's going
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.400]   to sell one of them. Okay. And he's going to have a big gain. And we talked to him about
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.840]   doing a, what's called a cost segregation study. And it basically, you accelerate some
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.400]   of that depreciation. So instead of writing everything off over 27 and a half years, you
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.280]   get to write some things over five years, seven years, 10 years, and 15 years. So in
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.560]   the early years, you pick up more depreciation. In the later years, you pick up less depreciation.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:29.400]   Okay. Um, you do a cost segregation study, you fill out a certain form of 3115 for the
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.560]   IRS and you pick up all that missed depreciation over the last five or seven years in one year
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.240]   and you get to offset some of the costs of the gain.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.640]   So my understanding of this cost segregation strategy, the reason this works is because
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.680]   instead of having the entire value of the home counted as real estate, which would be
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.880]   depreciated over that 27 and a half year period, you're recognizing that there's a certain
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.460]   value of plant and equipment or appliances, things like that. And some of those are able
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.920]   to be used more quickly. And so thus, if you go ahead and figure out that of this million
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.760]   dollars of value in these properties, $50,000 of value is, is a plant and equipment that
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.080]   can be depreciated more quickly. That's why you get that depreciation. Is that accurate?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.440]   Okay. So this is definitely useful because I've spoken with a number of real estate investors
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.920]   here in my local area. And especially, I mean, Craig, my impression is this as much, if you
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.240]   have larger commercial property, this is probably very much something you should pursue if you
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.080]   haven't. I don't have the impression that it's so applicable if just somebody has one
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.440]   or two rentals. Am I wrong in that impression?
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   Yes, you are.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.360]   Okay. Tell me, tell me more. How does it apply in a individual residential property?
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.560]   Well, depending on how much you paid for that property, how much you allocate towards the
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.560]   land and how much you allocate towards the building, it can make a, it can make a difference
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.360]   of $20,000 a year in depreciation.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.360]   That's well worth investigating. So you do this thing, you do this tax planning thing
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.320]   for a living. And I'd love for you just to talk about, let's pretend I or one of my listeners
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.880]   walks into your office. Now, obviously you can't teach somebody everything that you do
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.000]   in the course of a short podcast interview, but where do you start? What do you actually,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.280]   when you're looking at a client situation, where do you start and what do you look for
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.080]   to try to figure out where they can save money in tax?
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   Well, first thing we look at, you know, okay, did they pay any tax? Okay. Because if they
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.280]   didn't pay any tax, there's probably nothing we can help them with.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.840]   So what do you mean by any tax?
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.440]   Any income tax or any self-employment tax. Okay. Then we look at the entity structure.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.000]   Okay. A lot of times people set up their business and they basically go to the attorney and
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.520]   they say, I want to start a business. And he says, okay, set up an LLC or set up a corporation,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.280]   whatever he's typically more familiar with. Okay. There's no planning that goes into that.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.200]   All right. So, um, we look at that and we, a lot of times just changing the structure
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.760]   of your entity can save you a lot of money.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.540]   So explain why, uh, the different entities and the different advantages and disadvantages
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.020]   for each type of taxation.
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:13.880]   So we'll, we'll compare an LLC and an S corporation. An LLC, all of your net income is taxed as
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.000]   income and it's also taxed for self-employment tax. Okay. So that means basically on the
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.680]   first $120,000 of profit, you're paying 15% self-employment tax plus regular income tax.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.800]   Whereas if you were set up as a corporation in this case as S corporation and you took
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.460]   a reasonable salary, you might be able to cut your self-employment tax in half.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.140]   Can you not do that? Can you not do that just simply by electing to be taxed as an S corporation
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.920]   while maintaining your LLC?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.000]   Yes. But, um, that's, I would say that's rare that I come across that.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.560]   Why? Why is it rare? I mean, yes, I imagine it's probably rare, but is it, is there any
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.600]   technical advantage from the taxation perspective to my choosing to maintain an S corporation
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.960]   instead of an LLC taxed as an S corporation?
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.360]   No, no. And like I said, we rarely see somebody come into us that is an LLC and they're taxed
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.240]   as an S as a corporation or an S corporation. Um, a lot of times that's one of the things
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.400]   that we'll recommend if they are an LLC, we'll recommend that, okay, you don't need to change
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.040]   your entity. Okay. Probably from a legal perspective, it's better to be an LLC. Okay. So now we
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.840]   could, you know, take advantage of the tax code and elect to be taxed as an S corporation.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.680]   Do most people with LLCs come in, are they being taxed as a C corporation or they're
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.920]   being taxed as a sole proprietorship?
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.960]   Most LLCs we see are either taxed as a sole proprietorship or they're taxed as a partnership.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.480]   Okay. I don't believe I've ever had somebody come into my office that was an LLC being
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.680]   taxed as a corporation or an S corporation.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.320]   Interesting. Sorry. I meant to say partnership is what I meant. Okay. So what else, what
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.720]   else do you look for?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.600]   Um, so, so we'll start there. We'll start to look at their compensation to see if their
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.480]   compensation is reasonable. Um, a lot of times we'll see a regular C corporation where
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.240]   the owner is taking all his compensation out in wages. Uh, that could be a trigger for
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.240]   the IRS and we'll figure out ways to deal with that.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.120]   Um, how do you define reasonable? I know this is a big question that people say, you need
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.720]   to have reasonable compensation. How do you figure out what is defined as reasonable?
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.440]   Well, you, you can hire a company to do a compensation study for you. Okay. And, uh,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.920]   for, you know, less than a thousand dollars, they'll do a compensation study and they'll
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.040]   tell you what reasonable compensation should be based on what you're doing. Okay. So you
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.760]   want to separate out, separate out what your job functions are, how much of it is management,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.080]   how much of it is employee type work. Um, you can go online and you can go to the IRS,
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:55.520]   you know, website, download schedule C information for that type of business. See how many schedule
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.640]   C's there are and what the average compensation is. There's a lot of different things you
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.960]   can do, but you know, depending on what the dollar amount is, you know, you may want to
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.520]   go and get a real compensation study. What else, what other ideas do you have and
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.560]   how else would you approach a planning situation? You know, here's another one, you know, home
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.160]   office, you know, we always hear, Oh, home office, it's a red flag. It's not an IRS red
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:26.280]   flag. You just have to make sure the, the space inside of your office, okay. Um, you
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.740]   accurately accurately documented, it's only used for business purposes. And then you get
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.440]   to write off a portion of your, you know, your real estate taxes, your mortgage interests,
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.320]   your maintenance, your utilities. And then some people will say to me, well, why should
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.880]   I write off my real estate taxes and my home interest on my home office? I get to get them
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.160]   on schedule a, okay. Well, part of the reason is depending on how much money you are making,
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.680]   if you're subject to alternative minimum tax in the Northeast, at least, you know, our
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.660]   real estate taxes are generally high, so they get added back. Okay. And you lose the deduction
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.200]   basically for that. Whereas if you're taking it as part of your home office deduction,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.920]   you're not going to lose that deduction. Um, another thing you're allowed to do is if you
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:15.000]   have a home offices, you're allowed to have a, um, a deductible home athletic facility
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.600]   for the employees that work in your home office. Okay. So if you have a home office and maybe
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.720]   you have a gym in your basement or pool, okay, you can make a lot of those expenses deductible
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.640]   if they're for your employees.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:36.880]   Yes. Interesting. So in, when I've looked into this in the past, when I looked into
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.320]   the athletic facilities and the, and the opportunities there, I found that one had a lot of hurdles
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.440]   and I came to the, to the understanding myself that that one really wasn't worth pursuing.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.240]   So I'm interested in your, uh, and I, it wasn't worth pursuing cause it had so many hurdles.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.120]   Uh, before we get to like a home office, is it possible to do something where you're doing
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.800]   things like gym memberships or athletic club memberships? Is that, is there any way to
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.320]   deduct those expenses? No, there are not. So the home office, excuse me, the home gym,
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.040]   are there rules on its accessibility and availability to other members of the family or is it, is
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.560]   it able to be available to them and it's just gotta be, uh, in the home for the employees?
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.520]   Correct. Correct. So if it's for the employees and their families.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.440]   Interesting. I could see that being effective for somebody who wants to set up something
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.560]   like a, I don't know, a pool or, or an exercise pool or, or something like that for physical
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.520]   therapy. Uh, as when you get into bigger expenses, it probably would be well worth looking into.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.320]   Yeah. I mean, listen, they all add up. Yeah. That's the challenge with tax plan. People
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   want one, one big thing and it's always, uh, it seems to be many, many little things. I'd
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.840]   love for you to talk a little bit about your perspective and how you advise people when
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:54.400]   it comes to vehicles, uh, and the various deductions for vehicles and then the various
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.080]   um, ways that somebody can own and operate vehicles. Share with us a little bit about
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.480]   your advice on, on, um, business, business vehicle deductions.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   Well, typically, I mean, if I was to generalize, I would say that you're going to get a bigger
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   deduction from a vehicle lease than you are going to be get when you purchase a vehicle.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.000]   Okay. And let's not talk about big trucks where they get to write off the whole truck
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.760]   in the year they purchase it. But let's just talk about your standard car. Okay. Um, that
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.920]   you use maybe 80% of the time for business. So if you have a lease and you write off 80%
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:35.400]   of your lease, okay. Um, let's just say you're driving a BMW for $500 a month. So you get
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.720]   to write off, you know, 40% of the, I mean, 80% which is $400 a month of that lease. Now
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:49.440]   the IRS uses an inclusion table. Okay. Basically an amount that you have to add back to income.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:55.160]   And that number is such a tiny number. It's almost ridiculous to even have it. All right.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:01.680]   Um, but most clients will get a bigger bang on a vehicle lease assuming they're not doing,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.920]   you know, 30,000 miles a year and stuff like that. Why? And this is because the reason
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.720]   I ask is this is a, you hear all kinds of pieces of advice on this. So why would, why
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:18.440]   would I get a bigger, um, bang for my buck, better deduction leasing a car versus buying?
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.960]   Because when you purchase a vehicle, just like any other asset, you have to depreciate
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:29.040]   it. Okay. And typically vehicles, unless they're over like 6,000 pounds, you can't take a section
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.280]   179 deduction, which means you write it off in the year that you purchase it. Okay. So
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.600]   you have to depreciate it over time. And I believe the first year's depreciation on a
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.240]   vehicle, if you're using it, a hundred percent is about $2,600. So if you're using it 80%,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.200]   that's, you know, let's just say it's $2,000. All right. Versus the lease that's costing
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.360]   you $500 a month and you're using it 80%, you're getting about a 4,000, $5,000 deduction
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.760]   for it. So you're doubling your deduction.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   So that that's assuming however, that I'm using an actual cost, uh, expense reporting
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.720]   methodology rather than a mileage expense reporting methodology. And that's assuming
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:15.520]   that, uh, the actual, that the actual cost is less than, than the mileage. Is that right?
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   Exactly. Exactly. Right. Cause when I've, I mean, I'll be, I've always driven cheap cars
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:26.280]   in my businesses and always been able to use cars to create, uh, I guess, I don't know
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.880]   what the right term for it is. I call it a phantom tax, a phantom tax loss, meaning that
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.640]   the vehicle probably costs me because the car is so cheap. Um, I can't remember when
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.360]   I've calculated, but let's just say it costs me 30 or 40 cents a mile to run. And the actual
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.880]   expense allowance that the IRS permits is what is it? 57 cents, something like that
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.480]   now. Uh, so I wind up for every mile I drive, I wind up picking up, let's just say a 30
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.280]   to 40 cent per mile, um, tax loss. Uh, and that's been, that's always been something
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.960]   that's beneficial to me, but it assumes however, that I'm driving an older, uh, inexpensive
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.800]   to operate vehicle. Yeah, most definitely. I mean, you really have to look at, you have
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.200]   to look at, you know, all the different, you know, instances and figure out what works
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.080]   best for you. But typically what we get is we get the client that's saying, listen, I'm,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.880]   I'm going to buy a new car. Should I buy it or should I lease it? Okay. They're not interested
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.360]   in driving the 1980 Chevy citation. You know, they're ready to buy a new car. They don't
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.160]   want to deal with the headaches of, you know, operating an older vehicle. So it really comes
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.240]   down to preference. And then once you know what your preference is, then we figure out
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.360]   what's the best way to go. You see a lot of people talk about the 6,000 pound heavy vehicle
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.840]   thing. Uh, and do you see the people buying big SUVs, et cetera. Can I buy a Range Rover
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.640]   and get extra tax benefits because I chose to buy a Range Rover instead of a BMW sedan?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:55.080]   Yes, you, you, you basically, you can, you know, assuming it meets the qualifications
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.920]   for section one 79, which a Range Rover would. Okay. But it's kind of like, are you buying
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.080]   it because you want the Range Rover or are you buying it for the tax deduction? Okay.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.640]   Um, if you're buying it for the tax deduction, you're kind of going down the wrong path.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.520]   You still have to spend the money. Generally, I find that when people want to spend lots
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.800]   of money, they say I'm doing it because I get a tax deduction when in reality they spend
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.200]   more money on it than they save on taxes. I usually find that tax deductions are a good
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.600]   excuse for people buying fancy stuff for them and paying more money. Exactly. Because let's
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.760]   just say you're in, you're in the, you know, 30% tax bracket, 25% bracket. You're only
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:37.120]   getting, you know, 25 cents, 30 cents on a dollar. Okay. So you still have to pay for
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.360]   that vehicle. Right, right. And you get the same problem that you're going to get the
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.040]   biggest tax deduction if you buy the newest vehicle. But the newest vehicle is where you
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.800]   have the highest appreciation and so you have the biggest expense. So sometimes you can
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.740]   come out better if you, uh, if you choose to buy something different, something older.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.120]   As you said, you've got to decide what you're trying to do and what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.580]   Right. I would, I would never, you know, advise somebody to go out and buy a vehicle or lease
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.720]   a vehicle so they could get a tax deduction. It's typically, listen, this is what I'm looking
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   to do. We need to buy a new vehicle for the business. Okay. Which way should we go? Okay.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.520]   And we do the analysis and that's what we come up with. It's never the other way around.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   Do you have any other ideas for the kinds of things that people can deduct? Uh, that,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:26.920]   you know, the, again, the sexy stuff, the toys and things like that. Oh, let's see.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:33.040]   You know, what about stuff like boats and airplanes? Uh, well, you know, we don't get
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.320]   too many people coming to us. There are rules with airplanes. Okay. Um, I believe that you
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.160]   get accelerated depreciation. I've honestly never had somebody come to me, you know, they
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.080]   were going to buy an airplane. Um, but there are special rules for airplanes, um, that
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.560]   we do a little bit of research for. I mean, you know, your 401k plan, your, you know,
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:00.160]   depending on where you are operating, there are, um, different types of defined benefit
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.280]   plans, how much free cashflow you have. You know, there's a lot of things that go into
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.320]   it, uh, other than just say, I want a deduction. Okay. Can you afford the deduction? You know,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   can you put all this money away for your retirement? You know, can I use this money to do something
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:21.800]   else? Um, but typically the sexy ones are your self rental, your medical expense reimbursement
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:31.120]   plan, you know, your typical 401k, um, the vehicles. All right. Um, making sure they're
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.320]   taking, if they're using a home office, they are taking advantage of all the home office
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:41.280]   deductions they can. Uh, those go into it and the right entity, the right entity classification.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.440]   You know, we, we had one client that we saved, uh, the wrong entity classification was costing
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:54.360]   them $450,000 a year. Okay. So, um, it was a pretty simple fix. Pretty simple. You, you
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.640]   earned your fee on that one. Craig, let me ask you a question. And, and my listeners
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.880]   know that this one's a, uh, an area of special interest for me. You live in Massachusetts,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.560]   is that right? No, New York, New York. You live in New York. Okay. Uh, have you ever
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:15.280]   thought about moving and do you just recommend that your clients move, um, to save on state
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:21.640]   income taxes? It's a discussion we have with the client, depending on, you know, what,
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.560]   you know, it depends on their business, where their business is located, or are they a consultant,
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.040]   you know, how, how are they working? Can they work any way they want? You know, I mean,
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.840]   luckily today they're, it's very easy to work remotely, but you know, if you're a brick
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.720]   and mortar, you can't really do that. Um, so it's a discussion we have depending on
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.200]   what type of business the person is in. Yes. But you could move from New York to Texas
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.920]   or Florida that has no state income tax and, you know, save a lot of money. Or even in
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.520]   New Hampshire if you want to stay in the Northeast. And, uh, I think New Hampshire taxes dividends,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.800]   uh, and investment income, but they don't tax earned income. Uh, is that, I think that's
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.440]   right. Um, have you ever considered moving yourself? No, no. Why not? I'm, I'm, I'm New
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:09.480]   York, uh, grown and raised and I'm not going anywhere. I love them 15 miles, 20 miles to
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:17.040]   Midtown Manhattan. You know, um, I love it here. You know, um, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.560]   They got you. They got their hooks into you. That's right. And they'll soak you for all
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.960]   the money. That's, that's, you know, it's the cost of doing business. Well, it is, it
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.640]   is always interesting to me because when I run the calculations and you go through and
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.460]   you figure out, okay, how much can I save on my tax return by setting up a home gym
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:38.100]   and a home office? And you know, these are for many people, these are hundreds or perhaps
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.040]   up to a couple thousand dollars of actual tax savings where on the mean time you have
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.640]   a state income tax bill of five, 10, 15, 20 grand, uh, even in a just comfortable middle
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.160]   income, uh, six figure salary people, uh, let alone, uh, the Uber wealthy, uh, and how
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.200]   big those bills wind up being. Craig, tell us about your business. Tell us about your
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.100]   tax practice and let us know any, uh, action step that you'd like my audience to take to
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.880]   follow up with you after this interview, if they'd like to work with you. Great. Well,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:14.200]   they could reach us, um, at www.craigcodyandcompany.com and if they go to that website, uh, forward
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:20.960]   slash, uh, R's in radical P's and personal F's in finance, they could, um, request a
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:29.700]   free copy of our book. All right. Um, our office number is 516-869-4051. We do a free
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:36.560]   analysis of your tax returns and our typical savings is close to $20,000 a year. You work
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.320]   with people all across the country or just New York? We, I have clients from Oregon to
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:48.720]   South Florida to obviously New York. Um, we have a team of eight, four CPAs here. Um,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.480]   we specialize in tax planning. That's where we start and we go from there to your typical
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:59.240]   tax and accounting work. Um, we have a little niche in, um, international clients that come
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.360]   to New York to do business. They're doing business in Europe or Coke. They want to do
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:08.240]   business in the US with Coke. And then we have, um, uh, the outsourced CFO business,
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   whereas you're, you're a little bit bigger company and maybe you have a CFO and he's
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.600]   doing low level to high level work and you know, maybe it's not working out. He's not
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.920]   satisfied because he doesn't want to do low level work and they'll hire us and we'll have
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:28.720]   a bookkeeper and a CPA assigned to you. And then I'll do the top down, you know, heavy
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.040]   lifting and we have a nice, um, diverse client group with that.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.880]   Great. I'll put those links in the blog post for today's show. Craig, thanks for coming
