[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:19.540]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.180]   We get questions all the time from people on Twitter,
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.020]   email, YouTube, where else?
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.120]   Some people shout at Duncan on the street.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.740]   Remember our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.020]   We're gonna try to answer all their questions today.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.980]   John, throw up our first one,
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.500]   which is just to follow up.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020]   Someone asked on Twitter, actually.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.780]   I told you to get us from anywhere.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.060]   Oh no, just the first Treasury Yield one, John.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.940]   There we go.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.020]   Someone asked us this.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.780]   Keeping with the theme that we've had in the last,
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.740]   ah, three or four months.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.940]   Lots of bond questions, lots of tax questions.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880]   We're gonna get to a lot of those today.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.020]   Someone on Twitter asked,
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.740]   what are some examples of bond ETFs
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.560]   that would lock in these rates
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680]   for three-month to two-year time frames?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.220]   Is there such a thing as an index one for these?
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.500]   So people are trying to figure out,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.600]   how do I invest in T-bills?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.580]   Kind of hard to believe,
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.700]   considering they've basically been zero for so long.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.940]   You can see six-month T-bills over 5%,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.780]   12-month T-bills around 5%.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.020]   Anything two years and under
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.660]   is looking pretty good right now.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.060]   The good thing is,
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300]   Duncan, what did you say your checking account is?
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.140]   Over 4%?
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.980]   You're not willing to go to T-bills yet?
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.780]   - 4.27% in my checking account.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.700]   - Okay, see, I think they do the weird numbers
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.740]   just to get people to look at it,
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.580]   'cause it's different.
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.820]   They don't round up or down.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480]   So the good news about T-bills is there's a ton of ETFs.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.720]   So it's easy to Google them,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.420]   but iShares has a one- to three-month T-bill.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.400]   State Street has a one- to three-month T-bill.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.320]   Fidelity has a T-bill index fund.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800]   Vanguard has an ultra-short bond ETF.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.880]   Charles Schwab has a U.S. Treasury short-term ETF.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.400]   There's also this new ETF provider
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.560]   called U.S. Benchmark Series
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.600]   that tries to give you exposure
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.880]   to single-security U.S. Treasuries,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.480]   so you can get three-month or 12-month or two-year,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.400]   and it basically just rolls it over every month
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.960]   into one specific security,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   so you're kind of constantly in that thing.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.760]   I think the big thing to remember
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.120]   if you're trying to invest in these
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.000]   is just to look at the average maturity
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.360]   and the average yield to maturity
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.640]   on whatever fund you end up buying,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.480]   and kind of compare that to what the T-bill yields are
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.600]   to make sure you understand what you're getting at,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.000]   'cause some of these, check the holdings by sector, too.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.320]   Some of these funds hold all Treasuries.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.120]   Some of them might have some corporate bonds.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.240]   So no right or wrong answer in terms of getting exposure,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.680]   but it's really easy, and also it just shows
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.640]   how much this market has changed
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.240]   over the past two or three years.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.600]   Before, everyone was, "How do you invest
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.240]   "in three-times-levered technology innovation stocks?"
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.800]   And now it's, "How do I get into T-bills?"
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.200]   - Right, from offering different cryptos
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.280]   and altcoins and stuff to now, "Oh, we offer T-bills."
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.080]   - Yes, they're the sexiest thing around right now.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.600]   And it's kind of mind-boggling that we had 15 years
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.160]   of more or less zero rates for a long time,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.320]   and now we immediately went from zero to 5%,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.640]   and people kind of are trying to figure out,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.560]   "What does this mean?"
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.960]   - Well, it also makes me understand
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.440]   the zero-coupon bonds even less now.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.640]   I was already kind of confused by those back in the day,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.160]   but now I'm very confused.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.720]   - Well, a T-bill is essentially a zero-coupon bond, Duncan.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.820]   So again, if you buy a T-bill,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.800]   you're not getting paid an interest rate,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.920]   'cause these things are three-months, six-months, 12-months.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.320]   You buy it at a discount.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.440]   So let's say the par value is $1,000.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.040]   You buy it for 900, and then when it matures,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   you get 1,000, depending on what the yield is.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.280]   That's a very simple example.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.120]   That's how it works.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.640]   So you're not being paid a periodic yield on a T-bill.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.240]   You're buying at a lower amount,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.400]   and then the difference is your yield.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.240]   - I see.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.080]   All right. - Right?
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.420]   - Learn something new every day.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.260]   - Here we go.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.640]   All right, let's get into some questions.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.400]   - Okay, up first today-- - Speaking of bonds.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.640]   - Yeah, up first today, we have,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.280]   "Can we get a breakdown of the pros and cons
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.000]   "of long-term versus short-term bonds?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.520]   "I like it, short and sweet."
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.400]   - I think this one actually came
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   from another good Twitter question.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   - Johnny on Twitter.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.560]   - All right, so again, I think I've received more questions
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.200]   about bonds in the last six months
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.760]   than I have in the last six years.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.480]   I think part of it is because
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.200]   so many people got wrecked in bonds last year.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.840]   If you had any sort of duration on in your bond portfolio,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.720]   you know, intermediate-term bonds fell 15%,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.480]   long-term bonds fell 30%.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.320]   We'll get into that a little bit.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.720]   Let's look at the little pros and cons for each.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.600]   So long-term bonds.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.620]   Remember, just simple math, Duncan.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.320]   Prices and rates are inversely related, right?
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.000]   So if rates go up, prices go down.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.100]   If rates, and if rates go down, prices go up, right?
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.040]   Inversely related.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.920]   The longer your duration of maturity,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.620]   the more variability you're going to have
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.720]   to those rate changes.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.440]   So if rates go up a lot,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.960]   your long-term bonds are gonna get crushed.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.800]   If rates go down a lot,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.480]   your long-term bonds are gonna do much better.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.820]   So the long-term bond pros include,
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.440]   you're gonna get more bang for your buck when rates fall.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.460]   So that's like recession and deflation protection.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.520]   You can lock in your yields for much longer.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.940]   These 5% short-term T-bill yields are great right now,
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.360]   but if we go into recession,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.960]   they could easily go away tomorrow, right?
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.680]   The Fed could drop rates back,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.440]   and those 5% yields are gone
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.280]   with longer-term bonds.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.540]   You can lock them in for longer.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.500]   You also should earn higher expected returns
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.840]   for taking more risk, right?
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.920]   You're lending your money for the government for longer.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.360]   That means more economic regimes,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.860]   more interest rate movements, more inflation movements.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.240]   All these things you should expect to earn higher returns,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.200]   even though you can't right now.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.600]   Cons for long-term bonds.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   They can get crushed when rates rise and inflation rises.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.920]   That's what happened last year, right?
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.520]   There's way more volatility in terms of inflation.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.840]   I think we've already seen long-term bonds
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.120]   be up like 10% this year,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.160]   and now they're flat on the year
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.000]   because rates are moving so much.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.880]   - They're the meme stock.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.840]   - Kind of.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.160]   Zero-coupon bonds are even worse
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.760]   because that's the longest-duration asset.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   And then you're locked into lower yields for longer
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.080]   if rates rise, right?
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.720]   Shorter-term bonds mature much quicker,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   so you can roll those over into new, higher yields.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.200]   Long-term bonds, you can't do that.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.400]   So short-term bonds are the opposite.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.640]   There's little to no interest rate risk.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.960]   I mean, if you go one to two years out,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.780]   there's a little bit,
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.600]   but trucking three or six-month T-bills,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.200]   there's basically nothing.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   That's great during periods of rising rates,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.400]   again, 'cause you can,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.880]   once they mature, you roll them over
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.920]   and reinvest at higher rates.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.280]   There's much less volatility.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.760]   It's pretty steady-idy,
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.960]   and then there's less reinvestment risk
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.680]   because, again, those bonds mature faster.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   The cons, you can't lock in those higher rates
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   for short-term bonds, right?
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.360]   Yields can change in a hurry.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.240]   That's a good thing when they rise,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   a bad thing when they fall.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.960]   You should have lower expected returns
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.000]   'cause you're not taking as much risk.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.040]   If you lend your money out to someone for three months,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.640]   that should be a lower return
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.320]   than lending someone out for 30 years, right?
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.640]   Obviously, the yield curve doesn't reflect that right now,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.360]   but that's a normal state of affairs.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   And then if we have a recession or deflation protection,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.240]   short-term bonds aren't gonna help as much
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.680]   because if rates fall to the floor,
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.840]   you don't get that price bump
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.960]   that other bonds get that are longer-term.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.480]   So it kinda comes down to risk-reward and your appetite.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.680]   Now, a lot of people fell in love
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.840]   with the idea of long-term bonds
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.880]   over the past 20 to 30 years
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.480]   'cause they generally provided much higher returns,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.320]   and they cushioned the blow
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.000]   during most market sell-offs until last year, of course.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.160]   So John, throw up the chart.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.640]   This is just 2022,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.200]   and I looked at a bunch of different durations.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.600]   So long-term bonds got crushed.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.960]   They were down 30%, more than 30%.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   That was worse than the stock market.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.200]   Intermediate-term bonds, this is talking seven to 10 years.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.000]   That was down 15%.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.280]   Short-term, one to three years were down a little bit,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.120]   less than 4%.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.760]   That's like a bad day in the stock market.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   And then T-bills, one to three months, were up 1.4%.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.400]   You can see they barely move at all.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.720]   You're just kind of getting that yield.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.200]   So this is what happened last year
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.400]   in a very high-rate environment
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.480]   where rates went up really fast.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.440]   Inflation goes up, that's what happens.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.080]   But that's one year, right?
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.040]   Anything can happen in one year.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.880]   Let's look at the historical performance
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.960]   on a much longer timeframe.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.920]   So this is, my basic thought is,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.200]   over the last 100 years or so,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.040]   we've had three interest rate regimes.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.480]   So I've got the data, this is 10-year Treasuries.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.760]   From the 1920s to the early 1950s,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.240]   it was basically range-bound from two to 4%.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.160]   Rates didn't go much higher or lower than that.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.200]   Then from 1950 to 1980, rates went sky high.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.120]   We're talking 2% to 15%, basically, in a 30-year period.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.440]   Ever since then, we've had falling rates.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.800]   And that's basically the three long-term,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.200]   like, secular phases, right?
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.000]   And, okay, what happened in those terms,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.840]   in terms of performance?
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.120]   John, let's do the next one.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.760]   So I looked at the returns for long bonds,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.360]   five-year Treasuries, and one-month T-bills.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.600]   Basically, the longest you can get,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.680]   the shortest you can get, and then intermediate term.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.880]   So in that range-bound market, long bonds did okay.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.160]   We're talking 4% per year.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.400]   They beat five-year Treasuries and one-month T-bills,
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.240]   which gave you 1%.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.760]   One-month T-bills is basically a good proxy for cash.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.440]   In a rising-rate environment, 1950 to 1980,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.240]   when rates went to double digits,
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.400]   now we're talking cash actually was the best performer.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.280]   It beat intermediate-term bonds and long-term bonds,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.040]   and it beat long-term bonds by quite a bit.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.440]   Then you had the falling-rate environment
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.240]   from 1980 to 2020.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.000]   Then you had those higher starting yields that happened
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.920]   because they moved so high.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.840]   Long bonds did amazing.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.080]   We're talking 7% to 10%, basically,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.360]   for five-year Treasuries to long-term bonds for 40 years.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.840]   That might be one of the greatest bull markets
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.800]   we'll ever see, certainly in fixed income.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.400]   You'd be hard-pressed to see an environment
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.440]   that would match that.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.480]   And then the COVID times, you see long bonds, again,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.880]   get crushed, five-year Treasuries have fallen.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.800]   Cash has held up well.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.120]   Over the long-term, long bonds have the best
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.360]   long-term returns, but they don't beat
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.400]   five-year Treasuries by much.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.880]   So you experience a lot more volatility.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.240]   You don't get a huge bang for your buck.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.400]   Obviously, you did better than cash.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.320]   So that's kind of where we are.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.480]   So the big question now is, okay, what is the next phase?
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.800]   Obviously, we're in an aggressive rate rise right now.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   I honestly don't know what's gonna happen next.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.880]   We could see rates go back to 2%.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.280]   That wouldn't surprise me in a recession.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.440]   We could see rates go a little higher
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.360]   if the economy remains strong and inflation remains strong.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.960]   We could see range-bound rates for a while.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.560]   That's kind of a cop-out answer, obviously.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.280]   But the truth is, no one really can guess these things.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.200]   So, John, put up my next chart.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.000]   Torsten Slak at Apollo produced this chart.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.800]   This is just looking at, going back to the early 2000s,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.080]   the survey of professional forecasters.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.600]   And the little dots on that graph
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.800]   show what they predict interest rates will do.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.240]   The bold green line shows what they actually do.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.680]   Obviously, they're always off.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.720]   It's impossible to predict rates.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.560]   Duncan, this feels a little more
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.840]   like the survey of amateur forecasters.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.680]   Am I right?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.440]   Anyway, so I think-- - Shots fired.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.760]   - Well, listen, I can't do it either.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.800]   That's the point.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   So I think my main takeaway is you don't choose your bonds
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.480]   based on your predictions of the path of interest rates,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.760]   'cause that's hard to do.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.040]   And even if you nail that macro forecast,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.840]   I don't know, the markets might not react
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.080]   as much as you want them to.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.560]   So I think it really comes down to understanding
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.600]   the risk and reward trade-off for the bonds.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.280]   Now, if you're trying to make your decisions
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.040]   based on the macro economy, you might say,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.120]   "I think a recession's coming,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.360]   "so I'm gonna put on as much duration as I can
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.040]   "and get that bang for my buck."
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.080]   Personally, I like to take risk where I'm being paid for it.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.320]   If we're talking about volatility and ups and downs,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.960]   and for me, that's the stock market.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.360]   So I think it's not worth it
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.400]   if you're gonna have this more stable anchor part
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.220]   of your portfolio be bonds.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.280]   I don't see the need to try to take that risk,
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.160]   especially when you're being paid 5% right now,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.320]   and you basically completely take volatility off the table
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   in short-term T-bills.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.600]   So that's kind of the way I like to look at it.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.320]   Even in normal times, if such a thing exists,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.080]   I'm not a big fan of taking out a lot of duration,
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.520]   'cause again, I think the fixed income part of your portfolio
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.560]   is meant for more stability.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.880]   Now, if long-term rates got up to 5%, 6%, 7%,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.720]   now we can talk, but I just think you have to figure out
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.860]   how much volatility you can handle
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.780]   and the kind of risks you're trying to protect yourself from
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.660]   before picking which bonds to choose from.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.700]   But understand that volatility profile,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.780]   especially when you take duration,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.260]   it sort of works in both directions.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.180]   - Now, I'm not trying to derail the whole show
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.140]   because I know we could talk all day about this topic,
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.740]   but where do I-bonds fall in all of this now?
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.140]   I haven't heard anyone ask about those in a while.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.740]   - True, I-bonds are pretty good, too.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.340]   You're taking the interest rate risk off the table,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.740]   and the rate is basically set every six months
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.700]   based on the inflation rate.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.340]   So actually, I guess inflation remaining a little stronger
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.720]   is probably good for people with the I-bond thing
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.760]   when that rolls over.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.380]   So yeah, no, I-bonds are a pretty good deal still.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.060]   - Have you noticed that those questions
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.260]   have dropped significantly?
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.860]   We were getting a ton of them.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.160]   - Yes, and I think, honestly,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.900]   that's because the rates dropped from 9% to 6%,
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.300]   and now you're getting five in a T-bill.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.060]   And remember how much of a pain in the butt they are
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.220]   for people to open accounts and you can only do $10,000?
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.940]   - Shout out, Treasury Direct.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.620]   - So that made sense when T-bill rates were at two
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.980]   and I-bonds were at nine.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.540]   Now we're talking six versus five,
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.120]   and maybe it doesn't make as much sense.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.380]   - Yeah, I think that's true.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.660]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.940]   - All right, up next, we have a question from Sam.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.780]   There for a while, we were basically an I-bond show,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.340]   honestly, you know?
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.500]   - That's true.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.140]   - All right, so Sam writes,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.500]   "My wife and I are interested in purchasing farmland
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.200]   "to help diversify our portfolio.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.000]   "A 40-acre piece owned by an uncle
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.760]   "is being offered to us below market value
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.180]   "to keep it in the family.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.460]   "We would buy and hold the land,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.920]   "rent it out to a local farmer,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.360]   "and have little to do with the farming operation.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.680]   "Aside from diversification and rental income,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.740]   "does farmland ownership have any tax advantages?"
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.060]   To me, part of the benefit would be
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.540]   until I get to be involved in the farming,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.520]   you know what I mean?
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.620]   - I've mentioned before on this show,
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.780]   I have an uncle who owns a farm,
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.340]   and when I was young, he would bring my brother and I
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.180]   and some of our cousins out,
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.780]   and we worked the farm for a week.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.900]   And I think at the end of it,
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   they would take us go-karting or something and pizza.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.660]   - Did you wear overalls?
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.860]   - I wish I had some overalls.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.420]   It's hard, I will say that.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.220]   If my uncle put his farm up for sale,
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.020]   I would not be the first one to hop on it.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.500]   It's hard work.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.020]   So I'm reading Brad DeLonge's book,
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.100]   "Slouching Towards Utopia,"
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.020]   and his stat that caught my eye,
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.860]   I was reading this last night,
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.100]   in 1870, 80% of the labor force worked on farms.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.300]   People basically made their own food.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.620]   It was hard work.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.240]   Yeah, that's tough.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.900]   So I think in terms of the tax advantages,
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.900]   we'll have to bring the expert here.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.800]   So let's bring on Bill Sweet.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.860]   - Hey, Bill.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.260]   - Hey, guys, broadcasting to you
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.180]   from my family farm in Warwick, New York.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.220]   How's it going today?
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.060]   - Yeah, I was about to say, you're basically a farmer.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.820]   - Basically, I have to drive through cow fields.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.300]   But Ben, I'm curious, at the Carlson Family Farm,
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.860]   what crop was being grown there?
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.700]   What were we doing on the weekend?
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.340]   - Huge, huge cornfields,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.360]   and now they've turned it into more of a fruit farm,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.300]   but everything.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.940]   They had the cows, the pigs, chickens.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.780]   - Awesome.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.620]   - It was a fully functioning farm.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.700]   Yeah, it was pretty impressive.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.540]   - Wow.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.580]   - So I guess this is the Bill Gates model, right?
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.100]   He's the largest individual owner
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.540]   of farmland in the country.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   - I didn't know that.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.500]   That's fantastic.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.040]   - Bill Gates owns 270,000 acres of farmland.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.100]   That's less than 1% of the farmland in the United States.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.140]   - Wow, he should be the third Bill on our show.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.620]   Well, how do we make that happen?
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.460]   - Let's get him on.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.460]   That's a bar bill, though, right?
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.260]   To have a bunch of Microsoft stock and then farmland?
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.020]   - Yeah, that's not a bad deal, and then charity, too.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.500]   - I'm guessing that farmland doesn't have any huge benefits
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.700]   beyond owning other sort of rental properties.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.660]   Is it basically the same thing
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.020]   as owning a house that you rent out?
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.140]   - Oh, Mr. Carlson, you would guess wrong.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.140]   No, Schedule F is, yeah, a really fascinating--
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.940]   - Oh, that's right, 'cause you might get some perks
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.780]   from the government for this.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.600]   I didn't think about that.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.440]   - You can do some really funky stuff,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.860]   but let's get to Sam's question.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.420]   Sam, by the way, really strong name,
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.760]   name of my firstborn son.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.220]   Just couldn't have picked a better name for the family,
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.920]   so good job, Sam's dad.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.980]   This is an interesting question.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.860]   So the tax expenses of farmland really depend a lot
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.560]   on whether you are materially participating or not,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.780]   and per Sam's answer,
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.000]   "I have little to do with a farming operation,"
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.480]   my guess is Sam's not gonna be materially participating,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.020]   and that, Ben, kind of reverts back to treating it
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.300]   like any other rental property.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.340]   You're gonna rent the land out.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.220]   You're gonna receive cash every month
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.020]   that hopefully the farmer will make a sales and pay you,
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.540]   in which case, you're gonna file a Schedule E,
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.260]   more than likely, or maybe form a 1065 and LLC,
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.900]   but ultimately, you're not really gonna differ at all
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.980]   from owning farmland versus renting an apartment,
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.940]   let's say, outside of that the property's not developed,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.480]   and the primary benefit you get
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.300]   when you are not materially participating
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.460]   is the tax code really has two kinds of flavors of income.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.780]   There's a lot of sub-flavors,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.220]   like different kinds of ice cream and different toppings,
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.620]   but the two general flavors are active income,
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.820]   which, you know, wage income, partnership income,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.500]   self-employment income, that's taxed at Social Security
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.080]   at self-employment rates versus passive income.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.180]   Passive income, like portfolio income,
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.860]   net rental income, like it looks like
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.500]   Sam's gonna participate, that's not,
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.140]   and that saves Sam about 12.4% of Social Security tax
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.620]   and about 2.85% of Medicare tax
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.060]   that he's not going to pay that he would
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.020]   if he were materially participating in the farm,
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.860]   so that's the primary tax advantage
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.360]   that you would get from farmland
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.020]   over another type of income.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.220]   - Can he count on subsidies too?
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.820]   Is he gonna get some subsidies from the government?
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.500]   - Yeah, so that's where we flipped the switch, Ben.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.920]   I'm glad that you brought that up, it was a perfect segue.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.380]   So the other option,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.400]   so assuming that Sam is not materially participating,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.880]   is this program, this method called crop sharing,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.800]   in which case, at some farmland, some ventures,
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.360]   and I'm picturing the serfs and Marxists involved,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   and there's British landlords,
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.460]   but you can pay your landlord in crops, right?
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.920]   I'm growing some good crop, I'm growing lentil,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.640]   I'm growing sorghum, I'm growing wheat,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.360]   and basically you can pay your rent in crops,
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.800]   and that has this neat advantage
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.960]   in that you do not have to realize a gain
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.560]   on your net rental income
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.020]   until such a time that you convert those crops to cash,
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.180]   meaning usually you sell them into the open market.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.880]   So that's an interesting tax deferral
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.040]   that Sam could go down if, with his farmer tenant,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.640]   that he's getting paid in crops.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.880]   I don't know how this works, Ben.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.200]   Were you paying your rent on the farm in bushels of corn?
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.480]   How does this work exactly?
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.680]   I'm not a farmer, so I don't know.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.700]   - Duncan only receives dividends in oat milk, actually.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.160]   - Oats? - Right, yeah.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.000]   Actually, I take delivery of oats,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.040]   and then press it down myself.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.120]   - In Brooklyn, New York, somehow.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.440]   Not a lot of storage space, yeah.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.320]   - Farmland is, I mean, that is the kind of thing
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   that, I mean, I guess until the robots come
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.400]   and they start making fake food for us or something,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.120]   that's the kind of thing you would assume.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.800]   Obviously, there's risks there in terms of weather,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.440]   and are you running it correctly,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.280]   or is the person you're hiring out to running it correctly
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.200]   in commodities, prices, all this stuff is a problem,
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.240]   but it's one of the, I mean,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.760]   people are always gonna need food.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.080]   - So it makes sense to me in terms of
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.780]   this more kind of steady-eddy real estate.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.400]   So the idea, to me, makes sense for people
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.280]   who maybe wanna own some real estate,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.200]   but not take as much risk.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.680]   - Yeah, and then if Sam does materially participate,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.000]   and that means usually you're basically loaning out
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.220]   more than half of the equipment,
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.040]   the wheelbarrows, the hose, whatever it is,
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.160]   or if you're actually doing some part of the farming,
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.440]   then you're filing a Schedule F,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.180]   and then there are a lot of neat tax benefits.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.200]   Three-year averaging, there's a lot of sharecrop subsidies,
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.760]   like you said, Ben, mentioned before,
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.000]   but that is completely out of my wheelhouse, for example,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.480]   so I'm going to very comfortably change the conversation,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.200]   Sam, you should Roth Area convert
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.440]   in the year that you purchase farmland.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.640]   - All right, that's a good segue
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.080]   into our next question here.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.000]   - Exactly. - Doug, let's do it.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.680]   - Okay, quick follow-up.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.360]   If you could farm anything, what would you be farming?
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.160]   - Probably hops, you know, for beer.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.760]   That would be my-- - Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.600]   - My cropping choice. - I think for me,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.560]   Bartlett Pears, I love those.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.440]   - Yeah, I get them every year, Harry and David,
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.280]   they're great.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.600]   - Okay, let's see, up next, we have a question from Randy.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.440]   - Randy. - I don't think
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.840]   we've ever had a question from a Randy.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.160]   - Great name, Randy. - Thanks, Randy.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.780]   I am 55 years old and leaning towards retirement.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.200]   Our financial situation is solid,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.960]   but retirement accounts are 95% of our money.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.680]   My wife is four years younger and will work
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.200]   for five more years with health benefits.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.360]   I plan to hold off any retirement distributions
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.280]   until 59 1/2, but qualify for the rule of 55
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.520]   as a safety net.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.880]   We self-manage without a financial advisor.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.040]   That being the case, can you identify
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.800]   any potential pitfalls that we might not have thought of?
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.760]   Also, if we have existing investments in traditional IRAs,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.600]   we are not good candidates for a backdoor Roth,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.520]   given the undesirable tax implications, right?
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.840]   - All right, Bill, I wanted to tell you this one.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.680]   I talked to a group of high school students yesterday,
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.460]   based in Brooklyn, on the Zoom,
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.200]   and because they had actually been reading
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.240]   my "Everything You Need to Know
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.560]   "About Saving for Retirement" book
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.640]   in their personal finance class.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.520]   We're talking 16, 17-year-olds.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.800]   - Wow, that's cool. - And did a long Q&A,
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.560]   and these kids are way more knowledgeable
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.680]   than I was at that age, and one of them asked me,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.000]   "When I start my IRA," and I liked how they said it,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.840]   "When I start it, should I use a Roth
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.640]   "or a traditional IRA?"
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.240]   And they said, "I'm leaning towards a Roth,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.600]   "but I wanna know," and so I appreciated that one,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.540]   right in your wheelhouse.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.400]   - That's great, I love it, it's a great setup.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   Yeah, so Randy, let's start with the backdoor Roth question,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.800]   right, 'cause that's where Randy ended.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.280]   Ultimately, let's talk about it.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.840]   Roth IRAs are subject to income limits.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.880]   If you were earning more than about $153,000 a year,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.680]   Randy mentioned that he's a joint filer,
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.320]   so that would apply to a joint couple.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.100]   You cannot directly contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.840]   Been your student 16, 17, my guess is they're not,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.400]   they're not pushing six figures yet,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.640]   if they are, God bless them,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.440]   and so they can directly contribute.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.200]   More than likely, Randy cannot.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.160]   But there's this neat quirk in the tax code
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.840]   in that you can contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.400]   a tax-deferred or tax-deductible IRA,
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.280]   at any income limit, and furthermore,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.480]   if you get above a certain modified adjusted
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.680]   growth threshold, about $218,000 a year,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.600]   you're not allowed to take a tax deduction.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.960]   So, and the last key to this chain of events here
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.280]   is that there's no income limit to convert
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   from a traditional IRA into a Roth.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.920]   There's no income limit that applies there.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.240]   So the process here is you're above the income threshold
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.480]   to contribute directly, you backdoor contribute
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.280]   to a traditional IRA, you wait a day,
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.080]   the next day you convert that to Roth,
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.160]   bing, bada boom, you've got yourself a super Roth IRA.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.440]   - Randy didn't really tell us how much of his,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.560]   he said, you know, 95% of the money
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.800]   is tied up in retirement accounts.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.640]   He didn't say what the mix is between traditional and Roth,
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.760]   but I get the sense from the question,
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.720]   he's kind of leading us to assume,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.240]   does it make sense for him to take
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.400]   some of that traditional money he has
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.360]   in like a 401k or an IRA, and convert it to Roth now,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.040]   and pay the taxes, or do you think he's so close
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.280]   that it just doesn't make sense anymore,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.480]   and just wait 'til he gets to that point of 59 1/2
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.400]   and he can start taking those withdrawals?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.320]   - Yeah, and that's a great question.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.440]   So, but Randy kind of hints at the catch.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.720]   There's a catch to this backdoor Roth problem,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.080]   which is the IRS treats all of your IRAs
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.520]   as if they're one giant IRA
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.040]   for the purposes of Roth conversion.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.200]   What that means is, if you contribute $6,500 this year,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.960]   and you don't take a tax deduction,
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.040]   in theory, if you didn't have any other IRAs,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.800]   you could immediately convert that and pay no tax.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.120]   But the problem is, if Randy has 200,000, 500,000,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.880]   if he has a large sum of money in an IRA already,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.240]   he's only able to convert pro rata,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.720]   and only the small amount that he contributed
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.920]   out of the total pie would be tax-free.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.200]   So more than likely,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.400]   if Randy tries to execute this backdoor Roth,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.080]   he's going to pay tax on most of the $6,500,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.160]   or whatever amount that he chooses to convert.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.800]   So I would separate that question
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.240]   from whether he should Roth convert or not.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   His other questions were, is there anything else
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.760]   that I'm thinking about retiring at 55?
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.440]   And Ben, where I wanted to go with this,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.520]   just to completely segue,
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   retirement, in my opinion,
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.680]   is trading money for time, right, ultimately.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.600]   And the ability to retire near 55
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   and enjoy potentially 40 years, right,
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.360]   maybe more than your working lifetime
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.640]   of being retired and being able to do
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.920]   what you want to do with your time,
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.080]   that to me is a beautiful thing.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.240]   And so the things that I think that I would think about
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.800]   are things like health insurance.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.240]   And it sounds like his spouse
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.440]   is going to work for a couple of years.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.280]   That's awesome.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.160]   If you have benefits through the spouse,
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.880]   that's probably going to cost you 2,000, $3,000 a month
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.720]   on the open market.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.880]   Great, let's ask our employer to pay for that.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.560]   Other things I might think about,
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.000]   Ben, Randy mentioned the rule of 55.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.280]   If you retire after age 55,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.680]   you can waive the 10% penalty
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.040]   if you take a distribution from your 401(k)
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.240]   or other tax deferred retirement plan
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.720]   early and not pay the 10% penalty.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.480]   And that was the other question that Randy had.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.080]   I think the ultimate thing to think about there
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.680]   is you do not want to roll those funds out to an IRA,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.320]   'cause IRAs do not participate in the rule of 55.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.920]   But I think Randy's thought about everything
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.280]   that I would think about, Ben,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.200]   thinking about retirement.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.880]   He's got a lot of bases covered.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.720]   - I think the biggest thing
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.200]   is what are you going to do with your time, too?
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.040]   If you're retiring early,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.080]   like, are you going to get bored?
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.840]   Do you have, you can only sit on the beach for so long.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.760]   Maybe some people can't,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.480]   but I think you need to have it figured out
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.320]   if you're going to do, what are you going to do?
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.920]   - You've got to get really good at golf.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.480]   - Well, yeah, do you have hobbies?
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.840]   Do you have, are you going to volunteer?
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.680]   What are you going to do with your time?
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.120]   I think that's probably the biggest transition
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.320]   for most people that they don't even plan.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.360]   You have all your finances planned,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.800]   but then it's like, what do I do?
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.840]   How do I stay social?
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.600]   How do I keep my brain functioning at a high level?
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.680]   How do I do all these things
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.840]   so I don't become depressed in retirement
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.680]   when I start doing what I'm doing?
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.500]   - Guys, we know the answer.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.400]   It's hot farming.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.560]   You call Sam a call.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.400]   Yeah, get yourself on a farm.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.840]   - Duncan, I thought about this.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.120]   I thought about this.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.220]   I would definitely farm coconuts and strawberries
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.040]   so I could have my own Miami Vice production.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.880]   - Wow.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   - You know, I've literally just said in the chat,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.460]   I said that Batnick would grow Miami Vices
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.600]   and Tropical Brothers shirts.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.040]   - If you plant a Miami Vice tree,
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.480]   does it, how long does it take to grow, guys?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   So is it--
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.200]   - All right, next question.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.800]   - Okay, up next, we have a question
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.320]   from a name I recognize, Hadley.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.380]   This is the second question that we've answered on the show,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.220]   so good job, Hadley.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.760]   - Is that our first, second time questioner?
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.840]   - I don't think so, actually.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.680]   - Okay.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.280]   - But yeah, so thanks for the question.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.120]   - Made the clip.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.680]   - I have a question about the best way to diversify
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.840]   out of large, single-stock positions.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.000]   Much of my net worth is in long-term positions
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.800]   of Apple and Amazon in a brokerage account.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.200]   I no longer feel comfortable with this asset allocation
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.600]   and would like to move into more diversified ETFs
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.120]   or target date funds.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.780]   I'm maxing out my 401(k) this year to lower my income
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.420]   so as much of the gains as possible
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.720]   can fall under a 0% capital gains tax rate.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.560]   What's the best way for me
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.000]   to diversify my concentrated positions?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.040]   - We get a lot of this at Rituals Wealth, don't we, Bill,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.400]   from people coming in, someone comes to us from Amazon
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.840]   or Google or Exxon, they've received a bunch
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.480]   of stock options, maybe that makes up 70, 80, 90%
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.320]   of their wealth in some ways.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.160]   They know that they kind of won the lottery
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.040]   if they were in a company that did well
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.440]   and the stock that did well,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.480]   but now they have these big tax bills
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.240]   and they wanna figure out, I know I need to diversify,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.560]   but I'm also staring down this huge tax bill.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.300]   How do I balance that mix?
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.120]   And so your point has always been, listen,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.040]   if you have a big tax bill, that means you won,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.680]   that's a good thing, but then how do you transition
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.320]   from that, and obviously we have some ways that we do,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.140]   but what are your initial thoughts here?
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.040]   - Yeah, so what Hadley is kind of hinting at
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.840]   and trying to thread the needle on is the mythical,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.000]   the magical 0% capital gains bracket,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.340]   and for an individual in 2023, an individual filer,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.600]   I'm baking in a standard deduction for this.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.960]   You can earn about $58,500 this year,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.720]   and after a standard deduction,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.680]   if that happens to all be capital gains
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.880]   in qualified dividends, your tax, your fed tax rate is zero.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.320]   So hypothetically, if you're earning $50,000 a year,
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.440]   and Hadley mentioned, hey, I'm gonna max out my 401(k),
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.120]   I'm gonna take $22,500, you could potentially realize
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.080]   another 20,000, another $22,000 of capital gains
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.400]   on top of your ordinary income,
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.960]   assuming that you're max funding a 401(k)
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.120]   because the taxable income bracket is what matters.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.800]   For a marriage filing joint couple, that's about $117,000.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.960]   I'm gonna really annoy Duncan here,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.440]   I made a little chart for you guys.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.000]   So for a married couple-- - I did a poll,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.960]   I did a poll today, and a lot of people
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.880]   thought you were gonna bring it.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.960]   - Oh, great, well, here it is, the napkin.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.760]   So for viewers, let's say a married couple,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.120]   $117,000 is that threshold, so that's my dotted line
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.280]   that runs across the page here.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.640]   And so let's say the couple's earning $80,000,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.400]   again, they can realize these gains on top of that
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.720]   and still thread the needle.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.680]   Let's assume that we're deducting a standard deduction
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.480]   here in 23,000, let's assume that we're deducting a 401(k),
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.120]   as long as you're below that taxable income threshold,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.720]   your wage income's gonna get taxed at roughly 12%,
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.840]   but your capital gains are gonna be taxed at 0%.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   Ben, that's a great way to thread that needle.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.200]   - If you are someone who has a variable income,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.040]   and your income could go up and down for whatever reason,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.680]   and you wanted to take these taxes,
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   it might make sense to sort of slow down your income
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.480]   this year if you could massage it in a way.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.600]   - Yeah, in a way, cash basis,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.720]   taxpayers have that option, right?
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.320]   You send out your invoices on December 30th, right?
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.000]   Nobody's gonna pay you the next day on New Year's Eve.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.440]   But the other thing to think about for Hadley
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.200]   is last year or this year, depending on when we're executing,
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.720]   I mean, this year, obviously,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.280]   there's carnage, right,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.960]   in some of the same investment accounts, right?
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.320]   If you happen to have a cryptocurrency account,
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.400]   if you own Bitcoin or anything,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.040]   and you've held it for two to three years,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.600]   you're probably down 50% there.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.960]   So this matching, let's say you have Amazon and Apple,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.760]   great, I'm sure that you had other stocks
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.600]   that didn't do so well.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.480]   So realizing those capital losses to help offset the gains,
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.400]   that's another strategy.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.640]   - Duncan, maybe you can donate
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.600]   something beyond meat shares to this person
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.920]   and kind of help them out.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   - Yeah, on a gift basis transfer.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.080]   - I actually, I don't have many left,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.040]   so I don't have many left to give.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.440]   - You bailed, huh?
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.280]   - Yeah.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.160]   - And obviously, the way that we kind of try to do this
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.400]   is through direct indexing,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.720]   where you can set like a tax budget
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.280]   and do some tax loss harvesting.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.400]   But you're right, that requires a lot more planning
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.200]   and being thoughtful about where those losses
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.040]   are coming from in execution.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.960]   Yeah, it's a little hard.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.120]   - Is that a segue, Ben?
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.480]   - Sure, let's do another one.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.000]   Well, no, not quite, but let's do one more.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.840]   - Okay, so last but not least,
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.200]   we have a question from Ben.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.080]   This is a long one, but a good one,
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.560]   especially the first part.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.840]   Love Portfolio Rescue, love the compound.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.120]   No pressure, but if you answer this question on the podcast,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.000]   there will be a case of assorted California wine
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.440]   headed your direction.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.000]   - Ben knows the way to my heart, through red wine.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.560]   - Flattery will get you everywhere.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.680]   - I'm sold.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.760]   - I recently started a backdoor Roth IRA
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.800]   because I've run out of other tax,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.120]   other savings vehicles that make sense.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.680]   After the lesson of Peter Thiel
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.700]   with the $6 billion in tax-free gains,
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.560]   I'm thinking I should use my Roth IRA
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.440]   for the speculative end of my savings barbell.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.800]   Between a DB pension,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.920]   which I learned is defined benefit, right?
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.760]   - Yep, correct.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.320]   - I thought it was Deutsche Bank.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.560]   Between a DB pension and pre-tax savings,
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.520]   my retirement income is already safe.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.640]   I was thinking of going for riskier stock bets
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.840]   in the Roth IRA,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.160]   but it seems that any stock that goes to zero
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.820]   is a hard loss with no tax loss harvesting available.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.920]   Is that correct?
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.600]   What else should I take into account
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.160]   when it comes to allocating money in my Roth IRA?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.000]   I just wanna make sure I don't chase a tax-free return
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.460]   and end up losing a capital loss
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.380]   I could take in my brokerage account.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.960]   - So the typical rule from my voice heard, Bill,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.300]   is that you want your sort of income-producing assets
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.140]   in your tax-free account,
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.840]   so bonds and REITs and that sort of stuff,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.760]   maybe in the Roth or traditional IRA.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.360]   Maybe your more indexed funds and ETFs
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.040]   that are more tax-efficient in the brokerage account
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.440]   if you're gonna separate it out that way
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.380]   in terms of asset location.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.560]   But I have heard a number of people say,
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.160]   "Well, I'm taking a swing.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.420]   "I wanna have some home-run swings.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.640]   "I wanna invest in venture capital
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.160]   "or some other sort of crypto or whatever it is."
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.680]   And if there ends up being this huge gain,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.640]   I want it in a Roth,
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.860]   so that way it's just tax-free when I get out of there.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.460]   They see the Peter Thiel thing.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.000]   In theory, that kind of makes sense to me,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.040]   but do you think it's unrealistic for most people to think,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.560]   "I'm gonna hit a grand slam"?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.760]   - Yeah, I think this would work.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   This would work, Ben.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.000]   Great name, by the way.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.340]   Good guy, I noticed, named Ben.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.600]   This would work to the extent
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.200]   that you can predict accurately
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.520]   which assets are going to outperform
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.000]   and which are gonna underperform, right?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.140]   And so if you have the ability for foresight,
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.480]   like I guess our zero-to-one guy, Peter Thiel,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.600]   to accurately forecast which those are, then yes.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.760]   Then you can asset locate and pick and choose,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.480]   and definitely, from the theoretical standpoint,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.880]   there's no better account for massive gains than a Roth
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.560]   because all the gains come out tax-free,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   assuming you can make it to age 60.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.720]   But Ben, like spilled wine,
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.680]   tax losses within a Roth IRA cannot be recovered.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.160]   That is the downside of tax-qualified accounts.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.960]   You get this benefit of appreciation and deferral,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.740]   but you do not get to realize any gains,
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.040]   and so that, to me, does not lend itself.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.260]   So to these types of investments.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.920]   The frame I like to use when I'm thinking about this
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.080]   is distribution of returns.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.320]   Ben, I know which image is coming to your head, right?
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.400]   It's this VC image of a concentrated bet
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.240]   of, let's say, 20 or 30 investments,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.840]   and in the kind of the VC private equity model,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.040]   in order to get those excess returns,
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.020]   those really good returns,
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.040]   you really only need a small number of those companies,
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.100]   but they need to be moonshots.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.800]   They need to go absolutely insane.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.480]   And that's the problem,
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.760]   that if you're trying to do that within a Roth IRA,
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.080]   I'm not certain that's the right vehicle
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.220]   in order for you to realize
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.800]   that kind of distribution of returns.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.560]   I think, Ben, you hit a key point.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.000]   Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   those are much better for income-producing assets.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.080]   I'm not certain that they're good for this type of moonshot
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.640]   because of what Ben is getting at.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.140]   So, Ben, what would you want?
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.080]   What would you want the perfect kind of investment to be?
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.440]   You would want it to have a couple of conditions
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.000]   from a tax perspective.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.760]   You would want it to be able to deduct any losses, right?
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.800]   So if it didn't work out,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.680]   you want to offset gains from elsewhere,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.440]   and you want gains to realize completely income tax-free,
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.400]   is there any investment from a tax perspective
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.880]   that fits that mold that you're aware of?
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.720]   - Sounds familiar, Bill.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.800]   - It sounds familiar.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.300]   I would point Mr. Ben to a Section 1202 kind of stock,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.120]   a qualified small business stock that has that feature
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.000]   of ultimately you're able to spread your bets,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   you're able to do all this sort of planning.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.420]   And if those companies don't work out,
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.960]   let's say you pick out 10 or 20,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.400]   you'll be able to realize the losses
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.600]   to offset gains from elsewhere.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.000]   And Section 1202 is this neat benefit
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.960]   that allows them to be completely income tax-free
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.640]   up to a gain of about $10 million,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   which again, we're not talking Peter Thiel money.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.960]   - If you're going to have this home run account,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.480]   whatever it is, whatever percentage of your portfolio,
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.560]   it's going to be your fund account, your speculative account,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.920]   you're probably going to have some losses
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.760]   to offset those gains.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.840]   So if you do hit it big, yeah.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.320]   Even if you hit one out of 10,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.120]   the other nine are probably going to either do nothing,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.200]   or especially if you are speculating.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.680]   So that, yes.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.840]   - So basically what you're getting at though
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.040]   is if you're going to put a bunch of speculative stocks
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.080]   in your Roth, you just want to make sure
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.200]   they're ones that go up.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.520]   - Yeah, that would be the key.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.360]   - Okay.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.240]   - But if we could talk really quickly,
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.640]   the Peter Thiel, Mitt Romney is the other individual
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.680]   in bank capital who pulled this off in the '90s with IRAs.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.200]   The way this happened, as far as I can understand,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.960]   is it was mostly, it was options,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.880]   and it was these sort of deep in the money options
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.360]   that they were able to contribute, basically,
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.000]   and buy within the IRA, and having some,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.040]   I wouldn't say foresight,
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.160]   but the ability to basically plan out
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.640]   five to 10 years in the future
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.520]   that these things were going to go insane in hog wild,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.680]   due to their efforts, by the way,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.000]   which is somewhat problematic,
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.960]   and might open them for some IRA scrutiny in the future.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.120]   That's how these things got really insane.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.320]   I'm not certain that type of option is really open to us
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.200]   that can't afford high-priced lawyers
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.480]   to kind of fight the IRS if this goes south.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.240]   So I think a more traditional approach
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.400]   to me would make more sense.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.480]   I would, if you can see connection,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.240]   I'm not sure that this kind of corporate pirate strategy
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.520]   is something that's available to us,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.160]   but maybe we're talking about the wine farm,
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.000]   you know, the vineyard here.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.160]   - Yes, I hate to be a Debbie Downer,
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.600]   and I don't want to lose out on my wine here,
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.520]   but just start with the baseline assumption
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.340]   that you're probably not Peter Thiel and Mitt Romney.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.000]   I think that's a pretty good starting point.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.760]   - Yeah, yeah, and I'm hoping it's Maybach.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.040]   I mean, honestly, California wines are,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.160]   in my opinion, top of the world, big fan.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.320]   Stag's Leap, and what's your favorite California red?
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.160]   I don't know, where are you at?
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.800]   - Any, any of them, anything.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.280]   - Any, any of them.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.600]   - I'll take a Pilsner, yeah.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.040]   - Ben's like, I like wine.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.000]   - Yeah.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.640]   - Pretty much, I'm not a wine snob.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.920]   - Equal opportunity employer.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.320]   - Our audience has been loving the tax questions.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.080]   We may even bring on both tax bills
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.480]   at some point in the future,
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.720]   because we've got so many.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.840]   - Don't forget about Bill Gates.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.960]   - You can ask us a question
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.600]   at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.540]   You don't even have to promise us alcohol.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.520]   We'll do it for free, we promise.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.040]   - I know, his comment, no pressure.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   I don't feel any pressure, this is fun.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.880]   I'm happy to be with you.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.960]   - All right, if you're watching on YouTube,

[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.460]   - Right, very excited.
