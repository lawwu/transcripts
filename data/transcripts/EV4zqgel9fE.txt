[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   - Hello, this is Gary Kim at the Shepherds Conference 2024,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.320]   and I'm here with Tom Buck.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.760]   Tom, can you just introduce yourself, your church?
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.120]   - Yes, I'm a senior pastor at First Baptist Church,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.000]   Lindale, Texas, and so glad to be with you today.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.320]   - And can you just share with us some of the highlights
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.080]   of your study using the LSB?
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200]   - Well, I use the Legacy Standard Bible exclusively,
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.880]   not only in my study, but in my preaching,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.240]   and then in our G3 Expository Preaching Workshops
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   where we train pastors how to preach the word.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.320]   And I am absolutely an advocate for the LSB
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.160]   through and through.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.320]   It's the only version that I use.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.240]   It's the only version I recommend, not just for pastors,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.040]   but for people in the pew as well.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.080]   And one of the major reasons for that
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.840]   is the just consistency that you find
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.840]   in the Legacy Standard Bible in the translation of the Greek.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.000]   I appreciate the fact that it makes sure
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120]   that as you're reading through the English translation
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.040]   that you have what is in the original language
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.920]   very clearly reflected in English text,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.040]   which you don't have sometimes often in other translations.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.560]   A good example is in 2 Timothy 3 where in the Greek
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.960]   it says, "But now, but now," in the Greek, "Sudea, sudea."
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.680]   Other translations don't translate that the same
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.480]   in both verses, even though the Greek is the same,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.880]   but the LSB does.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.080]   Now, why that's important, particularly in preaching,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.360]   is if you're gonna understand the point of the text,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.760]   you have to get the structure of the text right
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.920]   'cause that shows you what is being emphasized by the author
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.760]   and to understand that you need an English translation
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.960]   that will show that to you.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.560]   The LSB will more clearly show you the structure
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.820]   that's embedded in the original language
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.240]   than any other English translation that you get.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.660]   That's good for the preacher.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.240]   It's also good for the listener
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.600]   because then they see in their English text
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.880]   that I'm not just telling them the secret sauce
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.960]   that you have to know if you know the Greek,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   but they actually are getting a translation
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   that shows it to them right then and there,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.520]   so they'll learn to study their Bibles better.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.660]   Every pastor needs an LSB for their study.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.640]   Every pastor, in my opinion, should use it when they preach
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.200]   if what they wanna demonstrate to those listening
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.280]   is that their authority is coming from the text
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.200]   and not their own ideas.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   - Hey, Tom, thank you so much for stopping by.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.320]   Appreciate you, brother.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.960]   Take care. - You too, thank you.
