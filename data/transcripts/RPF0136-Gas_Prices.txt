[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.240]   what's going to happen in the future.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.780]   So today we're going to talk about that.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.580]   I'm going to lead off with an article here
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.720]   from the Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.520]   I also have, let's see, Bloomberg Business Week
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.580]   and LA Times.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280]   Let's go with the Bloomberg article.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.960]   Headline, dateline is January 16, 2015.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200]   Headline, "Consumer prices in the United States
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.400]   drop the most in six years as fuel falls."
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.700]   The cost of living in the U.S. declined in December
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.840]   by the most in six years, reflecting a plunge
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.640]   in energy costs that's keeping inflation from rising
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   toward the Federal Reserve's goal.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.580]   The consumer price index dropped 0.4%,
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.120]   the biggest decline since December 2008,
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.280]   after falling 0.3% in November.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.520]   A Labor Department report showed Friday in Washington.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.260]   The median forecast of 89 economists surveyed
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.300]   by Bloomberg called for a 0.4% decline,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400]   excluding volatile food and fuel.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.240]   The so-called core measure was unchanged,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.500]   failing to rise for only the second time since 2010.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.140]   The biggest drop in clothing costs since 1998,
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.540]   combined with falling airfares and cheaper new
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.980]   and used cars, signal the deceleration
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.280]   in inflation is spreading beyond energy,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   as Japan and Europe are in or near a recession,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.060]   and some emerging markets cool.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.860]   Sustained broad-based price declines test
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.660]   Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's view
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.540]   that the drop in fuel won't reverberate through the economy.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.340]   "This is a number that consumers will love,
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.140]   but economists will worry about," said Russell Price,
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140]   senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Incorporated
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.480]   in Detroit, who correctly projected the year-over-year
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.440]   change in the core index.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.940]   As plunging commodity prices, quote,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.420]   "filter through the system, it should take nine months
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.980]   to a year, then we should start to see inflation
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.560]   in the United States and around the world
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.320]   start to pick back up," close quote.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.700]   CPI estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.200]   from a 0.8% drop to a 0.1% advance.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.700]   Now, isn't that interesting?
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.280]   How's that for a headline for Friday?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   By the way, don't you just love the horrific nature
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.420]   of economic news that, well, consumers are happy,
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.560]   but this is a number that consumers will love,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   but economists will worry about.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.220]   Don't you love that?
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.000]   So sad, poor economists.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.260]   But as I record this show at the moment,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.960]   at 3.32 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   the S&P 500 index is currently sitting at 2010.91 points,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.440]   up almost 18.5 points for the day,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 17,447 points,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.040]   up 126 points, almost about 3/4 of 1% for the day.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.540]   So isn't this a fun day?
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.440]   And I decided to preempt the Q&A show
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.560]   since I did three Q&A shows earlier this week,
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.460]   and we're gonna talk a little bit about economics today.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.720]   And I hope you find it important
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.260]   'cause I think you need to know what's gonna happen
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.460]   in the future.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.220]   And I'm gonna share that with you today.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.420]   Decided to do some crowdsourcing
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.500]   and did some informal polling
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.540]   among the Radical Personal Finance Facebook community.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.800]   I shot a quick video and put it out on the Facebook page,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.740]   asking all of you to let me know,
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.340]   what is your general feeling about the economy right now?
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.340]   Do you feel good?
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.440]   Do you feel like it's in a good shape or a bad shape
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   or kind of neutral about it?
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   And I wasn't necessarily looking for any kind of economic,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.240]   indicator or any statistical analysis,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.840]   just wanted to know how you felt.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.240]   And the majority of the responses that I received
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.840]   corroborated my own, I guess, hypothesis
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.120]   would be the right word,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   that everyone feels pretty good right now, really do.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.760]   My primary indicator for everybody feeling good
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.120]   is actually my Facebook feed.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   I personally measure economic data
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.840]   based upon my Facebook feed.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.080]   And I see, well, what are people talking about on Facebook?
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.400]   And I've been fascinated to watch
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.680]   the gasoline price updates.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   And my Facebook feed, and maybe yours as well,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.920]   has just been packed with people
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   taking pictures of the price that they're paying at the pump.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.880]   And I saw one recently,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.200]   it was something like $1.88 a gallon or $1.89 a gallon
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.000]   that somebody is paying for their gasoline.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.320]   And I just thought, wow.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.400]   I personally, I was surprised
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.360]   'cause I really did never expect to see
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.120]   gasoline under $2 a gallon in my lifetime.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.520]   And what an interesting turn of events.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.080]   I certainly didn't predict it.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.600]   But here, quoting from an LA Times article that I have here,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.480]   that evidently the American Automobile Association, AAA,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.280]   says that on Friday today,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.560]   a gallon of regular gas's average price is $2.08
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.720]   across the country.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.240]   Fascinating, down 4.7% last month,
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.040]   the largest decline since December of 2008.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   So, where are we in the economic cycle?
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.520]   That's usually what people would ask.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.560]   And I'll tell you, by my informal polling,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.920]   everything feels pretty good.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.600]   Stock prices are high, gasoline is low.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.440]   That leads to a good amount of disposable income
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.240]   for many people.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.640]   And so, when I start to feel pretty good,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.840]   then I immediately recognize that I have a need
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.920]   to warn people against the other side.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.280]   See, one of the most valuable services
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   that I believe a financial advisor can provide for anybody
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.400]   is essentially to talk to you
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.720]   and talk you off of the ledges.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.480]   For example, in portfolio management,
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.800]   the biggest influence and the biggest factor
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.360]   on the performance of your investment portfolio is you.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.920]   What do you actually do
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.160]   with regard to your investment portfolio?
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.040]   And there are various aspects to it.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.540]   Number one, do you fund it?
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.400]   Do you save money?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   Number two, what do you do when things are good
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.720]   or things are not good?
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.500]   And so, a primary skill of a good financial advisor
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.420]   needs to be, in essence, to help people help you
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.160]   to manage your emotions.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.740]   And so, when everyone's euphoric, I get to be bearish,
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.080]   and when everyone's bearish, I get to be encouraging.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.120]   And so, today, I'm gonna share with you a few thoughts
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.020]   that I'd like you to consider as far as some things
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.360]   that I think might be helpful for you
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.960]   at this phase of the economic and business cycle.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   And I've had a few different influences on my thinking.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.200]   Interestingly, two things came together
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.360]   on the show recently.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.960]   I answered yesterday, the day before yesterday,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.800]   I answered the question from Banika from Sri Lanka.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.180]   And I hadn't, I've never been to Sri Lanka,
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.280]   but I was, the last time I really ever thought
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.660]   about the country of Sri Lanka prior to receiving his email
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.660]   or was in 2004, when the tsunami hit that part of Asia
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:31.760]   and brought widespread, massive devastation
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.880]   to that part of Asia.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.040]   And I was thinking about this because this week,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.800]   I've been watching some Hurricane Katrina documentaries.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.920]   And what's interesting about both of these
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.440]   two natural disasters is I was traveling for both of them.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   When the 2004 tsunami hit India, excuse me, not India.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.140]   Well, I guess it did hit India a little bit.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.900]   It was primarily Indonesia, and then also Sri Lanka
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.780]   and Thailand and some in India.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.420]   But when in 2004, when that tsunami struck,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.660]   I was actually in Hong Kong over the Christmas
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.060]   and New Year's holiday.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.060]   And it was a unique experience for me to be in another,
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.140]   to be in Hong Kong watching the news come in
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.180]   much closer to it than I would have felt perhaps
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.260]   if I had been in the United States at the time.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.700]   And then Hurricane Katrina, I was in Costa Rica
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.580]   for the duration of Hurricane Katrina.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.440]   So I really didn't have any personal impact,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.980]   any personal connection to Katrina.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.900]   I didn't watch the news.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.660]   I heard something about a hurricane
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.980]   that was going on in the United States,
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.620]   but I was pretty unplugged at that point.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.180]   And so I didn't have any of the connection
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.520]   that most US Americans had with the event.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.540]   And obviously I saw discussions of it.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.480]   But after going to New Orleans a few months ago for a visit,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.140]   I decided I wanted to learn a little bit about it.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.540]   So I've been watching some documentaries,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.720]   and just so happened this week,
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.880]   I finally was able to get to them
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.620]   and see some documentaries.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.000]   And it just was an interesting thing to think about,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.840]   what would I do?
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.500]   'Cause that's where my brain always goes,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.720]   is how would I plan for this financially?
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.060]   What would I do if I were living in a place
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.420]   that was just completely devastated?
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.600]   How would my plans, my financial plans survive?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.100]   Would I be able to get through it?
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.040]   Would I be able to prosper through it?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.580]   Would I be able to help others?
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.340]   How would my planning hold up in this event?
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.180]   And so thinking about the tsunami,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.700]   thinking about Katrina, thinking about gas prices,
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.700]   and then thinking about just this economic phase
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.960]   that we're in, made me decide to do this show.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.560]   And the theme of today's show,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.120]   which I hope to develop in three different ways,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.440]   is you need to be out of sync with the rest of the world
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.560]   in order to succeed.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   And the three themes that I want to develop today are,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.360]   the three are, one, now's the time to begin preparing,
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.740]   if you haven't, for global recession.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.480]   When things are feeling good, you should be preparing
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.440]   for when things aren't so good.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.640]   And when things aren't so good,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.360]   you should be preparing for when things are good.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.920]   Because guess what?
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.560]   There are difficult times coming.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.320]   If I suckered you into listening to the show
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.080]   because you were hoping for me to give you
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.360]   a prognostication on the fact that we're going to be
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.440]   in global recession in 2015, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.840]   but the English language can be tricky sometimes.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.600]   You have to read carefully.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   I didn't say that necessarily,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.960]   although you certainly could interpret it this way,
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.360]   I didn't say that 2015 will have global recession
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.440]   and we'll have $20 per gallon gas.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.960]   But I did say that you need to prepare in 2015
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.440]   for a global recession at $20 per gallon gas.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.340]   Because I view those two things as inevitable.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.860]   In the future, there will be a global recession.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.440]   And in the future, we will be paying for $20 a gallon gas.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.860]   Or more, who knows?
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.500]   Now, on what basis do I say that?
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.500]   Well, in my short lifetime, which is fewer than 30 years,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.920]   I clearly remember paying for gas that was under a dollar.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.460]   And also in my lifetime, I've paid for gas
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.200]   that was over $4.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   So a fourfold increase from a dollar to $4
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.760]   within my lifetime leads me to believe
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.760]   that it's certainly not even,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.400]   wouldn't even be the least bit surprising
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.640]   to experience another fourfold increase
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.120]   in the coming decades.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.620]   And fourfold increase from $3 or $4 a gallon
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.380]   gets you pretty close to 20.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.660]   So now's the time to be preparing
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.260]   for times of economic hardship.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.340]   And now's the time to prepare for recession,
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.140]   'cause it's coming.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.660]   That's the first thing.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.340]   Number two is now's the time to be taking advantage
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.860]   of where we are in the economic cycle
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.400]   and the business cycle.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.340]   This is the time.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.780]   And I'll get to that.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.780]   And then number three is,
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.060]   let's talk about gas prices at the end.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.960]   We'll wrap up with some impact of how
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.260]   if gas prices are affecting your budget,
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.860]   maybe we should talk about that.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.880]   One of the keys for wisdom is to be able
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.820]   to look forward and see the future and see what's coming.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.260]   Now, certainly I'm not prescient enough
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.900]   to know everything that's coming exactly when.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.240]   But, and one of my favorite sayings,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.780]   I think it was Zig Ziglar who popularized it,
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.420]   is he said, "In general, economists have successfully
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.780]   "predicted the last 11," or excuse me,
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.080]   "have successfully predicted all 11
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.940]   "of the last three recessions," or something like that.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.320]   We're prone to look for, or wired in some way,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.340]   to look for bad news and to look for problems.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.940]   But one of the things that we can do
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.700]   is we can plan for those.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.400]   And now's the time to be planning.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.860]   Now's the time to be planning when things are easy.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.340]   The best example of this would be something like insurance.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.020]   I come from a background of being an insurance salesperson,
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.540]   and so this is intimately familiar to me.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.260]   My heart sinks when I read things from people
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.380]   or hear a notification that Joe was just diagnosed
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.480]   with cancer, or Susie just had a heart attack.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.980]   Those things make my stomach drop
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.100]   because I just, as a financial advisor,
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.600]   I immediately think, were they ready?
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.580]   Were they ready?
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.260]   Did they do what they needed to do when times were good?
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.300]   Insurance is one of those tricky things
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.700]   that you gotta buy it when you don't need it.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.740]   You gotta buy it when you're strapping and healthy
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.500]   and just in great shape and you have no risk factors.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.620]   That's the time that you have to buy it.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.180]   And the time when you're most desperate to have it,
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.180]   when you most desperately need it, you can't get it.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.900]   It takes a remarkable amount of maturity and forethought
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.900]   and planning and vision to be able to look forward
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.180]   to the future and do something
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.780]   that lowers your consumption now
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.860]   so that in the future you will be able to be protected.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.300]   And that's what insurance is.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   But if you can apply that maturity of thought
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.740]   to every aspect of your life,
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.260]   then you can start to smooth out some of the bumps
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.860]   that so many people go through.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.820]   And then because you can smooth out some of the bumps,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.820]   you'll be able to help some other people
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.700]   smooth out the bumps in their lives.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.060]   Do the planning now that you need to do
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.180]   while things are easy.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.500]   And I wanna challenge you this weekend,
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.420]   if you're listening to this on Friday or Saturday
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.780]   or whenever, I wanna challenge you to do some thinking
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.240]   about what you can do and what you need to be doing
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.620]   in your life to prepare for the next global recession.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.080]   'Cause there will be one.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.720]   We have no idea on the timing,
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.700]   but there certainly will be one at some point.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.160]   And if you'll plan now and build the things
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.840]   that you need to do now,
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.720]   then you will be able to get through it.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.480]   I'd like to give you this as an exercise.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.700]   And let me give you the question
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.060]   and then ask you to pause and actually think it through.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.420]   Pause the recording and just give it some thought
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.540]   and think of some of your ideas.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.300]   And then I'll share some of mine.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.260]   If you wanna do this as a journaling exercise,
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.180]   that'd be great too.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.140]   Oftentimes though, our lives are so fast paced
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.340]   that if we don't at least just think through it,
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.260]   it's unlikely that you'll remember to do this later.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.500]   But the question is this.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.280]   What would happen if your,
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.740]   what will your life look like
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.740]   if we go into a global recession that is fairly severe?
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.460]   Could be recession, depression, whatever.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.800]   Let's just call it recession for now, keep it short.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.240]   Global recession that's fairly severe
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   and your employer has to lower their workforce
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.640]   by 20 to 30% and you get fired.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:25.100]   And because of the severe nature of the global recession,
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.900]   you are unable to find a job for let's say a year
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.940]   and you're gonna be out of work for a year.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.800]   Or if you are a business owner,
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.220]   then let's assume that your profits are measurably affected.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.880]   You suffer a, let's call it a 50% decline in your sales
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.980]   and you have to deal with that for a year.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.000]   What would you do?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.260]   If you are married,
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.780]   pretend that you and your spouse both lose your job
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.680]   at the same time.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.340]   What would your plan be?
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.340]   Now here's where I'll encourage you just to pause
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.820]   and I'm gonna continue on,
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.620]   but go ahead and take a moment
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.420]   and think about what you would do
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.980]   and then add to that thought.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.860]   What would the world be like?
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.620]   Think about what would you actually be going through
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.900]   and then think what are the things
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.060]   that I could be doing today
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.060]   that would help me to get through that situation
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.580]   a little bit better.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.740]   And I'll go ahead and pause now,
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.020]   so feel free to pause and think through that scenario.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:42.400]   Now, I hope you came up with your list.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.900]   This truly is a valuable exercise.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.220]   The most valuable thing about the exercise
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.140]   if you actually do it,
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.420]   is that it opens your mind to a possibility
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.940]   that most people don't think about.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.700]   Most people when they're fired are shocked by it
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.740]   and they've not thought about what they would actually do
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.500]   and what they're going to do.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.060]   I remember the time I was fired from a job,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.820]   I don't know what language to use, fired, laid off.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.940]   I guess it's fired, maybe I'll use the word fired
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.900]   when we talk about for cause 'cause you were a dumb dumb
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.220]   and did something that deserved determination of your job,
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.860]   laid off, general conditions
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.140]   that affect more than one person.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.060]   So I'll use those words.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.740]   So I guess I was laid off.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.340]   And I remember just how utterly shocking it was to me
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.260]   because I thought I had done everything that I needed to do.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.620]   I was a star employee, I received glowing,
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.200]   I thought I was, I received glowing reports,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.500]   I had just gotten a raise, all these things.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.140]   And then I just remember sitting in that office just stunned
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.340]   because I thought it would never happen to me.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.300]   And I think that's how most of us go through life
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.420]   is we think, "Oh, it'll never happen to me.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.420]   "It'll happen to somebody else."
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.500]   But realistically, statistically,
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.220]   it's massively likely to happen to you and to me.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.580]   The only thing that would make it unlikely
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.580]   is if we have more of the reins of our own destiny
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.460]   and we're self-employed in some way.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.300]   And in that scenario, it's massively likely
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.780]   that something will happen
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:21.100]   that will measurably impact our business revenues
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.320]   and profitability.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.740]   Just happens in most businesses at some point in time.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.420]   So because people are shocked,
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.020]   what happens is oftentimes people don't know what to do.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.780]   And it's nice that many large firms have,
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.240]   try to come up with these transition plans
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.360]   and help people with career coaches and resume coaches
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.140]   and these kinds of things, that's nice.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.880]   But the reality is most people don't work
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.860]   for large companies that are gonna put those resources.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.460]   Most people work for small companies
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.000]   and the small employer feels awful about it,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.800]   but has to care for what they're trying to do.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.620]   If you'll force yourself to do the hard work
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.500]   of thinking something through in advance,
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.500]   it will prepare your mind for it
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.600]   and it'll prepare you for solutions.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.820]   And I call this war gaming.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.220]   If you think about it, if you look at training
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.240]   for any kind of event in which there's going
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.180]   to be intense pressure, the pros,
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.660]   the world-class professionals in any field
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.880]   go through a period of training
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.980]   where they think about what's going to happen
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.800]   and they role play it.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.700]   So whether that's a field of athletic competition
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.460]   on an individual basis, an individual athlete,
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.900]   as part of their training, they will think through
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.780]   the scenario they're gonna perform, their routine.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.140]   They'll go through it again and again
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.660]   and again and again mentally.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.860]   If it's some kind of race course,
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.300]   maybe a slalom course or something,
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.060]   they'll think it through every aspect of their body
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.940]   very, very carefully.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.900]   It's important for high performance.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.420]   If you are on a team sport, you'll think through
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.780]   what's this gonna be like.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.060]   If you are in the military, you'll train again
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.340]   and again and again for various situations.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.340]   If you're on a SWAT team, you see them in the movies,
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.340]   you know, the SWAT guys breaching the door,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.940]   practicing again and again and again
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.500]   so that by the time you're actually doing it for real,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.740]   you've gone through it many, many times.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.460]   If you're a firefighter, part of your training,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.380]   you're in a burning building, what do you do?
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.280]   How does this work?
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.340]   And you go through it so that when the real thing happens,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.260]   you aren't caught blindsided by it.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.340]   Well, we need to apply that to our own lives
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.740]   and think, what would I do in that scenario?
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.060]   I know for me, I had some experiences
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.900]   as a financial planner in the last recession in 2008
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.420]   that were really tough for me
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.860]   is because as I watched the,
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.180]   'cause economic malaise linger on
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.900]   and there are those who would say it's still lingering.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.100]   That's not my point today.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.420]   But as I watched things linger on,
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.960]   I saw people be affected that never thought
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.020]   they were gonna be affected.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.700]   And as I watched people go through a job loss,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.620]   what I noticed was that many times
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.820]   they weren't able emotionally to deal
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.720]   with the reality of the job loss.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:18.500]   Specifically, remember one prospective client.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.380]   This person never became a client,
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.660]   but he was laid off from a job
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.940]   that he'd had for several decades.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.420]   And he was in a crucial point of life
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.900]   where he was living a high lifestyle
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.140]   as a well-paid executive,
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.220]   was living in a beautiful house in a ritzy part of town,
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.900]   kids in private school, private high school,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.220]   which is a very expensive period of a parent's life.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.140]   And so he was doing well income-wise,
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.840]   but his expenses were rather high.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.740]   And then most of, due to the financial planning
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.020]   that's taught, he wasn't extremely affluent,
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.700]   but the assets that he did have
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.060]   were primarily tucked aside in retirement accounts
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   and with minimal accessibility for actual cashflow.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.060]   And as I watched him go through the just intense emotion
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.960]   of trying to figure out what do I do?
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.020]   How do I take my, do I take my kids out of school
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.780]   and suffer the embarrassment
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.940]   of walking into the private school and saying,
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.740]   I'm sorry, I can't afford the tuition anymore.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.420]   Do I put my house on the market?
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.420]   It just was clearly something that was overwhelming for him
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.700]   'cause he'd never thought about it.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.860]   And so because he'd never really thought about it,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.500]   he'd become so comfortable
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   in his middle executive lifestyle,
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.900]   he'd become so comfortable that there wasn't,
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.320]   he couldn't conceive of the thought
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.980]   of essentially starting over.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.820]   And he didn't have much of the great planning in place
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.420]   necessary to be able to maintain his lifestyle.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.300]   And as I watched many people personally
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.540]   and also vicariously through reading
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.780]   about different people's experiences,
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.120]   one of the things I've noticed
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.260]   that when people get fired,
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.380]   oftentimes they wait too long
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.380]   to start making changes in their lifestyle.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.900]   Now I'll make my statement, I recognize there are caveats,
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.020]   but I think that if you get laid off or if you get fired,
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.780]   the most important thing that you can do
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:22.160]   is immediately cut things to the bare bones,
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.960]   immediately,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.520]   because you don't know how long it's gonna last.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   Now I recognize that there may be exceptions to that.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.460]   There may be intelligent,
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.020]   there may be an intelligent course of action
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.740]   to finish out a school year or finish out this
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.140]   or finish out something else.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.300]   And with good planning,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.620]   hopefully you're not right on the edge
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.860]   such that you gotta have to sell the house right away.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.860]   But I think, and so I recognize that that is true,
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.980]   but my point is that by taking drastic action immediately,
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.020]   it sets your mind in the right place.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.980]   If you don't adjust your lifestyle,
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.980]   it's easy just to simply feel as though,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.340]   well, I'm just gonna go on with my life,
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.300]   everything's gonna be perfect,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.740]   I'm gonna find a job in months, month, month, month,
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.240]   months later, and all of a sudden we wind up deeply in debt,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.620]   no money, no assets,
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.960]   and now it takes years to dig out of that,
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.780]   where if we just cut back immediately
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.920]   and cut our lifestyle immediately,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.020]   then you can be better off.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.860]   So here would be the question.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.620]   If you were fired, if you were laid off
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.040]   and you knew that you weren't going to have a job
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.940]   for the next year, what would you cut?
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.780]   How could you get down to the bare bones?
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.620]   What would be the bare bones?
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.860]   What's your backup plan?
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.780]   What would be the plan if you knew you were going
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.140]   to be out of work for three months, six months,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.780]   12 months, 24 months?
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.420]   Remember, they extended the unemployment stuff to 99 weeks.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.820]   What would happen if you were out of work for two years?
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:07.180]   Now, use that thought process and think about it,
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.940]   and you'll come up with the right answers for you.
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.940]   I don't know what they are.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.280]   I have ideas for me, but that's for me.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.820]   What would they be for you?
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.740]   What would you need?
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.100]   Now, here's the next part of that.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.980]   What would you need to do today to prepare for that?
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.060]   So certainly, if you have resources built up,
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.400]   if you have cash, it's a simple example, savings,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.860]   that can help hugely.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.060]   If you have liquid cash that can just simply be tapped,
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.100]   that's a massive help.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.420]   If you have a low-cost lifestyle, low fixed costs,
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   minimal fixed debt obligations, minimal high,
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.260]   you have just low lifestyle costs, that can help you hugely.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.560]   If you have a high savings rate,
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.980]   then that automatically implies that you have
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.580]   a lower-cost lifestyle in proportion to your actual income.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.540]   Even if you do have a high-cost lifestyle,
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.780]   do you have a high fixed-cost lifestyle
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.200]   or a high discretionary-cost lifestyle?
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:16.060]   As an example, two people could be spending $8,000 a month,
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.940]   $10,000 a month.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.780]   I don't know what number.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.820]   I mean, it's hard to know on a general show like this
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.660]   what number to use.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.940]   Let's just pick $10,000 a month.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.860]   But for one person, that $10,000 a month
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.160]   is just a basic standard of living.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.180]   This is, let's call it, $4,000 a month mortgage,
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.340]   principal and interest taxes and insurance costs
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.060]   of an overhead on a house.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.300]   Let's call it $600 a month for a car payment.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.260]   Another $500 a month for another car payment
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.580]   would be about normal in that kind of lifestyle,
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.640]   at least where I live.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:55.340]   You would have a high utility costs, call it $500 a month.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:01.060]   High, just embedded costs to the lifestyle.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.660]   Now, it's very different than another person
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.940]   whose fixed costs are $3,000 a month,
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.780]   but they're spending $10,000 a month
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.800]   on things that they enjoy
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.380]   that they could easily pull out of.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.420]   There are no contracts involved, no commitments.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.820]   They don't have to finish out the lease payment.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.940]   You could just adjust much more quickly.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.240]   So being flexible and being adjustable
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.100]   is a massive benefit in that situation.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.040]   You might wanna consider having some cash on hand.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.260]   You might wanna consider having some of the things
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.100]   stored up that you would need to buy.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.240]   This is one of those scenarios
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.740]   where it might be useful for you to have some reserves.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.840]   I don't know what that is.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.080]   I bulk buy razors, so it would be,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.120]   to shave with, I haven't shaved in a few months,
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.760]   but I still have lots of razors.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.400]   I guess I don't have to buy razors,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.840]   but the point is that if you have the things
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.280]   that you need and use regularly
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.760]   and you have them in supply, that gives you flexibility.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.400]   So we talked about the alpha strategy.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.020]   Talked about that in previous shows.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.260]   Now, here'd be the more useful things.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.340]   Could you get a job quickly?
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.260]   And what would be required to get a job quickly?
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.140]   Well, I would suggest that would be
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.460]   where the care and feeding of your social network
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.920]   would be important.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   Do you have a list, whether it's just mental or real,
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.000]   I'm not, I don't think that most people
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.840]   are gonna have a list of here
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.120]   are the first 10 people I would call,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.960]   but who are the first 10 people that you would call?
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.120]   I remember I didn't, I wasn't smart enough to plan for it,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.600]   but I'll just share one personal anecdote.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   It was kind of happens accidental,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.200]   but I remember there's one job
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.680]   that I've been legitimately fired from in my life,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.040]   and it was kind of,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.300]   I don't know if it was legitimately fired.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.140]   It wasn't working for me,
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.980]   and it wasn't working for my boss,
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.580]   and we both figured it out concurrently,
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.580]   and we agreed in a meeting, like,
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.820]   listen, this isn't working.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.740]   I was working in a print shop at the time.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.220]   And I remember leaving there,
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.380]   and I finished around 11.30 in the morning.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.660]   It just was clear it wasn't working,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.260]   and I was driving home.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.460]   It was in, I think it was in college.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.820]   And I was driving home, and I didn't know what to do.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.260]   So I was like, I don't know, I don't have a backup plan.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.180]   So I pick up my phone,
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.480]   and I called the boss that I had worked for
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.420]   at the company I had worked for the previous summer.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.580]   And it was like, absolutely,
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.740]   come and have lunch with me tomorrow.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.340]   And I had a job by the next day.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.660]   And I just thought, wow,
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.500]   I didn't intend to put that in place.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.580]   I wasn't smart enough to do that.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.660]   But the reality was that it was nice to have a backup plan,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.300]   and I had a job the next day.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.440]   It's pretty cool.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.020]   Now, from this perspective, a few more years now,
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.400]   I look at that, and I say, that's important.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.020]   So I need to be planning for that.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.420]   I need to know who are the people that I would call.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.520]   Who are the people that I've done good work for?
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.220]   Can I go back to every single one of my bosses,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.700]   and would they rehire me?
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.120]   Would they rehire you?
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.620]   If you needed a job, could you call any of your former bosses
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.620]   and would they be glad to have you back?
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.300]   I hope so.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.580]   For me, I hope it is.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.420]   I think it is.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.240]   I mean, I've never tested it,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.700]   'cause most of the times I don't really wanna go back
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.300]   to things I've done before.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.420]   But it's nice to have that,
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.740]   that if I needed to support my family,
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.820]   I could just immediately call at least a list of,
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.980]   for me, 20 or so different former bosses.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.700]   So that means today, while I'm happily employed
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.860]   and times are good and gas prices are low,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.780]   I need to be working hard and being indispensable at my job,
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.460]   which incidentally will probably help me
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.860]   to avoid being fired,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.860]   but that's not the point of this mental exercise.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.220]   It is one of the things I need to be doing.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.060]   I need to be indispensable so that I'm not on that list.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   I need to be working hard and building things up now.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.860]   But having that social network,
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.440]   knowing, staying in touch with people,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.100]   having simple things like contact information.
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:56.500]   I was that nerd in high school,
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.220]   and I hope this doesn't sound too self-important.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.020]   My goal is not to do that.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.780]   I'm just talking out of what I do know
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.100]   and what I've learned.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.380]   I was that nerd in high school that,
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.300]   since the time I graduated high school,
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.660]   I don't think I've lost anybody's contact information
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:11.780]   that I ever met.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.660]   And it just was all accumulated and accumulated
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.340]   and accumulated over time.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.180]   That has served me so many times
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:24.140]   to be able to pull up a list of people
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.900]   that I've had some contact with
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.580]   that I could reach out to and ask for help.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.420]   Could reach out to, and if I needed to create a job,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.300]   at this point, there's 5,000 people in my cell phone,
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.080]   and that I could go through there one by one
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.540]   and make 5,000 phone calls,
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.180]   and I bet that within the first couple hundred,
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.260]   I would have a list of opportunities.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.060]   I might have to go and completely relearn
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.980]   some new industry, some new skill, some new something,
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.100]   but I could at least find out
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.420]   about some kind of opportunities,
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.420]   and that's a much more efficient way
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.020]   to approach a job search than just going on
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.720]   whatever the jobsearch.com site of the day happens to be.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:08.380]   So giving care and feeding to your social network,
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.720]   helping people, serving people, giving.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.500]   Serving is the key thing, serving people in advance,
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.140]   and being excellent, being trustworthy,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.100]   being honest, being forthright, being dependable.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.100]   These are all things that really matter.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.620]   What skills do you have or could you develop now
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.620]   that would help you?
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:35.500]   If you have sales skills, and I have sales skills,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.760]   I could take those sales skills
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.420]   and I could transfer them to another market.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.260]   A good salesperson is always,
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.300]   there's always an opportunity for a good salesperson.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.140]   That was what attracted me
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.900]   to the sales field in the first place.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.060]   Every business lives and dies based upon top-line revenue.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.900]   I mean, that drives more than anything else.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.260]   If you got enough top-line revenue,
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.180]   you can figure out the stuff in the middle
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.460]   to get to the bottom-line profit,
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.840]   but if you don't have top-line revenue,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.820]   there's very little else that you can do
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.420]   until you can build that, and that's sales.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.180]   That's a key skill, sales and marketing skills.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.840]   What skills do you have that you could transfer?
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.800]   Have you developed them to a high level of proficiency?
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.500]   Could you develop them to a high level of proficiency?
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.540]   If you get used to developing them,
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.880]   you often won't need them,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.220]   but sometimes I hurt so much when I think of people
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.980]   that are close to me and I care about
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.100]   that need work, need a job, need something,
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.440]   and they'd say, "Well, I need work."
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.620]   I think, "Well, what skills do you have?"
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.860]   I ask them, "What skills do you have?"
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.940]   "I don't know," or if you just have one or two skills.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.180]   We've gotta keep our skills current.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.380]   We've gotta continually be expanding our skills,
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.260]   and they need to be diverse.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.900]   Yes, they need to go deep in certain areas,
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.100]   but if we're only just deep in one thing
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.980]   and the market moves on and that one thing
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.980]   either is out of style or is just simply
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.180]   too crowded of a market, we've gotta be able
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.500]   to be flexible and transition.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.040]   The world of the future, the economic situation
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.900]   that we're facing in the future is far different
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.080]   than the past, and one of those key things
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.840]   is flexibility, flexibility, flexibility.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.260]   In addition to the skills, what resources do you have
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.380]   that you could employ?
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:23.380]   Many people are just so, my observation,
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.920]   many people are so uptight and so proud
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.060]   of doing what they do that they don't think
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.940]   to of all the resources and all the skills
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.660]   that they could apply.
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.300]   Sitting in my garage at the moment,
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.660]   I've got at least a dozen businesses
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.820]   that I've got the basic tools and equipment for
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.580]   that I could use to feed my family.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.260]   I've got a pressure washer sitting out there.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.300]   I could go and start a job pressure washing roofs.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.640]   Down here in Florida, we've got the moss
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.700]   that grows all over our roofs, and I could
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.180]   just walk around and pressure wash roofs.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.680]   That's pressure washers, the foundation
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.160]   of a car cleaning business, of a siding business,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.840]   of going around, and in my neighborhood,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.200]   we've got these horrible rust stains,
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.360]   and I can talk about, I don't actually
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.960]   have pressure clean them off my house.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.200]   I shouldn't say rust stains.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   Point is, pressure cleaner is money.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.020]   Is it a lot?
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.200]   No, but there's a little bit.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.320]   There's a little bit.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.080]   I've got a lawnmower.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.720]   I certainly could create a lawnmowing business.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.840]   People do it all the time here in Florida.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.360]   It's a pretty simple, straightforward business.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.480]   You just need some clients, and that's where
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.120]   the sales skills and those marketing skills
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.240]   and the ability to knock on 200 doors,
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.640]   300 doors in a day comes in, and out of it,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.400]   you talk to a few hundred people,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.300]   you're gonna find a handful of people that need something.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.920]   I've got all the basic tools of carpentry.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.560]   I've got some construction experience,
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.160]   these types of things, so even just
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.000]   that basic, straightforward, manual type of work,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.920]   you can create work, but if you don't have those skills,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.320]   this is where I've often felt sorry
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.720]   for some of the, and I'm so grateful that,
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.740]   again, it was due to no foresight of my own,
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.400]   but my father always worked to get me involved
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.080]   in all kinds of different jobs,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   and the best thing that he ever,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.000]   one of the great things he did for me
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.640]   was that I did a different job in a different industry
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.500]   every single summer, every single year
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.800]   from basically seventh grade on,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.880]   and you start to accumulate these diverse skills.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.720]   That helps so much.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.040]   Instead of me, when I've tried to do career counseling
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.280]   with some people, friends of mine that have needed it,
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.400]   I was like, "Well, what do you do?"
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.240]   I have one friend I care greatly about,
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.480]   but this friend was always involved
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   in one specific athletic sport,
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.740]   and in talking with him at one time,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.840]   I just realized that his entire life
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.600]   was overwhelmed with this one sport,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.480]   and he developed this world-class proficiency
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.000]   in one unique competitive sport,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.920]   but it left him so bereft of other useful skills
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.680]   that it's very tough for him to figure out,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.440]   okay, what are my career plans now?
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.340]   What industries can I transfer into?
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:11.860]   I commend just the thinking process to you,
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.640]   building up your skills, building up your resources,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.440]   the business resources, the tools of various trades,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.800]   the skills to apply them, the skills of learning,
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.220]   the social network to get the opportunity,
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.880]   and make sure you keep your expenses low.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.680]   If you keep your expenses low,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.880]   you can always have the opportunity.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.820]   You're not forced into a point of desperation.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:42.400]   It's certainly, there's certainly a big difference
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.900]   between if you can avoid lifestyle creep,
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.180]   or at least avoid the fixed lifestyle creep.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:53.440]   Most people can't, that are making a few hundred thousand
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.760]   dollars a year, they can't go and survive
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.220]   on half a hundred, 50 or 60 thousand dollars a year.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.580]   But if you can, that gives you so much confidence.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.360]   I remember talking to a prospective client one time,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.980]   who was a bond trader, made hundreds of thousands
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.080]   of dollars per year as a bond trader, no debt,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.920]   very low lifestyle expenses, just had the ability
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.440]   to go bag groceries at Publix,
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.760]   and it just really stuck out to me as a unique,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.560]   a unique scenario.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   How great is that, as far as a lifestyle consideration?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.000]   The last thing, lest I belabor this point too much,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   is having some kind of side business established now.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.120]   Something that you've built up now,
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.360]   that you could transition into.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.020]   And it's a lot easier to take a side business,
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.600]   that you have some ability with,
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.080]   and take something that's established
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.740]   to the equivalent of a full-time income,
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.160]   than it is to take something from zero
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.960]   to a full-time income.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.980]   So be working on that now, and building that up now,
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.320]   so that you have a backup plan.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.520]   If you start to put these things together,
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.360]   and you say, how can I be unfireable at my job,
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.240]   by being so incredibly valuable?
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.200]   That's the first thing, and I wouldn't rely on that,
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.160]   because things change.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.700]   Though you may be unfireable, the business may change.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.560]   Or the owner of the business might just simply decide,
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.740]   we're gonna go in a different direction.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.580]   That was what happened to me,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.380]   at the company I got laid off from.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.680]   We're changing the direction of the company.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.960]   And I didn't know they were preparing the company for sale,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.320]   and trying to adjust some things of the business operations.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.500]   So, makes sense to me now, but at the time,
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.140]   I was affected, and I didn't know what they were doing.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.940]   But the point is, be unfireable.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.920]   Be that person that is so valuable.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.780]   That starts today, by going to your boss and saying,
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.300]   what can I do that will help you?
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.700]   What can I do to improve your life?
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.740]   Give me more responsibility, please.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.540]   Ask for more responsibility.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.220]   Discharge that responsibility with honors,
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.180]   and ask for more.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.940]   Discharge that, ask for more.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.900]   Make sure you get into a part of your company
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.020]   that is economically productive.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.140]   You wanna be specifically in a place
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.460]   where you're either creating revenue, or cutting revenue.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.220]   You don't wanna be a cost.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.120]   It's much better to be in a place
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.360]   where there's a measurable contribution of your,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.200]   you can measure your contributions
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.040]   to the profit of the company.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.100]   This is what I, again, what I love about sales,
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.120]   is the salespeople, they work for free until they produce.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.760]   So, the cost of a salesperson is always less
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.800]   than the business that they bring in,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.360]   'cause they're paid on commission.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.240]   That's what's wonderful about sales.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.840]   You can always measure your production.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.560]   So, be unfireable now.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.040]   Build that network that you would need
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.520]   to get another job quickly.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:49.820]   That's a key thing to focus on.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.080]   That's where the networking comes in.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.500]   That's where being involved in the industry.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.460]   That's where being involved in an industry.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.020]   Make sure that you're building up your own brand.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.420]   Make sure that you are a leader in your industry,
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:03.320]   pushing forward and causing the change in your industry,
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.500]   so that you're not blindsided by it.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.040]   Make sure that you have a side business,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.180]   a side plan, a side hustle, something established
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.700]   that's your backup plan, your baby, that you control.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.200]   If there's something that's applicable to you.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.480]   And then, make sure that you've got
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.300]   those basic financial planning steps in place.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.680]   Having money, having money that's not all subject
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.320]   to the vagaries of the marketplace.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.940]   Having resources, however you define those, set aside.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.640]   Thinking about things in advance,
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.940]   and putting yourself through that mental process
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.140]   of considering them, of considering what's gonna happen.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.800]   Think about that from the economic perspective.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.520]   If you wanna do, like I've been thinking about it,
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.520]   okay, Hurricane Katrina, what would I do?
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.780]   Tsunami, that's, tsunami would be tough to plan for.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.040]   But you can create backup plans.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.400]   What would I do?
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.940]   How could I insulate myself from this?
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.660]   Second and third themes, I just wanna say,
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.680]   look for things that are on sale.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.820]   So right now, with gas prices low, I don't know this.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.700]   I haven't market tested this, but I'm gonna bet you,
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.700]   especially if gas prices persist at a relatively low cost
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.340]   for some months and months, we'll see, I don't know.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.140]   I'm gonna bet you that fuel efficient cars
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.920]   are gonna start to be discounted.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.140]   I remember so clearly, it was a couple years ago
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.260]   when fuel prices were in the four,
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.780]   almost five bucks a gallon, how you could go out
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.820]   and you could buy a one ton pickup truck for nothing.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.180]   You could go out and you could buy a Suburban for nothing.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.540]   That was the time to be buying Suburbans and pickup trucks.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.580]   Well, if gas prices persist over time,
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.820]   it persists to be low, excuse me,
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.220]   if gas prices continue at a low rate,
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.540]   then over time, the value of fuel efficiency
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.420]   will decrease to the general consumer.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.500]   So that's the time that you need to be out of sync.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.820]   You need to think, ah, okay,
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.620]   time to go ahead and buy that Prius.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.220]   Again, gas prices are high.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.460]   Prius, Prii have a high value.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.140]   Gas prices are low, they're discounted.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.980]   So look for that.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.940]   If you need to adjust something,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.740]   if you need to adjust something,
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.500]   think in advance for that.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.380]   And always strive to be a little bit out of step.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.780]   It's kind of tough to know exactly when
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.920]   the stock market is gonna peak,
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.060]   exactly when the stock market is gonna bottom.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.740]   That one's tough.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.140]   But A, you don't have to be completely right on that,
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.620]   but you don't have to be completely right
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.500]   of exactly when gas prices are gonna peak
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.700]   or trough in your own personal life to know,
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.260]   can I get a good deal on a one-ton truck right now
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.940]   if you need a one-ton truck?
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.780]   So just look for that.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.260]   Look for an opportunity to buy and sell
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.000]   with things that are out of whack,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.260]   when prices are out of whack.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.860]   Final theme on the show,
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.820]   I just wanna give you a little bit of a challenge
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:59.980]   and ask you a question.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.700]   Are the low gas prices right now
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.900]   measurably impacting your budget?
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.380]   If they are, you got a problem.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.500]   You're not doing a very good job
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.940]   with your financial planning.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:20.880]   I recognize that there are exceptions.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.500]   I get it.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.800]   But you need to be careful.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.780]   If you are bouncing up and down
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.280]   about the fact that gas prices have decreased
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.160]   from $3 and something to $2 a gallon,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.380]   you're not doing a great job with your financial planning.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.320]   You're really not.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.980]   That means that you've got your priorities.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.500]   Unless you're, at no stage,
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.700]   that means you've got your priorities out of whack.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.660]   Now, enjoy it, sure.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.500]   I like to save money.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.900]   It's enjoyable.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.340]   But I'm not that rich,
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:56.300]   but I haven't really noticed what the gas prices are doing.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:02.700]   And I'm kinda stealing this from an essay I read years ago.
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.540]   I'll go find it and put it in the show notes.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.820]   But Joshua Kennan wrote a brilliant essay on it.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.780]   His point was that you're doing it all wrong
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.620]   if gas prices are affecting your household lifestyle.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.560]   If you're poor, if you don't have a lot of money,
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:20.220]   then you can't afford to be driving.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.360]   You can't afford to have an expensive car.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.780]   You can't afford to have,
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.540]   you can't afford to be driving a ton.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.420]   In that scenario, you should get rid of the driving
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.380]   and solve that problem,
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.980]   rather than trying to wish for low gas prices.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:38.820]   Cars and the ability to consume lots of gas,
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.780]   this is a lifestyle luxury,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.060]   and it should be treated as such.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.300]   I'll go find that essay and I'll put it in the notes.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.960]   But that means, if you're that close to the edge,
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.680]   that means there's no margin in your life.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.460]   That means there's no margin in your finances.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.880]   It's an absolute travesty that the second biggest purchase
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.420]   that most people make in their life is their cars.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.380]   I think everybody oughta drive a nice car
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.620]   after they get rich.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:06.740]   Don't go out and buy fancy cars that consume lots of gas,
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.980]   and don't set up this lifestyle in place
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.600]   where you're driving dozens, I mean hundreds of miles a day.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.860]   If you are driving hundreds of miles per day,
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.480]   hey, thank you, 'cause that means
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.420]   you have a chance to listen to my show.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:25.120]   Make sure you're doing it with a massive payoff.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.220]   Make sure that you're earning a ton of money,
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.420]   or you're getting a huge benefit of some kind for that.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.940]   Because otherwise, you're probably better off
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.980]   to structure your life in such a way
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.680]   that it doesn't require a lot of driving.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.420]   Give some thought.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.580]   I'll go find that essay, but give some thought.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.960]   It's an important thing for you to consider
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.020]   that if these small things, if consumer spending,
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.500]   which is what gasoline is,
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.260]   if this is gonna make a measurable difference
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.780]   in the amount of money that you have every month,
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.940]   you're spending too much money,
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.500]   and you're never gonna be rich.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.820]   That's the key.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.940]   Cars are great, driving is great,
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.380]   but this stuff is a luxury,
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.660]   and you've gotta structure your life in such a way
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:12.140]   that the luxuries are paid for by the wealth.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.940]   If you find yourself in a situation
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.420]   where you're doing anything more than a casual,
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.700]   hey, this is great, I mean, I get that
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.460]   not every Facebook post of a gas sign
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.540]   means that somehow I've got loads of money.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.780]   But if it causes that much of a blip in your lifestyle
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.900]   where it's measurably, you're feeling
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.980]   how much extra money you have because of gasoline,
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.900]   that should be a major red flag for you
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.900]   with your financial plan.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.900]   Now, if it is a red flag, there's hope.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.940]   Fix the problem.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:47.140]   If you're a struggling single parent with multiple kids,
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.140]   and you're not able to save much money,
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.020]   and you're just making just enough money
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.500]   to keep things going, my heart goes out to you.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.940]   I'm not being critical of you as a person.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.020]   Take the savings.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.900]   That can be a major savings.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.660]   Take the savings now and change your lifestyle
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.140]   so that when the next thing happens,
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.500]   when the gas prices go back up,
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.020]   it doesn't destroy your budget.
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.340]   That's the point.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.220]   Think in ahead.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:18.460]   I'm gonna close with a final thought,
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.700]   just with embellishing that thought.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.700]   The gas prices will, in the future, go up to $20 a gallon.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:31.740]   Could your lifestyle sustain that?
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.860]   For most of us, the answer is no.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.380]   But I promise, over time,
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.700]   gas prices will go up to $20 a gallon.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.780]   So think about how you could set up your lifestyle
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.940]   in such a way that that wouldn't affect you,
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.020]   'cause you can make some progress there.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.820]   I hope that was an encouraging show.
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.220]   That was the primary guts of what I just wanted
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.060]   to get across.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.740]   Just wanna get across, think counter-culturally.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.380]   If your Facebook feed looks like mine
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.580]   and you're feeling pretty happy about the future,
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.620]   build on that time for the rest of the time.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.220]   Think in terms of being a farmer.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.900]   The spring is a time to plant,
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.860]   and a lazy farmer who doesn't plant in the spring
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.100]   doesn't reap in the fall.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.940]   Winter feels like it's gonna go forever,
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.780]   but you know what?
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.620]   Spring is coming.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:26.020]   Summer feels great, and you might be tempted
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.060]   to go and run and play all day,
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.300]   but if you don't tend your crops,
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.340]   you're not gonna have the harvest
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.020]   that you need to get you through the winter.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.140]   So enjoy the season of life where you are.
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.420]   Enjoy the low gas prices,
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.900]   but make sure that you're planning for them.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.460]   Enjoy the generally good-feeling economy.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.460]   Seems to be a good feeling.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.980]   Everyone's feeling fairly positive about it.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.860]   But make sure that you're preparing for the next recession.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.220]   Make sure that when the next recession hits,
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.620]   that you are improving your lifestyle
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.460]   so that you'll be able to help somebody else.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.600]   So you'll be able to help your family,
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.920]   help take care of yourself,
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.500]   that your plans won't be thrown off track,
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.740]   but also so that you'll be able to lend a helping hand
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.580]   to some other people who are really struggling and hurting.
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:12.020]   But you gotta lead by example.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.220]   Hope this was useful.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.460]   I wish everybody a phenomenal weekend.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.540]   It's a beautiful day here in Florida.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.380]   I'm done recording.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.020]   It's been a sunshiny, beautiful day.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:24.180]   In the mid-60s, it's been cold today,
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.160]   which is great for us.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.220]   And I'm gonna go and have a lovely evening with my family.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:32.660]   I wish you guys a beautiful weekend and a lovely next week.
