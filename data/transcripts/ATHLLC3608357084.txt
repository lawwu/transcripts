[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.060]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.760]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.280]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.760]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.520]   my journey to optimize my own life by sitting down each week with the world's
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.440]   best experts to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks they use for
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.080]   their own lives and their success.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.720]   Today, I'm talking with Adam Levin, who's an absolute expert on cybersecurity,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.840]   privacy, identity theft, and fraud.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.940]   At 27, he became the youngest director in the history of the New Jersey
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.440]   Division of Consumer Affairs.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.160]   He later went on to found at least two companies, Credit.com, which focused on
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.360]   consumer credit building and was acquired in 2015, and CyberScout, a global
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.000]   identity and data protection company that helped pioneer the cyber insurance
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.320]   business and was acquired in 2021.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   On top of all that, he's the author of the critically acclaimed book, Swiped,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.000]   How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Fishers, and Identity Thieves.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.040]   And he hosts the weekly cybersecurity podcast, What the Hack.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.520]   For many months, I've been wanting to do an episode on everything you need to
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.640]   know about cybersecurity, identity theft.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.920]   So I'm really excited that I got connected with Adam.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.200]   We're going to talk about how to protect yourself from all these threats, what
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.560]   kind of tools and services like VPNs, or security keys, or credit
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.440]   monitoring are actually worth using.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.320]   Basically, I want to leave you with everything you need to
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.200]   know to protect yourself online.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.840]   That is a lot to cover, so let's get started.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.880]   Adam, welcome to the show.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.640]   Chris, thanks so much for inviting me.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   So just to kick us off, I want to know, what do you think is the most
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.880]   common thing you see most people doing wrong when it comes to
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.120]   protecting themselves online?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.000]   Well, I mean, password protocol is terrible with most people.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.520]   Most people pick a easily decipherable, simple password because that's what
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.320]   they can remember, and they use it everywhere.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.640]   And unfortunately, what you have to understand is that even assuming that
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.080]   you had the most indecipherable, sophisticated password possible, if
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.400]   it's been exposed as a result of a leak or a breach, then it's discovered.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.040]   And a discovered password is no good to you anymore.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.000]   And if it's through your entire universe of websites, it's going to
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.720]   come back and be a nightmare for you.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.520]   So you really have to think hard about the kinds of passwords you're going to use.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.920]   In fact, that's why most people use password managers that want to simplify
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.520]   their lives, but you need to do that because one ubiquitous password in your
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.240]   life is guaranteed to create a problem for you.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.960]   Yep.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.240]   Password managers often will tell you this password's been in a breach.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.560]   There was a site that was like, "Have I been pawned?"
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.080]   Is that still like the gold standard of finding out what passwords of
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.640]   yours have been in a breach or what is...
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.360]   It pretty much is.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.160]   Yep.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.240]   "Have I been pawned?"
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.480]   And it's not a happy place by any means.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.200]   And you can also now track your phone number too, because the issue is that
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.240]   for years we've been told that the ultimate skeleton key to your life
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   is your social security number.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.520]   And that's pretty much true.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.280]   But if you think about it now, everybody gives their cell phone
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.960]   number out to everybody.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.320]   And on top of which it's not something, because they're now portable, nobody's
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.960]   going to change their cell phone number.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   So this is a number that's going to stick with you most of your
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.280]   life and it is everywhere.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   So that that's an issue as well.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.320]   What's the risk of your phone number being out there?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.240]   Obviously people can call you, but is it that they could know your number and
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.200]   spoof your number, calling customer service and pretend to be you with
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.440]   automated systems or why is having your number out there as bad or dangerous as
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.920]   maybe your email password, which makes more sense to me why that would be a bad
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.120]   thing.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.840]   Well, the reason why having your number out there is a problem is because if you
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.360]   think about it, most people who use multi-factor authentication, the second
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.760]   factor tends to be a code sent to their phone number.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.400]   If your phone number is stolen as a result of a SIM swap, which is not as
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   difficult as one would think is for a few bucks.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.000]   Unfortunately, people call people at mobile providers and get them to switch
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.960]   things based on the fact that they go, I'm sorry that I forgot my password.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.080]   And this is my phone number and I just got a new device by the way.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.720]   So can you please transfer to my new device?
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.320]   And then all of a sudden you don't get the code.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.720]   We've had cases where people have lost millions in cryptocurrency because the
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.440]   code was sent to the phone number that had been stolen by a hacker.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.200]   Now, I know five, 10 years ago, SIM swapping hit all the news, it was a big
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.480]   thing, is it still happening as much as it was or have the carriers gotten better
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.120]   about requiring more information to switch a phone number or is it still a
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.960]   really big concern?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.760]   Well, again, if you pay somebody off, it doesn't matter what kind of protocols
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.640]   you have in place.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   The carriers are getting better.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   And of course, now you have the opportunity to use a PIN number as an
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.480]   additional layer of security for someone calling to find out more about your
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.960]   phone.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.360]   The only problem is that a lot of people, just like we tend to use simple
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   passwords, people use codes like 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.600]   So it's not that difficult to guess for some of the bad guys.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.080]   So it sounds like a quick thing everyone needs to do.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.920]   If you're not already using a password manager, go back to basics.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.040]   That's something you should do.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.440]   I think most people here have probably heard me talk about password managers
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.160]   enough to hopefully have gotten on the board with that train, but calling your
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.240]   cell phone carrier and making sure you have that PIN set up.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.520]   I know I called Verizon once and just said, Hey, can you put me in some sort of
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.400]   more secure version of an account that can work with some banks, financial
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.440]   institutions, some don't.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.720]   I also like to change my mother's maiden name and give them a different word or
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.680]   number or any string of characters than an actual mother's maiden name, because
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.600]   that like your phone number is not too difficult to find online.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   Are there any other fundamental basics to protect yourself from SIM swapping
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.480]   that people should be doing?
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   Just be very alert.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.600]   And if all of a sudden you're not getting phone calls or you're not getting texts
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.840]   or something just doesn't feel right, immediately contact your mobile provider.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.880]   But you also brought up an interesting thing too, when you talk about changing
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.080]   your mother's maiden name.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   I always say to people, listen, when you set up security questions and
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.720]   answers, lie like a superhero.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.000]   Clark Kent is not going to tell people he's Superman.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.760]   Bruce Wayne doesn't run around saying, Hey, I'm Batman.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.120]   So if your mother's maiden name is Smith, tell people it's Jones.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.240]   If you went to Ridgefield High School, tell them you went to Southwick.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.920]   The key thing is consistency.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.240]   It's not as if you were doing an interview to get a security
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.080]   clearance for national security.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.400]   All you're trying to do is create something that will be a benchmark.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   So it's not about veracity.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.480]   It's just about consistency.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.000]   Sometimes I just have strings of numbers.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.520]   I use one password and I generate a random string of characters.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.120]   So it's like, what's your favorite book?
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.080]   It might be gobbledygook to me.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.960]   Like it's just a bunch of numbers and symbols and letters, but it certainly
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.320]   isn't something anyone would guess.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.400]   And the same goes for the high school I went to or my dog's name
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   or things that you might actually be able to find out online.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.680]   No, no, listen, that's a great idea.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   As they say, the algorithm.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.400]   So so there's a lot of places we could take this, right?
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.200]   I think identity theft is a big area.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.240]   Cybersecurity is a big area.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.160]   Maybe we start with credit identity.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.120]   You mentioned Social Security number is this protected thing
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.600]   with the Equifax breach.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.880]   In my mind, it's like I'm kind of operating
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.440]   like my Social Security number is out there.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.680]   I feel like for, I don't know, one in three Americans now,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.720]   your Social Security number is out there.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.440]   Is that still as easily accessible such that if someone wants
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.520]   your Social Security number and they try hard enough, they can probably get it?
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.080]   And if so, what do we do?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.920]   Let's face it, not just Equifax.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.320]   We're talking about over the past several years, billions.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.160]   And that's Dr.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.280]   Evil Pinky to the lip be billions, billions of files
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.480]   have been exposed through data leaks, breaches,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.000]   people hitting the wrong key and information getting out there.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.480]   People just giving out their Social Security number.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.080]   I mean, think about every time you go to the doctor's office, the dentist's office.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.560]   What do they have on the form?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.520]   Your Social Security number, which, by the way, you can say, no,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.960]   I'm not giving you my Social Security number.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.080]   They're not going to throw you out because they're either operating
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.800]   with your insurance information
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.680]   or they're going to get a credit card before you ever get out the door.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.320]   So you don't need to give them your Social Security number.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.480]   We need to say, no, we have to have it for insurance purposes.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.760]   No, they don't.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.440]   They really don't.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.760]   There have been stories about people at their children's Little League games.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   They were passing around these sheets and people were filling him out.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.840]   It's like, yeah, let me have your Social Security numbers.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.760]   Well, yeah, sure. Here it is.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.200]   People don't really think about it.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.880]   They kind of toss it out like you were tossing out rose petals.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   I think you have to assume your Social Security number is out there.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.680]   You have to assume most of your information is out there.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.800]   So it's really about something that I developed with my collaborator,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.320]   Beau Friedlander, who's also my co-host on What the Hack with Adam Levin.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   We wrote a book called Swiped.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.520]   How to Protect Yourself in a World Filled with Scammers,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   Fishers and Identity Thieves.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.120]   And we came up with the framework.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.480]   Three M's.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.320]   How do you minimize your risk of exposure, reduce your attackable surface?
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.680]   How do you monitor it so you effectively know that there's a problem
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.040]   and that you have to do something about it?
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.120]   And then how do you manage the damage?
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.040]   So what you're raising right now with the fact that our information is out there
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.360]   is how do you effectively monitor so you know as quickly as possible
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.120]   that you have a problem?
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.840]   Well, one of the things you do is, as we mentioned earlier,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.760]   you go to the site Have I Been Pawned and see whether or not your user ID
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.240]   and password has been exposed in a breach.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.560]   And then looking at the particular breach where it was exposed,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.360]   you're going to know, based on the information that has been provided
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.800]   by the companies that have been compromised,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.840]   how much of your information is out there.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.520]   And that's why monitoring is so important.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.760]   Get your credit report.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.720]   Look at your credit.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   Don't just say, I got my credit report.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.400]   I did my good deed.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.200]   Get it. Review it.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.560]   Be serious about it.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.720]   If something doesn't look right, contact the credit reporting agency.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   You need to be looking for things you didn't do,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.680]   as well as things that you might have done that you forgot you did.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.400]   But review it and make sure that it says what you think it should say.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.320]   And if it has additional dates of birth out there for you
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.960]   or different places where you've never worked or different home addresses,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.080]   these are red flags.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.400]   So get your credit report, monitor your credit scores,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.320]   because if your credit scores take a sudden precipitous drop
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.480]   that you can't explain, then it's either one of three reasons.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.360]   You didn't pay a bill on time.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.320]   Not good. You need to know that you're using too much of your available credit.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.760]   Not so good. You need to know that.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   Or you're a victim of identity theft.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.760]   Really not good. And you need to know that.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.000]   Also sign up for what's called transactional monitoring alerts.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.760]   This is from your financial institutions, your credit card companies.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.960]   It's free and it notifies you any time there's any activity in your account.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.640]   And if you see activities going on that do not look familiar,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.600]   then you have to notify your financial institution or the credit card
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.680]   company immediately. But that's one of those red flags.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.160]   Also, believe it or not, look at your explanation of benefits
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.040]   statements that you receive from your health insurance company,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.960]   because a lot of people have discovered that they were victims
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.880]   of medical identity theft because there was a treatment on there
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.640]   or an appointment on there that they never had with a doctor
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.440]   they've never heard of.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.360]   So look at that to make sure it was you.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.400]   And then finally, there are much more sophisticated forms of monitoring
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.520]   that come from the three credit reporting agencies,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.680]   as well as third party providers where they have a number of different things
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.720]   that they're monitoring.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.240]   You need them to be monitoring your Social Security number
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.640]   and your most personal information.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.160]   And then you need to get things like what's called instant alerts,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.640]   which is not, hey, Chris, a few weeks ago,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.280]   somebody using your information to open an account.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.160]   But it's, hey, Chris, somebody is attempting to open an account right now.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.120]   Is it you? Yes or no.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.840]   And then you need to have monitoring that monitors the dark web,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.280]   because if it shows up, that your information is out there
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.000]   and it will tell you what information has been discovered on the dark web,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.720]   whether it's an email address, a password,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.640]   a phone number, account information.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.280]   That's why it's important to do that.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.360]   So the second M, very important.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.160]   So just to recap, so I know getting your credit report,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   free annual credit report dot com, you can get it for free.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.080]   Yes, you do.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.680]   I believe even right now, as a result of maybe the pandemic,
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.080]   you can get it more regularly than once a year.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.680]   You were getting it in some cases either once a month or once a week,
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.800]   depending upon the credit reporting agency.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.520]   And then a lot of the alerts you talked about are free.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.160]   I have an account with Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.480]   I get alerts. I don't pay for any of those premium services.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.720]   I get my credit score.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.840]   Gosh, I probably have five different ways to get it for free,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.800]   whether it's Credit Karma, which isn't necessarily your FICO score,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.040]   but it is a score or different credit card companies.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.000]   Amex gives you a free credit score.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.480]   I think Capital One gives you a free credit score.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.320]   Are there any of the credit monitoring and reporting services
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.680]   that you actually should pay for, or are they a little bit
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.920]   fluffy products that people create for people who are worried?
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.960]   But you can kind of do all this on your own.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.880]   I know you can freeze and lock your credit, which I do for free also.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.360]   Yes. No, you can do that.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.520]   That's as a result of an amendment to a banking law
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.560]   that was done a few years ago.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.760]   But there are services that are worth it
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.200]   because you really need them to take in-depth dives.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.320]   Whereas with free credit reports, you can get them
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.200]   frequently, although a little less frequently now.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.680]   The important thing is you really need to keep up to date.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   And with that payment, you're not just paying for the monitoring,
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.920]   but you're also getting access to a professional
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.040]   that can help you through identity incidents.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   And that's really the third M is that how do you manage the damage?
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.800]   Now, a lot of people don't realize that through their insurance companies,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.400]   some financial institutions, and now more and more through their employers,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.280]   there are programs available to help you through identity incidents.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.560]   In some cases, it's free as a perk of your relationship with the institution.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.240]   In some cases, it's deeply discounted.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.880]   In some cases, it may not be.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.600]   But you have to really think about how important it is to know
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.200]   whether or not you've got a problem and have somebody
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   who can help you through the problem.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.360]   I get that if you are involved in an incident, it can be helpful
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.960]   to have an expert kind of manage the entire process.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.560]   But for just monitoring, would you say everyone needs to be using
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.800]   a premium service or how do you kind of set the threshold for someone thinking,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.080]   can I feel like I've got monitors?
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.240]   I get my alerts, I get my transaction alerts.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.080]   I check my credit every so often when my score changes, I get an alert.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.880]   Does the average person in that circumstance who hasn't yet been a victim
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.440]   of any fraud or theft need the premium services?
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.760]   Well, it depends how premium you want to go.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.040]   And you have opportunities to select amongst those premium services.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.720]   And even then, the level of premium service you wish to get.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.760]   And it really has to do with your comfort level
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.000]   and how alert you are and how informed
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.480]   you think you are based on the alerts you're seeing.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.600]   And the truth is, access to a professional
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.960]   to help you through incidents is priceless.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.760]   It really is.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.600]   And if you talk to a lot of the folks who have been on both sides
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.920]   of the cyber world, they will all tell you that so much information
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.680]   is out there about us right now, that the fact that each and every one of us
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.600]   hasn't become a victim of some form of identity theft
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.480]   is simply because they haven't gotten around to us yet.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.600]   It's really a question of supply and demand.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.640]   But I can tell you, having owned a company, well, first a company
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.960]   that was involved in monitoring and then a company that was involved
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.200]   in managing damage and taking care of people.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   It really depends on what you want to get out of it,
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.320]   how much you're willing to invest.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.880]   It's not a criminally expensive amount
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.400]   if you get the more moderately priced monitoring programs.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.200]   And you really need to know and you need to know as quickly as possible.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.600]   And you have to pay attention.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.000]   I imagine if I Google credit monitoring services, there's thousands.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.760]   I imagine some are much worse
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.040]   and probably just repackaging what you can get for free for a fee. Right.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.640]   Are there particular companies or services that you think
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.480]   are actually providing that added value for their fees?
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.440]   There are. I generally don't single out anybody specifically.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.760]   And it's not because I'm being paid by anybody in particular.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.560]   It's just I really feel like it's a function of
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.520]   you really need to do your research.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   Now, the Consumer Federation of America has a website.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.640]   I think it's called ID Theft Info.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.000]   I could be wrong, but it's just like a Consumer Federation of America.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.280]   They actually have the majority of the major players
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.680]   in the identity monitoring service world.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.960]   They signed up for best practices.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.640]   And what they do at that website is they give you a list of questions
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.080]   and answers to think about when you're searching for someone
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.120]   to monitor your credit or to actually help you through a credit incident.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.440]   And it's really worth it to go to that website.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.840]   But there are a number of very good companies that have very good
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.000]   and thorough monitoring programs.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.960]   But as with anything, take time and do your research.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.160]   I was hoping I could skip a little of the research and get the answers from you.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.680]   Are there any companies, you know, in the space that's like
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.200]   definitely avoid like companies that are on your blacklist
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.440]   of credit monitoring and identity theft protection?
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.080]   Are there services where you're like, no, I just skip over lifelock?
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.280]   They're the worst or something.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.040]   Anyone in the space to avoid?
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.920]   Well, no, see, now you're getting me to actually recommend certain companies.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.240]   I don't. First of all, OK, I'll give you some.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.320]   Or is one that's very good.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.440]   Lifelock is very good.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.200]   I can tell you for years I've used the Experian
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.360]   and Protect My ID, their program, that's very good.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.560]   My old company, Credit.com, we had a number of products and services
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.320]   that we matched people with that were very good.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.520]   And I'm sure the folks at Credit Karma and other places
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.200]   can also give you recommendations.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.800]   Another place to go just for just great advice
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.520]   in general is the Identity Theft Resource Center.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.320]   They're out of San Diego.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.400]   Eva Velasquez is the CEO.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.280]   She's been CEO for a while.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.720]   They're highly respected.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.680]   And and for those people who who don't use paying services
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.280]   and are in trouble and need help and are victims of identity incidents,
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.800]   they actually work with some of the bigger companies
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.160]   and have a deal going on where these companies will help them
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.320]   help people for free.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.120]   So the Identity Theft Resource Center, ITRC, OK, is is very good.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.720]   Thanks for giving some information that I know you didn't want to.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.760]   Yeah, science has shown that being charitable
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.520]   can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.600]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.680]   They're a not for profit community built around a new modern way to give,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.400]   and they have a mission I think we can all get behind,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.280]   helping people be more generous more often.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.440]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving because they offer an account
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.080]   that makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.720]   You can make a one time contribution or you can set a little aside
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.800]   each week or month, and all your contributions are tax deductible,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.800]   except you don't actually have to know exactly
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.880]   where you want to give the money right away.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.160]   In fact, you can make your tax deductible contribution now
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.360]   and invest that money into stocks or even crypto
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.360]   so it can grow tax free and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.320]   Then whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.400]   one and a half million charities, schools or faith based organizations
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.240]   in a matter of seconds.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.600]   So head on over to all the hacks dot com slash Daffy
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.040]   if you want to start giving today and for a limited time.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.480]   If you visit that link, you can get a free twenty five dollars
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.760]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:02.280]   Again, that's all the hacks dot com slash Daffy.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.200]   In today's Internet age, people's personal information
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.160]   is being shared online with the click of a button without their consent,
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.240]   and it happens all the time.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.720]   But you can tackle this problem thanks to Delete Me from Abine,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.640]   the company Adam just mentioned.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.400]   And I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.800]   When I used to Google myself, I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.240]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email, family members and a lot more.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.080]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself, which you can do.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.240]   But after at least 10 hours, I signed up for Delete Me.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.080]   And it was so much easier.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.640]   Their software and team of experts will not just find and remove
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.040]   your personal information from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.880]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.080]   and get that removed as well.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.280]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes over 2000 pieces of data
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.400]   for a customer in their first two years.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.160]   So if you want to get your personal information removed from search results
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.240]   on the Web, go to all the hacks dot com slash Delete Me
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.040]   and get 20 percent off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.360]   Again, that's all the hacks dot com slash Delete Me with credit cards.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.240]   I think a lot of the reason people are not too worried
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.200]   about just putting their credit card number online is that most,
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.360]   if not all credit card companies nowadays take the burden
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.920]   of the risk of something happening and fraudulent charges.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.040]   But one thing I don't think I know, so I'm assuming most people don't.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.840]   If someone uses your Social Security number to open a bank account
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.440]   or take out a mortgage or a loan or buy a car,
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.400]   how much of the liability ends up falling on you?
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.520]   Is the risk all the hassle of cleaning it up?
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.480]   Or is there actually risk that you could be liable for what happens
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.760]   and someone else won't pick up the tab like they might with credit card fraud?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.920]   Well, we've seen, for instance, situations where people have had
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.080]   their Social Security numbers used to take mortgages out on their homes.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.760]   That becomes problematic because you really need attorneys for that.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.280]   And it's not a simple process to have
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.160]   a mortgage removed from your home when the money was actually taken
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.720]   using your information.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.800]   Now, your insurance company can be very helpful there.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.000]   Check with your insurance company and find out if they have identity
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.080]   protection programs, if it's automatic or you need to bring it on
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.520]   as an endorsement to your insurance policy.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.160]   Oftentimes your homeowner's policy, your renter's policy.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   Now even they're offering identity theft services through auto owner policies.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.960]   But you may need that insurance coverage for that that you may pay for.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.200]   But it's not a large sum of money.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.440]   It's just generally a fee for an endorsement.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.560]   But no, it can be a problem.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.160]   We've seen cases, for instance, with Zelle.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.040]   Now, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just came out and kind of dropped
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.240]   the hammer on a number of those peer to peer payment apps
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.320]   because so many people have had their information stolen, the app used
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.640]   or they in good faith used it because they thought they were dealing
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.200]   with somebody real and not an identity thief or a hacker or a scammer.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.760]   And the money's gone.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.560]   And of course, they do tell you before you hit that button,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   make sure you know who you're dealing with.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.080]   But that's changing.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.280]   Let me take you back to sort of the beginning of identity theft.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.080]   And in the early days of dealing with identity theft issues
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.400]   and even to a little bit today,
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.560]   the victim was guilty until proven innocent.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.760]   And in fact, the consumer was considered collateral damage.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.800]   It was viewed as the business was the victim
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.760]   of the identity theft or the fraud.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.960]   Now, with credit cards, you're right. Banks.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   It used to be $50 liability.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.320]   It's now down in most cases to zero debit cards.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.040]   Little different story.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.240]   Many of them have good protections.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.600]   But in some cases, the financial institution will say that
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.000]   before we return your money to you, we have to do an investigation
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.200]   and we have to feel comfortable that you didn't just do something dumb
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.840]   and you're trying to get us to cover your loss.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.520]   Fortunately, most people listening here are a big fan
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.480]   of earning credit card points and aren't using their debit card much.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.440]   But the identity theft, I'd love to go back to the beginning.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.480]   You were the victim. How has that evolved?
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.080]   Well, it's evolved now that there is a greater understanding of the fact
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.880]   that millions upon millions of people have become victims of identity theft.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.120]   And in many cases, through no fault of their own, simply
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.600]   their information was on the wrong database at the wrong moment
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.800]   and the wrong person gained access.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.280]   And now suddenly they're victims of identity theft.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.920]   And you have so many different levels of identity theft.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.680]   You have the low hanging fruit, which is account takeover,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.440]   which has to do with credit cards and debit cards.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.040]   Raise up the food chain a little bit.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.320]   Then you have new account identity theft.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.040]   That's where someone using your information has gone about the countryside,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.640]   happily opening accounts in your name with your information,
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.400]   running up the balances and then disappearing into the sunset.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.640]   And then you get other forms of identity theft, like medical identity theft,
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.160]   where someone using your information gets medical treatment in your name,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.960]   has a procedure in your name, has appointments in your name.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.040]   In most cases, it's a fraud against the insurance company,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   but it could come back to haunt you depending upon your lifetime allowances.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.560]   But in cases where insurance wasn't involved,
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.120]   you've had many situations where people get a bill
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.880]   that comes out of nowhere from a medical provider.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.480]   And it's huge.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.760]   And they end up having problems with their credit reports
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.000]   and fighting with the medical provider and being sued.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.480]   And there is a greater understanding of that now.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.120]   There's child related identity theft.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.320]   Kids have no idea because they don't check their credit.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.560]   They don't even think they have a credit report.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.760]   Most parents don't check their kid's credit reports, although that's changing.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.720]   But in that case, we had one guest on What the Hack.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.360]   Axon Betts Hamilton has become a very famous expert on identity theft
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.840]   where she was a victim and her mother was the thief.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.720]   Her mother stole her identity, her father's identity.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.000]   Her grandfather's identity had a second life.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.000]   And as Axton said, I spent Thanksgiving sitting across the table
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.920]   for 19 years across from my identity thief.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.160]   And there are a not insignificant number
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.080]   of identity theft victims where it occurs within the family.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.800]   Foster children, for example, 10% are victims of identity theft,
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.320]   because as they go through the foster system, they have a card
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.200]   with their information that's passed from family to family to family.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.320]   And in many cases, that information is used to steal their identity.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.720]   So you have that.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   And now the government's gotten involved and try to be more helpful
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.160]   in situations like that.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.520]   The reporting agencies are much more understanding when it comes to this.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.200]   But there is a process that you go through.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.440]   And if you do it, it could take months,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   hours of your life.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.720]   You could end up with no life and no job and no family
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.960]   because you're spending so much time focusing on resolving
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.520]   your identity theft issue.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.400]   For instance, if you become a victim of criminal identity theft,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.200]   that's a big problem.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.640]   That's where someone using your information commits a crime.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.880]   There was a movie Identity Thief that you may have seen,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.160]   but they commit a crime.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.400]   We had a case once a fellow was driving through the Midwest.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.800]   He gets pulled over for a busted taillight.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.280]   All of a sudden, his car is surrounded by guys with guns.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.880]   They make him get on the ground.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.600]   They cuff him in front of his kids.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.160]   They take him to jail and he gets out in a couple of days.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.520]   But he needs to get a lawyer.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.960]   And sometimes it takes a not insignificant amount of time
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.640]   to clear your name if you're a victim of criminal identity theft.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.640]   Is there a way that he could have prevented that?
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.800]   Obviously, committing a crime isn't something
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.840]   that's necessarily going to show up on your credit report.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.640]   I know every time you apply for a job, they run a background check.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.440]   Is there like a background check
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.080]   monitoring service to see if things like that are happening?
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.840]   There are some of the services now that will monitor
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.360]   as part of their overall monitoring,
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.520]   whether you've had incidents of a criminal nature
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.400]   or at least there are warrants out there for you and you might not know about.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.080]   But criminal identity theft is something that you can almost do
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.440]   absolutely nothing about.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.040]   It's just someone did it, used your information, committed the crime.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.000]   How do you prove you didn't commit a crime, right?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.040]   That's a little more difficult than someone nailing you for committing a crime.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.680]   It becomes more complicated.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.960]   That's why it's so important for people to be alert.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.160]   If you get a notification about something, don't assume
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.040]   if you know nothing about it, that it's a mistake.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.360]   At the same point, don't immediately jump
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.480]   and try to do something about it, because it could be somebody committing
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.360]   a fraudulent act and getting you to click on the wrong link
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.280]   or open the wrong attachment as well.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.000]   I want to come back to a few things, but when you get that link,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.880]   when you get that email, I think it's wild to me how many different examples
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.640]   I've seen recently of successfully convincing people that this is the right
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.920]   link, whether it's using some weird font that isn't actually the right font.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.000]   I've seen one where someone had the domain registered
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.280]   that was like mail.google.com.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.520]   So it looks in a small window like it's correct, but then it's mail.google.com
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.280]   dot some other address, dot some other address.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.680]   And so it actually looks like the right prefix, but it's not.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.720]   I always say, of course, look at the full URL, look at the full sender.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.840]   Are there other things in those moments that people could quickly do
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.520]   just to make sure or validate that it's correct?
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.440]   Well, if you get a notification from what appears to be
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.760]   an organization of authority, first, you have to think about it.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.960]   First, the IRS doesn't email anybody.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.360]   Police departments wouldn't normally send you an email and go, Hey, by the way,
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.640]   we think you've committed a crime to notify us here.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.120]   What you should do, even if you get one that looks really, really official,
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.880]   contact the specific agency
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.600]   and independently confirm the contact information
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.760]   and then reach out to them and say, I got the strangest thing.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.320]   Did you send me something?
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.920]   Now, most people don't like to red flag themselves with the IRS.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.440]   But at the same point, you need to make sure that you're dealing with the IRS.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.000]   And of course, generally, the only way they deal with you
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.680]   initially is you get a letter, maybe not a letter you want to receive,
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.880]   but you will get a letter.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.440]   They don't call you unless you owe them money.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.880]   You've owed the money for a very long time.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.520]   They've sent you notice after notice, after notice.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.360]   You didn't respond.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.040]   And then you might might get a call from a legitimate debt collector.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.520]   There are about three or four that have been designated by the IRS.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.120]   But again, generally, it's never something
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.160]   where you're asked to do something urgently.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:24.360]   You never get something in the eyes of saying, unless you pass right now,
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.720]   we're sending someone to arrest you or even a phone call.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.560]   They don't do that.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.440]   You're always offered an opportunity to have a conversation with an agent
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.800]   and reach a settlement agreement with the IRS, for example.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.000]   But that's what scams are based on.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.480]   And a lot of the scams are very similar.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.000]   Think of it as the music is the same, but the lyrics change
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.520]   depending upon what's happening in the world
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.560]   or what the scammer or the hacker is trying to achieve.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:58.000]   So you really need to set a list of protocols for yourself
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.880]   as to what you do and protocol number one.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.720]   Stop. Read it carefully.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.600]   Calm down.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.040]   Think about what it's saying and think about whether or not it's logical
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.640]   that you would have received this communication by way of an email
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.760]   and whether or not what they're asking you to do seems logical
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.040]   within the time frame they're giving you to respond.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.840]   That's great advice.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.880]   Are there any new tactics?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.960]   I know SIM swapping made all the news years ago.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.560]   Is there anything happening right now that you know about
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.920]   because you're in the industry that maybe other people will hear about
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.560]   over the next few years, but would be good to know now?
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.760]   Well, let's go through some of the scams that exist and sort of match them
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.120]   to what's going on.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.880]   First of all, their health care scams that have been going on for forever.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.520]   But in particular, COVID was a petri dish for them.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.000]   And now monkeypox is becoming a problem as well.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.400]   And that could be anything from updates
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.200]   to tracking to notifications
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.880]   to here's where you get your vaccine.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.600]   Here's where your schedule, your test, these kinds of things.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.760]   So you have to be on the lookout for this.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.160]   Again, as you said, run your cursor over the email address
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.480]   to make sure that where it's coming from looks legitimate.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.600]   And even then, wherever it's coming from,
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.160]   even if it's a phone calls from someone saying they're from the health department,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.880]   thank them, hang up, independently confirm the right number
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.760]   for your county health department or your state health department or even the CDC.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.400]   If you think you're getting a call from the CDC,
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.760]   which I really haven't heard of too many calls coming from the CDC,
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.280]   then then call the real number and speak to somebody
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.960]   and confirm whatever that information that they're providing you.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:57.200]   And remember, in most of these cases, they are never supposed to ask you
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.040]   what your social security number is or getting credit card information from you.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.440]   You can't pay to get to the head of the line with these.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.560]   If it's a legitimate government situation and it's involving health care,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.560]   there is a protocol to use and in no protocol that I know of
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.320]   and have ever known of, are you paying something in advance
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.720]   in order to advance your prospects with that?
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:26.240]   So you have job scams all the time, especially during the Great Resignation.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.840]   And now with inflation and now with the concerns about whether or not
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.320]   there's going to be a recession, people may be looking for additional jobs.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.280]   There go to legitimate, well-vetted websites
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.520]   and make sure that you're communicating with the right organization.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.040]   If someone asks you to provide your social security number right off the bat,
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.240]   that's not legitimate.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.320]   Don't walk, run.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.040]   So this could be a job board.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   You see a job you're interested in.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.600]   You're like, oh, this company is interesting.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.160]   Maybe I should apply for it.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.400]   It could just be a totally a fake company that's leading you down a path
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.360]   of interviewing for a job with the purpose of just collecting information about you.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.000]   Is that absolutely or getting financial information
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.960]   by way of you giving them your credit card information?
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.600]   Let's say it's a secret shopper job.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.120]   And they say, well, you know, to get you started,
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.360]   we're going to be laying out some money, but we'd like you to reimburse us for this.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.080]   So be careful.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.360]   You don't want to get involved in anything like that
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.480]   unless you can confirm the legitimacy of it.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.960]   So always independently confirm.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.600]   Also confirm that particular company is actually looking to hire people
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.000]   by going to the real website of the organization
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.760]   and then calling the HR department of the company
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.080]   and asking them if they're conducting interviews.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.680]   But you have to be very careful about job scams.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.760]   There was a scam that was going around for a while, disappeared,
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.880]   came back again, the jury commission scam.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.280]   That's where you get a phone call.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.520]   Someone represents themselves to be from the jury commission.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.960]   They're polling, quote, eligible jurors in the district.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.800]   And if you would be so kind as to provide them with your social security number,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.680]   they will be able to let you know whether or not you're eligible
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.080]   or not for the jury poll.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.920]   There have been scams where police departments were supposedly calling people
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.480]   and asking them for specific information.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.640]   Generally, police departments just don't call people out of the blue.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.800]   Or if they do, it's a legitimate detective.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.600]   They may be asking you questions,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.440]   but they're not going to be asking for your social security number,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.840]   your date of birth or things like that.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.680]   Unemployment scams, of course, have been a disaster during covid.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.400]   Billions upon billions of dollars have been stolen.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.280]   My own sister in law, who was on one of our episodes,
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.960]   was talking about the fact that she was legitimately notified
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.840]   by her home state of Colorado and by the state of Ohio
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.280]   that somebody using her information had applied for unemployment benefits.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.360]   In one case, she found out simply because she received
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.160]   a debit card in the mail from the unemployment agency,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.480]   which she said, I'm not looking for a job.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.440]   I'm fine. I'm not out of work.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   We've had cases where people found out because someone in their company
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.680]   walked up to their desk in the days when people were actually at their desk
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.240]   and said, by the way, why did you apply for unemployment?
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.760]   You still have a job here.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.120]   That was going on.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.520]   You have the tech scams.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.640]   That's what you get a phone call from someone representing themselves
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.600]   to be from Apple or Microsoft, saying that they've noticed
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.680]   that there's a problem with your computer.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.720]   They are going to direct you to a site where you can download certain software,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.200]   which will enable them to then come into your computer and check it out
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.960]   and solve whatever the problem is.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.320]   Apple and Microsoft, they don't do that.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.920]   But scammers certainly do that.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.560]   Be on the lookout for tech scams.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.520]   Then, of course, in the line of work that you've been talking about, too,
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.640]   which is vacations and points and all of that.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.440]   There have been theft of frequent fire miles.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.120]   There have been all kinds of vacations, all kinds of rental scams
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.200]   that people have to be on the lookout for, which we can go into further depth
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.560]   if you'd like to do that.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.360]   And then there's catfishing, which is huge.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.920]   Whatever the theme may be, it's still a catfish.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.760]   And what people are trying to do is they're trying to tug on your heartstrings
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.520]   and get you to believe that they care about you.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.960]   And the whole goal is to get into your life as quickly as possible
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.280]   and as authentically as possible.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.560]   But yet you never really get to see them.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.400]   You never get to really hear them.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.080]   You may just be communicating with them by text or by email.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   And then at some point, relatively quickly into this relationship,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.880]   you're suddenly asked for a lot of personal information
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:53.080]   or they send you a compromising picture and ask you to reciprocate.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.680]   And what you don't realize, that's not their picture,
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.640]   but unfortunately, that's your picture you just sent to them.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.760]   And suddenly you can become a victim of extortion and blackmail.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.000]   Or they ask you to provide credit card information so that you can help them
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.520]   get a plane ticket to come visit you.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.920]   Or we've had cases.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.400]   We had a woman on our show talking about the fact that she met someone online
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.480]   who even had a terrific LinkedIn profile as a very successful
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.760]   medical professional who had decided to dedicate part of his life
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.920]   to go to the Mideast and open a clinic there.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.640]   And somewhere in the first couple of weeks that they were getting to know
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.840]   each other, he said, our equipment has come in.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.160]   It's held up by customs at the airport.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.440]   If there's any way that you could help me by sending me 30,000
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.840]   so I can get the equipment out, that would be great.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.840]   Of course, she didn't do it.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.920]   She wouldn't fall for it.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.520]   But unfortunately, a lot of people do.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:56.040]   I mean, we've seen cases where someone was taken to the tune of two million
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.040]   dollars by someone who convinced them that he loved him.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.200]   And the only way that they found out there was something wrong,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.920]   which they should have known from the beginning, was that a financial advisor
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.560]   notified members of their family and said, something's going on with your mom.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.320]   She's taking a lot of money out and sending it overseas.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.080]   You really need to look into this.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.240]   And even after confronted with the reality of her situation, she said, OK,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.000]   I understand it's a fraud, but in my heart, I still love it. Wow.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.120]   I mean, this is how deeply they ingrain themselves into your life.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.960]   And then another scam are charity scams.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.600]   And this is where they'll take the issue of the day,
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.720]   whether it's the Ukraine, it's a natural disaster.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.400]   It's a crisis somewhere in the world.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.240]   It's children.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.400]   Any one of those topics, whatever is in the news, they will use it.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.600]   They will convince you that they are the newest, best, most successful,
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.640]   most respected organization in the space.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.400]   And could you please give them credit card information or send money to this?
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.840]   And it's not real. It's a fraud.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.920]   That's really interesting.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.840]   So I've been a little familiar with some, not all the others.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.960]   When it comes to the frequent flyer miles thing, if you Google my name,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.240]   there's some articles about having a lot of points in miles.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.520]   And so I have been a victim of theft of points, I guess,
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.840]   which we talked about maybe coming on your show.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.920]   And if that happens, definitely go check it out.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.280]   I'll tell the full story.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.720]   But in short, that's what sent me down a path of really locking down
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.920]   all these accounts, because someone was able to call Chase
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.880]   and get Chase to let them order things with points on the Internet.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.840]   The craziest thing, and I'm still today don't understand it,
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:48.920]   was they ordered an Apple laptop using my points, but they shipped it to my house.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.120]   Now, maybe the plan was to come to my house and pick it up, but they never did.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.840]   Just an Apple laptop showed up.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.280]   So it was like the strangest fraud because Chase refunded the points.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.080]   And I had a laptop.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.600]   I asked Chase what they wanted me to do with it.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.560]   And they said, try to take it to the Apple store.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.880]   The Apple store didn't want it.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.080]   So eventually Chase said, the best thing we can tell you is to keep it or donate it.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.960]   We don't know what to do.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.840]   It ended up being a happy story for me,
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.160]   but it was probably payback for the hours of time to mitigate it.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.040]   I want to go back to your first M, which is about minimizing the risk.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.600]   Yes, yes.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.520]   And talk about some of the things people can be doing
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.520]   to prepare and kind of plan in advance of any of this happening.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.240]   And there's a couple areas here I'll go to.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.680]   But one is around information online.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   So I remember back when I was a venture capitalist, this company, Fortalis,
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.440]   which I know you're familiar with, was raising money
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.160]   and they offered to run some reports on people in the investing group
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.840]   to show off their product.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.000]   And they ran this report.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.480]   And I was like, wow, it's not that I didn't know
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.320]   there was information about me online, right?
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.880]   There's family tree websites.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.320]   There's white page websites.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.800]   There's my social media.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.080]   When someone pulls all of that information together into one place
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.360]   and you see a list of every address you've ever lived at, every job
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.240]   you've had, all of your phone numbers, all of your email addresses.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.560]   And then the exact same set of information for your spouse,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.440]   your siblings, your parents, and they put it all together.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.400]   You're just a little bit taken aback.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.680]   And it made me think, gosh, should I be getting rid of this?
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.760]   Is there a way that consumers can get a lot of this information off the Internet
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.800]   or what goes into trying to mitigate this risk and minimize the risk
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.000]   in getting stuff taken away?
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.160]   Well, I could give you my favorite George Carlin line, which it's a mystery.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.720]   But the truth is that there are things that can be done.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.840]   That is a long and arduous and time consuming process
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   because you literally have to go from data broker to data broker.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.040]   And there are procedures you can use.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.520]   And each one explains it to you.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.480]   And of course, the CFPB, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.960]   has advice on exactly how to do all of that.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.320]   But just like when LifeLock started and someone said,
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.160]   wasn't it true that a lot of this stuff people can do themselves?
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.640]   And the answer, which I thought was a very interesting answer,
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.040]   and I've been a fan of LifeLock, is they said, well, sure,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.040]   you can also change your own oil.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.000]   And if you want, you could maybe even change your own muffler.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.200]   Do you want to?
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.640]   So it really has to do with how much time you're willing to dedicate to it.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.960]   Some people, it's a crusade and they will do it
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.480]   because they don't want to pay anyone else to do it and they will do it.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.200]   Others will find companies like Reputation.com,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.360]   which is where they will work to get negative information about you offline,
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.600]   or companies like ABINE, where they will work with you
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.240]   to actually delete information from the online world.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.040]   And now that there is a right to forget in the GDPR,
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.200]   which is the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.920]   and it's incorporated to some extent
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.040]   in the California Consumer Protection Act,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.120]   and it is hoped that maybe it will be also
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.760]   incorporated in the American Data Protection Act,
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.200]   which is kind of wending its way through Congress,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.640]   assuming it can actually find its way through Congress,
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.040]   which is very difficult for us.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.560]   As we've seen in the past, it's very difficult for stuff
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.160]   to get through Congress, all the interests involved.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.800]   But it still is a process.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.160]   Now, you can contact Google, for instance,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.720]   and ask them to remove certain information about you,
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.880]   which they're willing to do.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.000]   But it's a process.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.160]   This is just like with a credit report,
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.040]   when people would go to credit repair companies
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.440]   and some of them are good and some of them are really, really not good.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.600]   And they would say, OK, we will get this information off.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.920]   And they do.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.080]   But unfortunately, it was legitimate information.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.960]   And as a result, when the particular subscribing retailer
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.200]   does an update, the information finds itself back
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.680]   onto your credit report again.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.840]   Think of all of the millions of websites that are out there
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.640]   and how, unfortunately, over the years,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.720]   there's been this wholesale sharing of information
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.160]   or selling information or lending information,
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.000]   depending upon what the relationship was between these organizations.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.240]   And it's going to be out there.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.960]   And can you get it off?
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.120]   Maybe for a period of time.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.360]   Can you get it everywhere?
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.920]   It may take you forever to find out where everywhere is.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.680]   And there's a new part of everywhere that shows up every day.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.640]   So that's why you have to say to yourself, look, the world I live in,
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.320]   it's a surveillance economy.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.920]   It just is.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.960]   We are surrounded by billions of Internet of Things devices,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.600]   tracking, listening, sending data back to manufacturers,
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.480]   data then being shared, that information also being hacked by hackers.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:01.520]   So that's why you need to really consider the three M's.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:07.040]   And among the things you should be doing, assuming that your data is out there,
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.360]   even despite your best efforts to get it off the online world,
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.000]   is everything from long and strong passwords
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.800]   not shared among websites or password managers using two factor
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:26.120]   authentication, which makes it, again, more difficult for someone to represent
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:30.360]   that they are you because they do have to go through that extra layer
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.880]   of whether a code is sent to a cell phone or you use thumbprints,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.600]   eye scans, depending upon the particular device you're using.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.720]   I'm a particular fan of thumbprints.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.640]   They also multi-factor authentication can involve voice prints.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.120]   Of course, the issue is what if, God forbid, someone steals a database
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.840]   of a company where they have your voice prints?
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.920]   That could be a problem, too.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.880]   But again, any layer of additional authentication you can add is important.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.040]   It also means you don't click on every link you see.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:06.160]   You don't open every attachment, even if you think it's coming from someone,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.760]   you know. I mean, a perfect example.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.800]   It's a buzzkill.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:14.360]   But any time I get an e-card from someone, the first thing I do is I call that person
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.160]   and say, I know this is a buzzkill, but did you just send
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.720]   it? You don't have to tell me what it says.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.240]   I'll go do it, provided you confirm you really did it.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.480]   But again, with the malware that's out there
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.760]   and the ransomware attacks that are going on, you always run the risk
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.320]   that someone receives something that they opened that they thought
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.040]   was hysterically funny and terrific, and they're sending it to you.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.560]   But they didn't realize that it had malware on it.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.040]   And all they've done is they've shared the love and the hack with you.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.520]   You do run that risk.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.600]   That's why it's really important to be very careful where you click, what you open.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.680]   That means, as we talked about earlier, you lie like a superhero
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.200]   when you're sending up questions and answers.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.520]   That means that you freeze your credit, which is, as we talked about, is free.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.360]   And you can do it.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:12.200]   That means that even the humble shredder, and I don't mean a ribbon cut shredder,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.720]   because for those of us who saw Argo as an example,
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.920]   what happens is you can get kids or people hopped up on drugs
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.680]   who will sit there and meticulously tape back up
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.440]   things that have been cut by a ribbon cut shredder.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:32.720]   That's why you need a confetti cut shredder or a cross cut shredder,
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:37.520]   which turns this into little useless pieces of confetti
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.000]   that no one can put back together again.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.720]   These are some of the things that you need to think about doing.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   Or, as we also talked about earlier,
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.240]   that's where the third M comes in, and it's so important.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:55.520]   And that is to contact your insurance agent, your financial services rep
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.320]   or the H.R. department where you work and say,
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.400]   if I become a victim of an identity incident or if I'm worried about it
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.280]   or I find out that an organization that I've had a relationship with has been hacked,
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.200]   are you going to help me through the incident?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.280]   Yeah. And that's where it's really important.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.080]   And a lot of these programs are free,
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.320]   deeply discounted and worth you signing up for.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.720]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.240]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.000]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.080]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.040]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.480]   the go to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.560]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.640]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.800]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.280]   Or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.960]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do list,
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.000]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.040]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.080]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.000]   on their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.400]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.680]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.040]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly.com.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.960]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.320]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.600]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.440]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:44.160]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts from our partners,
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.400]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.840]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.920]   I'll share a couple others that I've learned in the past.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.960]   I don't know how many years.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.920]   Some I've employed, some I plan to.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.000]   I actually have multiple email addresses.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.840]   So I have an email address that I just use for financial institutions.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.400]   Good idea.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.280]   I have never shared that email with anyone.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.080]   Only financial institutions know it.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.360]   I've been recommended, though
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.600]   I haven't, to use a separate one for social media profiles.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.800]   Just yes, that was another recommendation is to just have different email addresses.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.200]   Look, if you don't have a password manager, I can only imagine how hard that is.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.720]   So we're going to go back to your original recommendation,
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.520]   which is everyone needs a password manager.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.160]   Everyone should be using two factor authentication everywhere they can.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.400]   I personally prefer and switch all of it
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.320]   as much as possible to be a one time password.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.440]   Oh, yeah, one time.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.800]   Well, yeah, and you can use Google Authenticator.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.720]   You can use some of the more the hardware oriented.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.920]   You know, when we talked earlier, you had mentioned one of them when we talked prior.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.800]   I'm a fan of all of my two factor being one time passwords
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.920]   that you can put in Google Authenticator or Authy or even one password,
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:58.880]   though I had historically been putting all of my one time passwords in one password.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.720]   I am now realizing as convenient as it is for them to copy and paste them.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.960]   The fact that I'm storing my password in the exact same place
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.160]   I'm storing my two factor off inherently makes it no longer two factor
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.000]   because they're in the same place.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.840]   It's like one a factor, you know, two types of single factor.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.600]   So I'll probably actually be changing that.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.800]   Do you have an opinion on using hardware?
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:26.120]   Yubico plug in security keys versus Google Authenticator and Authy app?
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.000]   You know, there are some people that like using security keys,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.920]   but they're generally one account related keys, as I believe.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.640]   Yubico may be more than that, but I think it is one.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.920]   So my Yubico key, I use it with Facebook
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.840]   and with Google and with different services, so I can sign into different services.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.280]   It's a lot more hassle to have to carry this thing around and plug it in.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.560]   Obviously, that comes with security, but it's just one where I'm like,
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   I haven't quite determined that it's worth it.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.880]   Yeah, because that's the issue is that you may carry it with you.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.920]   But then if one day it disappears, it's not helpful to you.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.080]   Just keep in mind, if you're using Google Authenticator, you lose your phone,
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.440]   you lose those passwords.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.960]   Obviously, you can usually recover them with backup codes.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.960]   I definitely recommend writing down those backup codes or using something like Authy,
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.160]   which is a competitor.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.280]   But I know they actually store those so you can transfer them between devices.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.000]   There might be better services.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.440]   By the way, if anyone listening here has any recommendations
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.840]   that we didn't cover or anything, please send them to me,
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.080]   because hopefully between now and the time this airs,
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.040]   I'm going to try to put a lot of these into place,
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.840]   test a lot of these services out and maybe release another little bonus episode
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.400]   with my feedback from trying to do all of this.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.960]   That would be great.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.000]   Just remember, whenever you write down something, put it in some place secure.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.960]   You always run the risk if you use a Post-it on your computer
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.240]   and someone breaks in your house, you've just given away another key to the kingdom.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.080]   So another tip someone gave me is actually not just
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.480]   emailing these white pages directories online.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.160]   If you just Google your name or your last name and your address in quotes,
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.640]   you'll see the websites that are sharing your address.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.040]   You can reach out to them and get them to remove things.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.280]   A friend of mine recently told me another suggestion, which is to reach to the MLS
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.400]   or have your real estate agent do it and have the photos of the house
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.560]   that you purchased whenever it was removed from the MLS.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.120]   Otherwise, someone has your address.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:22.280]   They can also then just go look inside your house, understand the entire floor plan.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.000]   I'm not saying you're a target of someone understanding the layout of your house,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.720]   but it seems like information that provides very little value to the world
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.280]   for people to be able to look inside every room of your house.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.680]   Obviously, it's not real time.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.080]   It's not your cameras, but it's something I'm going to be doing.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.200]   No, that's important.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   The other thing is you can actually contact like Google and Apple and say,
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.560]   could you blur my house so that if someone's using maps or whatever,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.320]   it's not so easy to go, oh, I see.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.240]   That's where Chris lives.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.960]   Hmm. Well, that's interesting.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.080]   I didn't realize he was as close as he is.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.840]   So these are little tricks of the trade that you can do as well.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.440]   That is another step toward helping you get your stuff
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.480]   offline or at least less accessible.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.800]   I'm trying to think of any other ones that I've done or have thought about.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:14.160]   I have a second phone number on Google Voice that I don't know why,
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.880]   but it seems like every financial institution supports only text message
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.840]   or phone call based two factor off.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.160]   All of the tech companies seem to support using authenticator
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.360]   and one time passwords.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:28.120]   Yeah, but all of my financial institutions, Chase Vanguard,
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.400]   they're only text and it's so frustrating.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.720]   So I've got my Google Voice number that I can use.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.160]   So I'm not using the number
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.080]   that I've given out to so many people, as you mentioned earlier.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.360]   Listen, that's an excellent idea.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.840]   Google Voice for calls, because as we talked about the ubiquity
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.200]   of your cell phone number, it's always good to have another phone number.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.280]   Another scam that was going on is the Google Voice scam.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.960]   And that's where you're supposedly doing business with someone online.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.640]   They go, well, I don't really know if I can trust you.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.720]   So I want to know that you're the real you, that this is really your phone number.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.320]   So I'm going to send you a code and then I want you to read me back the code.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.280]   And what they've actually done is they've applied for a Google Voice number
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.080]   using your phone as the point of authentication.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.720]   And then they will have a code sent to you.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.200]   And then they will ask you to read them the code.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.360]   And that then enables them to contact Google Voice
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.880]   and represent themselves as if they're you.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.920]   I've seen the same thing happen with sending an iCloud two factor code.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.080]   They just pretend that it's something else.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.760]   They say, oh, I want to confirm it's your identity.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.720]   Let me send you a code.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.400]   And they go to Apple and they go in and say, recover my password, send a code.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.040]   And they just hope that you don't notice that code actually is from Apple
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.000]   or that code is from your bank or something like that.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.440]   So I'd say if you're not dealing with a service where you're 100% sure
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.240]   it's the service, which means you called them, you know, if Verizon calls you
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.120]   and says, hey, we'd love to talk to you about your account,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.760]   we're going to send you a code right now and then we can get in.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.240]   I would say thank you.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.480]   But let me call 611 back and get a Verizon rep before proceeding.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.520]   That goes into the category of no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520]   Yes, exactly.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.720]   Now that HTTPS is pretty ubiquitous, right?
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.480]   If you don't already know to look for the secure lock,
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.600]   most browsers will throw off errors if they're not there.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.120]   Do VPNs really matter in these days?
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.040]   I've heard plenty of ads for them.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.160]   But I wonder if now that almost everything we do online is HTTPS,
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.960]   if having a VPN really provides a lot of value other than maybe
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.040]   like your browsing activity, what types of things you're doing,
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.840]   whether you're streaming from different services.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.160]   Well, a VPN also is very helpful when let's say you're connecting
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.400]   to your business network.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.920]   It's always good to use it if your company has a VPN to access things.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   Yes. But the idea of, oh, if you're at a public Wi-Fi spot,
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.720]   you need a VPN to make sure people aren't stealing your information.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.440]   My understanding is that with HTTPS being so prolific
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.160]   and secure certificates being free, that's not really a thing
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.520]   people need to be worried about.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.000]   Well, the only issue is that there have been cases
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.360]   of the secure certificates being stolen.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.400]   OK, so as a result, a VPN is still a good way to go.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   And I like DuckDuckGo, but there were people that will say to you
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.320]   that if you're going to get a VPN, use one you pay for.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.480]   Because they're less likely to sell your information than ones
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.360]   that one day might share your information that are free. Yeah.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:33.320]   That goes back to another thing, too, which is read privacy policies
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.840]   and understand what the privacy policy is, terms and conditions.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.800]   I realize privacy policies in many cases are written in 27th grade English
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.000]   and they're presented to you in mouse print.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.920]   And there are translators where you can actually go
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   and it'll translate what a privacy policy is.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.040]   The name of some of them escapes me right now.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.680]   But this is something we could talk to Travis about, for example,
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.920]   that he might be able to give information on that.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.840]   But anything that you can do to mask your identity is a good thing.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.960]   Even something as simple as location services on your mobile device.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.360]   Many websites now scramble the things that would be identified
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.760]   by location services, but many of them don't.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.520]   And the last thing you want is you're publishing pictures
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.880]   and it shows when and where the picture was taken,
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.080]   especially if it involves people doing things they shouldn't do,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.160]   like exposing their kids too much to people.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.480]   Like an example.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.120]   Here we are at Sustance Hutcher Park and it's little Susie's second birthday.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.200]   And if the location services are on and it's not a site that scrambles them,
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.400]   the issue you have is that somebody could show up one day at that park,
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.560]   find little Susie and say, I feel so terrible that I missed your birthday.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.280]   And I told mommy that I'd be over the park today to see you
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.880]   because I have a present for you if you just come with me over there.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.760]   It's in my car.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.120]   And then all of a sudden you have a missing child.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.160]   So, you know, location services, you should be discreet
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.040]   about when you use them, where you use them.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.000]   And if you can disable them, you do it.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.480]   Of course, I realize that your GPS system won't work and a few other things.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.400]   So, you know, turn them on for that.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.640]   But be careful, know that they can come back to haunt you.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.480]   When I got that Fortalice report, they looked at all the photos
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.720]   that had been published on social media by me, by others around my home address.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.960]   And all of a sudden there are photos that you didn't know of your friends
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.280]   and your family inside your house and all that kind of stuff.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.520]   So one of their recommendations was to go back and remove the geo
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.600]   tags from your photos, from everything you've posted online.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.480]   The only other thing we didn't discuss from tips that I have
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.400]   are going in and doing an audit of things you've offed to your Google account
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.240]   or your Twitter account or your Facebook account.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:06.000]   Yeah, there are so many websites that say, oh, just off your Gmail
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.920]   or oh, just off your Facebook.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.120]   And many of them are legitimate, right?
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   I've offed my Gmail to Calendly so I can schedule meetings.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.360]   But doing an audit every so often of are there services
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.400]   that you've given access to your email or to your social media
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.560]   profiles that you don't use anymore?
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.600]   Or even I noticed that recently I can't remember what service it was,
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.600]   but it's gotten a lot better, right?
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.760]   It used to be all or nothing authentication.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.000]   Some of them now say, what do you want to give information?
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.960]   Do you want to give your name or do you want to give your email
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.000]   or do you want to give full control to post, delete and see everything?
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.880]   And if you authenticated something five years ago,
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.440]   you might not have had the fine grain detail to be able to choose
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.040]   what you give access to.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.160]   So it could even be worth deleting all of them and redoing them
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.640]   to make sure that you're only authenticating the kinds of information
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.080]   you want to the parties you want.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.880]   So that's another kind of audit that I plan on doing.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.960]   You're not wrong about that one at all.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.480]   And you absolutely should do an audit because it's very important
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.600]   to figure out when you're on a particular site where your information is going.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.760]   I have a good friend who has a new company that he started,
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.720]   which is a privacy company.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.280]   And what they do is they can scan a website
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.120]   and then show you all of the different places
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.000]   that your data is going, all the different companies
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.560]   that are sucking up your data that you had no idea.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.320]   And by data, just to be clear, it's usually IP address and activity,
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.240]   not stealing information off your computer and your files and that kind of stuff.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.800]   Right. But it's still IP address.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.400]   You can identify. Yeah.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.800]   And many years ago, they did a someone they were able to identify
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.400]   specifically who they were through analyzing their AOL searches.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.360]   And they were able to actually zero in on the individual.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.640]   And today, people will tell you, give me two or three social media entries
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.080]   and one one receipt.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.520]   And I'll be able to tell you who and where.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.520]   I worked at a company that was dealing with location data,
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.240]   and we were talking to a cell phone carrier.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.880]   And you might not know that just from the towers you're on on your cell phone,
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.520]   the cell phone carriers are logging all of this data.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.000]   And unfortunately, at the time, maybe not now, they're willing to sell this data.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.480]   It doesn't have anything to do with you.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.440]   It's just there is a device.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.560]   It's here, but no one knows who.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.720]   But I remember we did some analysis and it was something like
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.560]   with a reasonable degree of accuracy, you could figure out
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.720]   where any given phone would be at any given time
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.960]   because you had the history of where it had been.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.520]   Now, thankfully, that information was anonymous to the person.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.480]   But you could say this phone that's often at this address is likely to be here.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   It was a little too much.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.240]   I don't want to get people too scared, though, right?
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.400]   You could listen to this and say, oh, my gosh, my kids are going to get abducted.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.360]   People are going to find me.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.240]   They're going to see everything in my house.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.240]   What message do you have to people that will help them get out of that feeling
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.880]   of leaving this thinking everything's coming to an end?
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.840]   I should turn off all my technology and never leave the home.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.880]   Well, interestingly enough, I've had someone say, well, thank you, Adam.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.280]   Now that I've listened to you speak, I'm going home.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.320]   I'm going to disconnect everything.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.960]   I'm going to burn off my fingerprints and I'm going to hide under my mattress.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.080]   I said, but you can't do that unless you're living under a bottle cap
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.960]   at the bottom of Loon Lake and you're completely off the grid, which nobody is.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.120]   You're out there.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.080]   So the question is, just be alert.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.560]   Know what the threats are.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.800]   Know what the red flags are.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.360]   And then practice, for example, the three M's.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.880]   Do everything you can to minimize your risk of exposure.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.120]   Like, for example, when you get a new Internet of Things device,
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.000]   which most things are these days, change the password.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   Most of them come with manufactured default passwords,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.080]   and probably 98% of those passwords are for sale on the dark web.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.960]   So change the password to something long and strong.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.080]   Just read the manual.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.520]   It'll tell you how to do it.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.400]   Just like when you get your router in, make sure that the password
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.920]   is what you want it to be, not what someone else wants it to be.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.280]   And make it as complex as possible.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.840]   Or use a password manager to help you with the whole thing.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.320]   It's really all about two things that people have to understand.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.960]   Number one, we all have day jobs.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.520]   We work. We raise families.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.840]   We're involved in educational activities, philanthropic activities.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.640]   We own companies. We're busy.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.560]   That keeps us excited, interested, but also diverted.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.080]   And to a hacker who's not diverted, we are their day job.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.840]   This is what they do.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.960]   And in some countries, they come in at eight.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.080]   They have their lunch break.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   They go home at 430 or five o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.120]   And it's a job and they're working for the government.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.560]   That's how they raise money.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.760]   That's how they conduct espionage.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.400]   Others work around the clock and do what they do.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.760]   But it is their day job.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.640]   And the second thing to understand is when you look in the mirror, you see you.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:15.160]   And you go, why would anyone in the world want to steal my identity?
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.040]   Why would anyone care?
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.200]   And the answer is simple.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.120]   You see you.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.000]   But when they see you, a hacker, a scammer, an identity thief,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.360]   they see Jay-Z, Beyonce, Adam Levine.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:34.920]   They see somebody who's got something they want that can enrich their lives or.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.200]   And this is not to offend anyone.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.960]   It's not you thereafter, but it's your spouse, your child,
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.240]   your parent, an organization that you're involved with,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.600]   a company that you work for, and you are simply the conduit
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.040]   to get them to whoever or wherever they want to get to.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:59.400]   So this is why it's extremely important that you really focus on cyber hygiene,
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.360]   just like you go to doctors, you go to dentists,
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.960]   you do things that you do to stay healthy.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.400]   You have to maintain a healthy cyber environment
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.680]   because you're protecting yourself, your family,
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.880]   possibly your company, your co-workers and millions of innocent consumers
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.520]   that may be doing business with your company.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.640]   There was a concept that was raised a couple of years ago
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.280]   by the CEO of Microsoft, and I think he was dead right.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.440]   It's called shared responsibility.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.200]   It's that we know that business hasn't done enough.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.920]   We know the government hasn't done enough.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:37.720]   And we know consumers haven't done enough to protect each and every one of us
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.280]   from the ravages of cyber issues or identity theft or ransomware.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.680]   And each of us has a role to play.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.000]   And with consumers, we didn't ask for it.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.240]   We're not trained for it.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.640]   And it's certainly not something we want.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:59.720]   But it's a reality of where we are, what we do, who we are in the world we live in.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:05.080]   And therefore, it's incumbent upon each and every one of us to do our part
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.320]   because we could be protecting a whole lot more people than just ourselves
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.880]   by doing the right thing when it comes to cybersecurity.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.720]   But it's not something that you need to be terrified of because it's reality.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.760]   You're not going to escape it.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.120]   So as a result, it's a question of just like they say with Covid,
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.560]   we've got to live with it.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.200]   So when it comes to cybersecurity, we have to live with it.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.360]   It is not an individual sport.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.600]   It is a group sport. It's team.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.520]   And in addition to which you can't take a victory lap for cybersecurity
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.360]   because you could be completely secure at nine o'clock in the morning
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.360]   and suddenly exposed at nine or one
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.680]   because somebody clicked the wrong link, opened the wrong attachment,
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.120]   gave the wrong information to somebody.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.760]   So if we kind of stick together, work with each other, collaborate,
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.720]   communicate, cooperate, we're going to be better off for it.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.160]   And I think there's a much more collegial attitude now
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.520]   that it comes to cybersecurity than ever before.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.240]   And like you said earlier, with all the information out there,
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.880]   it's only a matter of time before someone decides to pick you as a target.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.160]   That's right. You win the lottery, the one you didn't even enter.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.440]   But I'd say if you can make yourself a harder target
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.080]   by doing a lot of the stuff we talked about today,
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.800]   then you just move yourself further and further down that list
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.320]   where someone says, ah, this person's information isn't very easy to find online.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.400]   Let's just skip to the next person where their address takes me a second to find.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.960]   So it's like the whole issue.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.240]   If you're a burglar, do you break into the house where there's no dog
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.120]   or one where there is a dog where you might not be sure
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.480]   that you're going to come out with both legs?
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.640]   It's important to do that.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.000]   And a very important rule of thumb.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.440]   Any time that anybody contacts you about anything
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.400]   and asks you to authenticate yourself for any reason,
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.360]   however plausible or logical it is, hang up.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.840]   It's one thing if you contact them
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.640]   and they're an organization trying to do the right thing
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.920]   and they're asking you to authenticate yourself.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.400]   But if they contact you, no good.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.520]   Great parting advice.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.600]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.720]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're learning?
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.160]   All of the latest conversations you're having.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.280]   Well, come to AdamLevin.com,
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.480]   which is where we put a lot of information about the newest,
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.760]   scariest, maybe not so scary, but things you need to know.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.160]   We have that on the website.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.840]   Come to What The Hack with Adam Levin.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.360]   You can get it to anywhere you get your podcast.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.920]   Think of it as car talk for cyber.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   There are three of us.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.520]   We try to have a lot of fun with it.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.920]   We focus on a lot of important issues.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:46.960]   We bring people on who have either been victimized
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.560]   or have managed to avoid victimization
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.120]   when it comes to cyber or identity theft.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.560]   And there are a lot of lessons to learn.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.360]   And the whole thing is that
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.160]   this is where scaring is caring and sharing is caring
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.040]   is that the more people that are willing to tell their stories
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.520]   about what they went through and what the red flags were
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.600]   and how to avoid it, the better it is.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.480]   We all gain by it.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.600]   Well, I'm looking forward to joining you and talking about the fact
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.840]   that people always overlook their frequent flyer accounts.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.800]   I think let's lock down my bank account.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   But especially for this audience, you build up credit card points.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.440]   You build up miles to have someone go in and take a flight
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.600]   or drain them to buy a computer is the worst.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.400]   And I've dealt with it.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.520]   So no, it's not fair.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.160]   You did the work to get it.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.200]   Why should somebody get the benefit of your effort?
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.480]   Yeah. So thank you so much for being here.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.480]   I really appreciate it.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.960]   And I enjoyed the conversation.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.360]   Well, thanks for inviting me.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.480]   I enjoyed it very much. Let's do it again.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.440]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.240]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.080]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.520]   in Apple Podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.120]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.640]   hi, I'm Chris at all the hacks dot com or at Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.880]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.600]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.600]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.600]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.600]   And I'm Chris.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.600]   And I'm Chris.
