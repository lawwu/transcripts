[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.460]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.460]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.240]   for another Mailbag episode,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.080]   but this time it's gonna be so much more than Q&A
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.380]   because you all have shared so much.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.680]   So we're also gonna have great deals, hacks,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.580]   and some insurance tips and wins from you all.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.240]   And as I was preparing this,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.640]   also I realized there is way too much for just one episode.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   In fact, there was way too much for two episodes.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.600]   So here's how I'm gonna break it up.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.560]   Today, I'm gonna cover all the best and latest deals,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.560]   but when it comes to hacks and questions,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.520]   I'm gonna focus mostly on money, saving, and investing,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.640]   which includes a very timely discussion
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.160]   about how I'm thinking about banking and investing
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000]   in light of what happened last week with Silicon Valley Bank
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.800]   which fun fact, happens to actually be our bank
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.660]   for checking and our mortgage.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.600]   So yeah, it's been an interesting last few days.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   I'm also gonna talk about where to store cash,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.240]   bank account bonuses, shopping for tires
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.480]   or engagement rings, and a lot more.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.760]   Then I'm gonna take all the amazing travel points
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.640]   and miles, hacks, and questions
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.500]   and talk about those in a few weeks.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.540]   So feel free to send anything else over for that episode.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.680]   And then I'll take all the relationship, family,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.920]   and kids hacks and questions and do another episode.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.120]   But this time I'm gonna have my wife, Amy, join me
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.300]   so you can get her perspective too.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.640]   So if you have any questions you want the two of us
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.600]   to tackle, please send them our way as well.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.000]   But before we jump in, I wanna chat about a few things.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.280]   First for everyone who had an email out to me
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.560]   that I hadn't responded to for a few weeks, I'm so sorry.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920]   I ended up getting hundreds of listener emails
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.600]   in 2023 so far, but as of last night,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.120]   I think I've caught up on every single one of them.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   So to everyone who engaged, asked questions, reached out,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.160]   thank you so much.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.960]   I really appreciate your support.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.900]   Keep it coming.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.760]   And also to the 18 people who've joined
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.440]   the All The Hacks membership, thank you so much.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.960]   Though, however, I did get an email from a listener
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.920]   named Grace who pointed out that she's a bit overwhelmed
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.600]   by creators' memberships.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.800]   So I wanna clarify a few things.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.300]   First, my goal for the membership is to make it something
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.120]   you get way more value from than you put in.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.060]   For example, I'm trying to see if we can set up
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.800]   a travel agency and make all members sub-agents
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.720]   so you can get discounts on travel.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.460]   I'm also working on partnering with brands
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.580]   to get exclusive deals on financial and lifestyle products.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.160]   That said, I don't want it to become just a coupon book
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.560]   of things you won't use, so I'm gonna be really thoughtful
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.140]   about what goes into it.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.400]   In fact, Spotify just launched a new feature
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   to ask your audience a question.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   So if you're listening there or you want to,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   you should see a pop-up.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.480]   Please let me know what perks or benefits you'd wanna see.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.680]   But like I said, I don't have those perks all yet.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.960]   Right now, the membership is really three things.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.160]   It's a monthly video call for members
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.460]   where we can discuss whatever is top of mind,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.700]   whether that's me live screen sharing, searching for flights,
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.720]   giving advice on a credit card,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.040]   or giving my take on a financial question
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.760]   or decision you have to make.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.920]   Second, I wanna invite you behind the scenes
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.000]   with a podcast.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.120]   So when I book guests, I'm gonna send an email out
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.440]   to solicit questions you wanna propose I ask them
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.300]   in the interview, or I might get your take on a new idea,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.000]   like when I was considering launching
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.720]   city or country travel-focused episodes.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.280]   And third, I'm gonna flag members in my inbox
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.560]   so I can get back to you guys as fast as possible.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.080]   I still plan to reply to every email I get,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.760]   so it's not gonna be a gate.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.240]   Don't worry.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.080]   So if that sounds like it's worth it to you,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.820]   which right now is $10 a month or $100 a year,
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.960]   I'd love to have you join at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.880]   But please don't feel the pressure to join right now
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.200]   if you don't want to.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.460]   I mean, you're also welcome to join
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.000]   if you just wanna support me in the show,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   but there are so many other ways you can do that
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.840]   by sharing the show with your friends or colleagues,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.400]   leaving a rating, a review,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.760]   using the card links I have on the website,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.360]   checking out our sponsors,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.480]   or even just listening every week.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.120]   So to Grace and anyone else feeling exhausted
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.280]   with people pitching you to join their membership,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.520]   please do not feel any pressure here,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.200]   and hopefully I can add enough value to the membership
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.160]   that you wanna join and even save money each year
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.540]   by being a part.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.040]   So with that aside, we have a lot to cover,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.800]   but one quick thing, huge, huge congratulations
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.320]   to my editor, Ben, who welcomed his first child
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.800]   into the world last week.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.480]   If you notice the audio quality on this
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.420]   has dropped a little from our normal episodes,
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.400]   that's because I was doing it myself.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.320]   So as soon as Ben's back, things will get a lot better.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   Let's jump in right after this.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.740]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.240]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.840]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.480]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.880]   as you build your wealth.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.160]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.000]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.160]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.720]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.120]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.080]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.400]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.540]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.900]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.620]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.420]   are first generation wealth,
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.500]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.640]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.980]   and learn from each other
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.580]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.860]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.200]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.620]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.780]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.740]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.220]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.660]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.320]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.780]   So many of these conversations
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.980]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.660]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.520]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.700]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.780]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.900]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.420]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.380]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.420]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.820]   So the first thing I wanna tackle is a follow-up
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.060]   to the episode I did a few weeks ago on insurance.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.100]   I got a few emails from listeners,
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.240]   and I just wanted to share some of the experience
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.280]   they've had and update you guys on where I ended up.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.480]   So ultimately, for some reason that I don't understand,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   we thought we were gonna go with Travelers,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.340]   but their underwriting team thought that our home,
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.240]   which is not in a wildfire area,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.700]   was at too high of a risk for wildfires and said no.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.680]   So we ended up going with USAA,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.020]   which I actually anticipated being more expensive,
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.240]   but it turns out that the bundled pricing
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   for auto insurance at USAA
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920]   is something they can't quote in advance
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.800]   and even mistakenly told me wouldn't exist.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.760]   But by the time I ended up getting the home policy set up
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.120]   and adding auto, the total price was less
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.760]   than it would have been with Travelers,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.920]   and the entire experience online,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.360]   getting everything set up was so easy.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   And I'm pretty excited that they're in the number one
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   or number two spot on Consumer Reports.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.140]   Obviously, I haven't had any claims yet in a few days,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.160]   but I'm feeling really happy
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.840]   with the decision to move over there.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.560]   And it just feels nice to have all my insurance policies
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.820]   in one place.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.920]   One good tip, when you go to cancel insurance policies
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.440]   with your next insurance carrier,
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.800]   if you're in that situation,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.300]   they will generally, at least GEICO and Lemonade were fine,
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.340]   backdating to the date that the new policy kicked in,
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.840]   because at least in one case,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.200]   it took me a few days to get things organized
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.400]   and give them a call.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.820]   So that's one thing to know.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.840]   Also, I'm feeling good because Billy is a listener
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.120]   who reached out and said he's been a USAA member
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.760]   for 18 years, and while his rates have gone up
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.440]   a little over time, which I think is true of every carrier,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.080]   he said the service has been amazing
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.760]   and they've gone above and beyond,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.260]   and he's been so impressed.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.580]   So I'm very happy.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.160]   If anyone has any questions about my experience,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.440]   let me know, I'll update you if anything happens,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.240]   but so far, I'm very excited to have everything
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.160]   set up there.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.720]   A few other things people wrote back.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.160]   So funny enough, I got an email from John who said
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.200]   he actually was a USA member for 20 years
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.240]   and the rates kept getting so much more expensive
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.220]   that he ended up deciding to shop around
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.320]   and he was using Policy Genius
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.440]   and had a great experience.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.240]   So if you're looking for a broker online,
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.720]   John wrote in and is now saving more than $1,000 a year
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.280]   on all of his policies.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.880]   Funny enough, I think John's also in the Bay Area.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.800]   So for him, switching carriers away from USA
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.960]   was a lot of savings.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.380]   For me, switching to USA was a lot of savings.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.200]   I think, you know, it just undermines the necessity
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.680]   for everyone to go out there and price this themselves.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.560]   So definitely recommend that.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.520]   I've used Policy Genius in the past
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.280]   and gotten some good results,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.880]   but do keep in mind, not all carriers
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.640]   are able to price through Policy Genius.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   So for some, you're gonna need to go price on your own
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.160]   if you really wanna do an exhaustive search.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.400]   And unfortunately, it also means that
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.720]   just because I found the best rates at Travelers or USA
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.080]   doesn't mean that even if you live in the same part
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   of the country, might have the same experience
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.500]   because it's so much driven on so many factors
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.840]   that are outside of your and my control.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.340]   When it comes to pet insurance though,
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.880]   I did get two emails from Adam and Aya,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.160]   both of which highly recommended Embrace for pet insurance.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   They both said that it was so easy to work with them.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.380]   They paid back their claims very quickly
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.760]   and they've been so happy.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.120]   Aya actually sent me her referral code
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   and said, "If anyone listening needs pet insurance,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.700]   "I really recommend Embrace
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.120]   "and here's my referral code if someone needs it."
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.240]   So I'm gonna put her link in the show notes.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   I'm actually gonna link allthehacks.com/embrace,
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.900]   E-M-B-R-A-C-E, to Aya's referral code.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.180]   So if you wanna send her some love
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.640]   and you're looking for pet insurance,
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.880]   definitely check that out.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.800]   I don't have any personal experience,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   but reading Aya and Adam's strong endorsement
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.520]   makes me think that if I'm getting pet insurance,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.140]   I don't even know if I need to look around.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.360]   I might just start there
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.720]   because they had such strong things to say.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.960]   One more thing from Jeffrey, who by the way,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.600]   just came back from a trip to Milan
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.360]   where he pointed out that he was able to fly in business
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.440]   for 150,000 points and some fees,
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.200]   had an amazing trip to Italy, used point.me,
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.540]   had a great experience.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.440]   But he said that the firm he works at
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.520]   practices in the area of significant personal injury.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.220]   And he wanted to emphasize how many times
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.960]   a catastrophic event happens
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.920]   and clients are left with almost nothing
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.600]   because the person who injured them was either not insured
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.840]   or only had the state minimums.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.080]   He said, "It is really, really important
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.560]   that people consider getting the maximum amount
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.280]   of uninsured and underinsured motorists possible,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.820]   which in California is limited to the amount you carry
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.420]   on your own liability."
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.120]   Jeffrey said, "The cost is so minimal
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.720]   and it would have made such a huge difference so many times."
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.040]   So he really wanted to emphasize
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.320]   how much people should consider
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.300]   making sure they have that coverage.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.840]   Finally, I got a long email from Joel.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.000]   Thank you for everything.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.560]   Just to highlight how important disability insurance was.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.520]   He's actually had multiple people in his life,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.080]   colleagues and family members,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.280]   who have been in the unfortunate situation
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.760]   of needing to rely on their disability insurance.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.280]   And he's very thankful that the ones that had it, had it.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.240]   And just wanted to point out that
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.160]   disabilities can be more common than people realize.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.480]   Everything from accidents, falling off a horse,
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.760]   things at work that workers comp doesn't cover enough of
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   beyond a certain timeframe.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.080]   That he had a lot of experiences
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.660]   where people really benefited from having it
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.360]   and wanted to make sure that people had another data point
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.760]   since I personally don't have any
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   of those experiences to share.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.120]   So that's a little recap from the insurance episode.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.240]   Now I wanna talk about deals
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.120]   'cause there's a handful of deals happening right now
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.200]   that I think are worth knowing about.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.680]   First, very timely because you have to book it by tomorrow,
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.320]   which is March 16th.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.880]   Southwest is doing a sale 20% off all award flights.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.120]   You have to fly by May 24th,
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.680]   but the promo code is SAVE20NOW.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.440]   So if you're looking at a Southwest flight
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.000]   and you have points to do it,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.300]   you can get 20% off as long as you book today or tomorrow.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.040]   Chase Freedom, if you have a Freedom card starting today,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.840]   you can go to chasebonus.com
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.440]   and you should be able to register for the next bonus,
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   which for Q2 is on Amazon and Lowe's.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.640]   That's 5% cash back up to $1,500 of spend.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.200]   But if you also have a Sapphire card,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.080]   you can actually take that cash back
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   and convert it to points.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.160]   So it's a great combo card.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.360]   And if you have any home improvement projects,
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.060]   maybe Q2 is the time to pick stuff up at Lowe's
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.360]   and we're probably all shopping on Amazon.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.560]   So it might make sense to use your Freedom card
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.880]   if you have one for Amazon for the next three months.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.480]   Starting April 1st, of course,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.760]   not three months starting now.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.960]   There are also a few card bonuses
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.320]   that are worth sharing right now
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.220]   because they are a lot higher than I've seen in recent past.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.000]   In fact, the Inc. Business Cash and Unlimited bonuses
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.900]   are the all-time best I've ever seen.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.560]   Now you might be thinking, I don't have a business,
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.440]   but I wanna be clear that you probably do have a business.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.880]   Technically, if you sell something at a yard sale
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.040]   or on eBay, or you do any consulting or writing
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.320]   or handyman services or have a rental property
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.240]   or have ever driven for Lyft or done TaskRabbit,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.880]   any of those things, even if you don't have an LLC,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.120]   even if you don't have a business set up,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.240]   are still considered a sole proprietorship
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.040]   and so you can qualify for a business credit card.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.100]   In fact, when you apply for a business credit card,
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.920]   you can use your name as the business name,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.600]   your address as your business address,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.320]   your phone number as your business phone number,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.840]   and your own social as the business tax ID
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.200]   because sole proprietorships
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.420]   actually don't have their own tax ID.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.520]   So you might be way more eligible
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.960]   for a business card than you think.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.760]   And right now, the Chase Inc. Business Cash
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.720]   and Inc. Business Unlimited both have a $900 bonus,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.520]   but like the Freedom card,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.240]   if you have a Chase Sapphire card
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.880]   or an Inc. Business Preferred,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.800]   you can use that $900 of bonus cash
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.600]   as 90,000 ultimate rewards points,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.840]   which is an awesome bonus.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.480]   Both of the cards, by the way, also have no annual fee.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.720]   So we're talking about a no annual fee card
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.240]   with a 90,000 point signup bonus,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.000]   really, really great cards.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.960]   The Business Unlimited earns 1 1/2% on everything,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.280]   which, like I said, if you pair with the right cards,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.760]   is 1 1/2 points.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.480]   And the Inc. Business Cash gives you 5% cash back
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.880]   or 5X points at office supply stores
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.440]   and on internet, cable, and phone services.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.000]   And you get 2% back or 2X points on gas and restaurants.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.120]   So two great opportunities.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.200]   For both of those cards,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.960]   you need to spend 6,000 in the first three months.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.000]   So I think this could be a great opportunity
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.220]   if you're eligible.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.360]   The Inc. Business Preferred
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.840]   does have a 100,000 point bonus signup,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.200]   or $1,000 if you redeemed it on cash,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.240]   but you need to spend $15,000
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.480]   and there's a $95 annual fee.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.920]   So yes, it's more points,
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.960]   but to get just 10,000 less points for no fee
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.560]   and not needing to spend that much
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.420]   in the first three months,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.800]   I think it's a great opportunity.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.640]   One other thing I did read online
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.080]   is that usually you can't get a card that you already have
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   and you can't qualify for the bonus
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.120]   if you've had it in the last 24 months.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.760]   But I've read a couple reports online
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.080]   that these rules don't apply to Chase Inc. cards.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.260]   So some people have even been able to get a card
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.420]   for the same business that they already have
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.760]   and get the bonus.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.460]   So definitely a lot of opportunities right now.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.820]   The reason I'm talking about this now
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.420]   is that these bonuses expire March 21st.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.680]   So get in in the next week if you're interested.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.860]   I'll put the links to all these in the show notes,
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.520]   or you can go to allthehacks.com/inccash/incunlimited
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.240]   or /incpreferred,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.100]   or just go to allthehacks.com/cards
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.300]   and find the links there.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.900]   Few other card bonuses worth considering.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.740]   If you've been thinking about
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.500]   getting a Chase Sapphire Preferred,
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.880]   there has been a rumor posted around online
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.040]   that the bonus is going up to 80,000 points,
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.020]   but you're only gonna be able to open that card
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.780]   with an offer from a branch starting on March 19th.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.900]   So if that's something you're considering,
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.360]   like I always say, use the best offer you can get.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.820]   It doesn't have to be mine.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.460]   So in that case, sign up for this Chase Preferred
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.580]   in a Chase branch.
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.780]   If you can find a branch that has that offer there
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.060]   after March 19th.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.540]   A few other quick ones.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.020]   The Amex Gold and Platinum offers right now
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.100]   are really high for referrals.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.180]   So that's 90,000 points for Gold
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.700]   and 150,000 points for Platinum.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.460]   That means again, my links aren't gonna work,
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.980]   but I have found some referral links online.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.000]   I can't promise how long they'll all work for,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.480]   but I'll put them in the show notes
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.540]   or at allthehacks.com/amexgold or amexplatinum.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.340]   If you have referral links yourself
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.640]   for either of those offers,
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.380]   the 90,000 Gold or the 150,000 Platinum,
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.920]   please feel free to send them to me
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.820]   and I'll replace those redirects
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.760]   and then links in the show notes to your offers
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.660]   because I'd love you guys to earn points.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.540]   Unfortunately, my referral bonuses
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.140]   when I log into Amex's site are much lower
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.060]   and I'd rather you guys get the most points.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.300]   So I just found some referral links online.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.500]   At the end of the day,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.380]   as much as I want you guys to be able
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.500]   to support me in the show,
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.140]   I want you to get more points.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.180]   So I'm always gonna find the best links I can.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.240]   Last two other cards to consider.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.340]   One timely one is that the IHG Premier card
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.340]   has an all-time best offer of 175,000 bonus points.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.420]   The Points Guy values IHG points at about half a cent.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.740]   So this is about a $875 value offer, which is pretty high.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.040]   But if you are looking at doing some bookings
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.220]   at IHG properties,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.700]   you can probably make those points go a little bit further.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.100]   So something worth considering
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.440]   because this is the best offer I've ever seen on that card.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.940]   Finally, Delta launched an amazing perk
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.120]   for all of their SkyMiles cards.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.460]   And that's that you get 15% off the points you need
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.700]   for an award flight when you have a Delta card.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.620]   So for example, if you and your partner
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.180]   are looking to book a trip to Europe
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.940]   and it's gonna cost 150,000 points total,
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.600]   you're actually gonna save 22,500 points for that booking
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.820]   just by holding a Delta Amex.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.420]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/cards,
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.340]   you'll see all the Delta Amex cards.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:51.620]   They do have 70 to 90,000 point signup bonuses right now,
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.720]   which is pretty decent.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.540]   But the real big perk there is that you get 15% back.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.080]   So I'm actually considering getting
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.220]   the Delta Platinum card myself right now.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.500]   Yes, it has a $250 annual fee.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.980]   However, you get 90,000 bonus miles when you get the card,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.060]   you get a free companion certificate each year,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.100]   you get that 15% off anytime you book with Delta,
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.660]   and you get your first check bag free for you
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.660]   and up to eight other people on a reservation.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.060]   All those things combined, I think will more than make up
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.980]   for the $250 annual fee.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.260]   Not to mention, we've got a few trips coming up
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.700]   where I think we're gonna be flying Delta,
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.620]   so that 15% off would actually come in a lot of handy.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.980]   So that's one I'm really considering.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.500]   That's all for cards right now.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.200]   I'm hoping we get some really big, great monster bonuses
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.160]   over 100,000 later this year,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.060]   and I will be sure to tell you about them.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.140]   A few more deals.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.060]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.300]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.860]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.020]   and my info as possible.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.860]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.020]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.000]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.260]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.220]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.420]   and instead of spending 50 plus hours
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.780]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.260]   it only took a few minutes,
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.340]   because I used Delete.me from A-Bine,
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.420]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.380]   for this episode.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.380]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.460]   and remove your personal information
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.260]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.380]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.020]   and get that removed as well.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.940]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.300]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.820]   in their first two years,
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.700]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.620]   for their customers.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.700]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.180]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.220]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.740]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.780]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.100]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.260]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.280]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.220]   but one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.660]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first,
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.500]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.140]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.240]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.540]   for this episode.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.580]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.840]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave,
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.180]   and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.180]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.820]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.740]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.940]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.140]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.780]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.960]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.260]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.580]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.660]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.780]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.780]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.100]   So first, I can't remember if I already mentioned this,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.240]   but I don't think I'd personally signed up for it,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.160]   so now I did.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.980]   You can get Lift Pink for free
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.300]   as a Chase Sapphire Reserve member,
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.560]   gets you some free cancellations, priority pickup,
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.060]   three scooter or e-bike passes a year,
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.080]   unlimited 45-minute classic bike rides,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.040]   as well as free Grubhub Plus for a year.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.140]   So you get two years of that
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.180]   as a Chase Sapphire Reserve member.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.420]   I'll put a link to the show notes
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.640]   where you can sign up for that.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.700]   There's also two transfer bonuses to Virgin right now
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.340]   from Capital One and Citi.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.980]   The Citi one expires in a few days,
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.520]   the Capital One at the end of the month,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.580]   but you'll get 30% extra points transferring to Virgin.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.940]   So if there's a trip you wanna take
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.780]   and Virgin Miles are the way to do it,
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.140]   definitely worth checking that out.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.260]   I'll also link in the show notes,
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.820]   Virgin Atlantic just launched this really cool
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.060]   reward flight finder on their website
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.740]   where you can put in a Citi pair
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.540]   and it'll show you for any month when there are seats
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.480]   and how many there are in different classes.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.180]   Makes it really easy to search for availability on Virgin
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.700]   or on Delta flights to the UK.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.660]   It doesn't look like you can search for flights from the US,
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.020]   so just search for London to the US
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.660]   and then as soon as you get to the search results,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.420]   you can hit return and see the other way as well.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.880]   Last set of deals.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.460]   There are a ton of offers on Amex and Chase's site
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.180]   that I think are worth considering.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.580]   And then I'll talk about why I don't actually
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.740]   have to think about a lot of them.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.580]   So on Amex, there's an offer for 10% off insurance bills
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.780]   up to $30.
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.260]   Fortunately, I have a lot of insurance bills,
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.340]   so I'm gonna use that one.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.500]   If you need anything electronic that you can get from Dell
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.320]   that costs over $600, you can get $120 back.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.180]   If you are going to a Hilton resort,
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.700]   there's a $20 off $1,000.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.660]   We just did the episode on Japan
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.220]   and I saw an offer on ZipAir for $150 off $750.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.980]   So if you're looking to make a last minute trip to Japan,
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.300]   there's a great deal.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.620]   50% off Dropbox, deals on TaxAct and TurboTax,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.660]   $60 off $300 at Marriott.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.300]   And then there's a $15 off phone bill offer
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.900]   as long as your phone bill is over $115.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.300]   And I think you can use it a few times.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.180]   So those are the Amex deals.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.420]   On Chase, similarly, you can get deals
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.500]   on TurboTax and TaxAct.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.580]   My Southwest card on Chase also has a 10% off Southwest deal.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.960]   So I'm looking at a Southwest flight right now
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.700]   for later this year, so I think I'm gonna buy that soon.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.580]   And then there's a deal on Panera Bread.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.020]   And I only say Panera Bread,
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.420]   not because I think everyone listening
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.020]   is going to Panera Bread, but I was with my parents
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.220]   and that's what we ended up doing for lunch.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.180]   And I didn't think to go to Chase
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.340]   before I went to Panera and add the offer.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.940]   But sure enough, I noticed that I got credit
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.660]   for a Panera Bread discount.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.100]   And that is because I signed up for Card Pointers.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.500]   And if you use Card Pointers and their browser extension,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.460]   anytime you log into Chase or Amex's website,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.820]   they will automatically add all these offers to your cards.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.700]   So I think three or four times now,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.860]   I've spent money at a retailer on my card
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.660]   without adding the offer,
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.660]   or at least without knowing that I added the offer,
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.620]   but then I've gotten the credit back.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.380]   Amex had one where it was like $5 off restaurants
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.740]   during a certain month and it was automatically added.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.420]   So I love that Card Pointers does this,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.160]   but there's one thing that I think a lot of people
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.480]   don't realize Card Pointers does, which is even better,
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.060]   which is they will simultaneously hit the Chase
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.460]   and Amex APIs and request adding those offers
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.340]   to every card at the same time, which is important
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.300]   because if you've ever tried this yourself,
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.260]   you might see an offer on multiple cards,
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.700]   but as soon as you add it to one,
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.700]   it usually doesn't show up with the other cards.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.860]   But Card Pointers requests it all at the exact same time.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.120]   And so you're actually able to load those offers
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.700]   on multiple cards, which means you can redeem
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.660]   those offers multiple times.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.780]   So if you have a 10% off your insurance bill
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.020]   up to $30 back, you could go make a $300 payment
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.400]   on every single Amex you have and get $30 for each one.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.900]   So I've gotten a ton of value out of this already,
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.100]   probably more than pays for the annual fee
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.700]   if you want Card Pointers Pro.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.060]   There is a 20% discount on Card Pointers Pro
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.020]   for all the Hacks members.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.660]   Just go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.740]   and make sure you check out the extension
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.260]   if you wanna auto enroll in all these offers
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.640]   every time you log in.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.420]   And I think hopefully over the course of a year,
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.740]   I'd be surprised if you didn't find at least one thing
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.740]   that you earned cash back for without even realizing it.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.360]   So that's a lot of deals right now.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.380]   Hopefully that's helpful.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.660]   Hopefully something in there will help you save some money
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.540]   or get some extra points.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.140]   Let's jump on to Hacks and Questions.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.320]   But first, I just wanna share a couple wins
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.500]   because I love hearing these stories.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.460]   So when it comes to unclaimed money,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.620]   I keep getting these amazing stories
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.820]   and I'm just gonna share them
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.060]   because a few people actually said,
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.140]   "Hey, I didn't think it was gonna work,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.980]   "so I didn't do it.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.380]   "Finally, I did and wow.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.000]   "I have one listener got $93 back,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.160]   "but then became obsessed with checking unclaimed money
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.660]   "for their friends and family.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.340]   "And at one night found over $1,000
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.220]   "and one person had over 500 owed to them.
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.980]   "Then Jeff reached out and said,
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.460]   "Hey, you've mentioned this a few times.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.900]   "I was super careful.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.180]   "I'm always running spreadsheets
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.460]   "to make sure I change everything.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.020]   "I didn't think it would be me.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.780]   "Finally, I added it to my list
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.420]   "and I found a $250 insurance refund
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.820]   "and then another $320 from a state
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.580]   "he and his wife used to live in."
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.100]   He said all three of those places
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.700]   should have had their updated address,
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.400]   but somehow they sent the money to the state instead.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.340]   And Jeff's message to everyone listening
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.740]   is that if an ultra careful guy like him can find $600,
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.540]   everyone needs to go on the hunt.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.120]   He would have bet anything that no money would be there
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.220]   when he searched and $600 later, he was wrong.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.880]   Jeff, I'm glad you found that money.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.780]   Cameron, I'm glad you found another $80
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.240]   and then 450 for your friends.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.100]   And then Emilio, I am the most happy for you
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.840]   because he found that his undergraduate school
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.320]   where he graduated 15 years ago
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.660]   had $1,359 waiting for him
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.680]   in his state's unclaimed money pool.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.380]   So he had to go through a little bit of hassle,
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.500]   creating an account, verifying his email,
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.420]   uploading some personal documents.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.580]   But two months later,
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.240]   he got over $1,000 from the state of Virginia.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.740]   So I'll just tell everyone one more time,
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.380]   if you haven't already searched for unclaimed money,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.980]   definitely go do that, definitely worth it.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.420]   Another hack from a past episode was Michael
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.420]   who long story short, got screwed by his insurance
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.180]   and his son wasn't covered after he was born.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.220]   He had a bill of close to $7,000
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.580]   and he went back and forth,
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.960]   followed some of the tips from my episode with Marshall Allen
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.020]   and got the bill down to $1,800.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.900]   Paid off a thousand, still owed 800
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.460]   and asked them if he paid 500,
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.500]   would they call it even and they said yes.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.480]   So it just goes to show,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.060]   yes, insurance would have been great,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.540]   but if you're in a situation where you have a medical bill,
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.060]   please make sure you fight back and negotiate.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.520]   Go back and listen to episode 34 of all the hacks
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.020]   if you need some tips,
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.060]   but there's always a way to get that price down.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.260]   And finally, had an awesome Apple review
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.940]   from a listener, Fit Gravity, who said,
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.500]   "Love the show, I'm so glad I discovered this podcast.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.980]   "Love the content, the topics
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.040]   "and getting real practical tips.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.020]   "I just saved $260 on the purchase of a washer and dryer
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.460]   "from Home Depot using a hack I learned on the show
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.620]   "that I wanna share.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.140]   "I was about to buy a 15% off coupon from Save & Deals,
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.540]   "which is a site I've shared before
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.060]   "that I'll put in the show notes,
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.880]   "but then they realized it couldn't be applied
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.460]   "to a purchase on sale.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.220]   "So they quickly chatted with customer support and boom,
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.640]   "they were offered a discount that was actually eligible
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.440]   "for the sale price already.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.700]   "And finally made the purchase
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.200]   "through the Capital One Shopping Portal
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.700]   "with a 5% cashback offer from Home Depot
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.060]   "to sweeten the deal."
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.960]   That is so awesome.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.160]   I love stumbling upon stories like this in reviews.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.560]   And speaking of them, I'm at 904 reviews on Apple Podcasts
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.420]   and I have a goal to get to 1000.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.940]   So any help would be greatly appreciated.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.340]   Thank you so much.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.340]   Okay, I keep saying we're gonna get to hacks
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.180]   and here we are.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.900]   I wanna share a bunch of awesome hacks
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.060]   that I've learned from you all that you've sent in.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.940]   And then I wanna answer a bunch of questions
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.100]   and come back to the big elephant in the room,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.540]   which is how am I rethinking about money
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.020]   now that my primary bank has more or less collapsed?
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.300]   Although maybe not, but I'll get to that.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.060]   But here are some hacks that I wanna share.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.100]   First from Ben, he started off sharing a hack
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.340]   that I think I've shared before,
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.260]   which is that if you wanna make large purchases,
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.340]   you can always take a card that gets you a bonus
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.640]   at the grocery store and buy gift cards.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.060]   But he pointed out that if you're going to Kroger,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.700]   and oftentimes this is also true in Safeway,
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.340]   if you use their app,
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.280]   you can activate bonus points for fuel.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.260]   Every time he's had these big purchases,
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.700]   he buys gift cards, activates the Forex fuel points,
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.460]   and has been doing this a lot.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.780]   Funny enough, he doesn't even have a car that uses gas,
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.780]   but he keeps adding these deals
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.620]   to his father-in-law's account.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.540]   And he said his father-in-law has been tracking
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.660]   the amount he's saved, filling his car with diesel gas.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.700]   And last year he saved over $1,000.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.420]   So this is probably true,
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.980]   even if you're just buying groceries,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.540]   but don't forget to use that grocery app
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.980]   to add fuel points if you're making purchases,
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.260]   but also don't forget to add the deals.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.740]   Every time I'm going to Safeway,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.280]   I look in the Safeway app and they have deals
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   that you don't see in the store always
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.620]   that are so much better.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.260]   Just yesterday, I added a $5 off coupon.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.300]   In the past, I've added a free gallon of milk,
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.740]   a free carton of eggs, $1 strawberries,
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.100]   a free avocado, all kinds of stuff.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.120]   So definitely recommend checking out the grocery store apps
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.260]   because there's some deals in there that are awesome.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.980]   When it comes to renting a car,
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.500]   Ed wanted to share that as much as it might seem ridiculous,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.100]   if rental cars are expensive,
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.380]   don't forget to look at U-Haul.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.460]   He said, yes, it might've been inconvenient,
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.500]   but he has definitely rented a 10 foot box truck in the past
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.100]   because rental cars were more expensive.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.500]   So Ed, great tip.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.700]   Now I want to share another hack
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.540]   for getting a deal on phones.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.980]   Two things, one's mine and one's from Phaedra.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.980]   So Phaedra pointed out that every now and then,
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.460]   AT&T and Verizon have really, really high values on trade-ins
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.900]   so she was able to get $1,000 off a new iPhone
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.340]   by trading in any phone on a list of approved devices.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.540]   One of those was a Samsung S20
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.940]   that she went on Craigslist and bought for $300
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.580]   and got the full thousand dollar trade-in value.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.320]   So anytime these carriers are running these deals
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.940]   for huge discounts if you trade in your phone,
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.620]   even if you don't have an eligible phone,
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.680]   definitely go search for it.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.780]   There's another discount that often happens
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.460]   where you get a huge discount
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.760]   for porting a number into your line,
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.020]   but it's not just adding a new line,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.800]   the discount comes if you port the number
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.140]   from another carrier.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.340]   Now, recently I learned that the hack for this
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.420]   is a website called Phone Barn
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.620]   where you can actually buy phone numbers
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.980]   and port them over.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.180]   So for a few dollars, you can buy a phone number,
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.700]   port it over, and oftentimes get huge savings
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.740]   on a new phone by porting a phone number
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.020]   over from somewhere else.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.280]   Definitely something to work out.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.260]   You can even check the eligibility of the number usually
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.580]   before you buy it.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.100]   Next, concerts.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.740]   On Twitter, Soy Henry shared that his favorite hack
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.780]   is buying tickets minutes before
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.900]   or even after an event has started.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.440]   He said people end up panic selling
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.180]   and there's great opportunities.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.480]   This is something I've used a lot in New York
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.300]   for going to Broadway shows.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.180]   There used to be a FedEx office store,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.940]   or maybe it was FedEx Kinko's back then,
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.300]   around Times Square.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.100]   So if we wanted to go to a Broadway show
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.740]   and we looked like there were a lot of tickets on StubHub,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.380]   we would just go a few minutes before
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.900]   and wait and wait and wait for the price to drop
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.800]   because people were quickly dropping them
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.020]   so that they could get sold and not go lost.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.960]   Back before you could necessarily do them all on mobile,
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.980]   we would just walk into the FedEx store,
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.780]   we would print out the tickets and walk into the show
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.940]   having just bought them a few minutes before.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.040]   So that's definitely an awesome hack.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.160]   Another one that Sean's shared is that he uses
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.460]   the Amex emails on early access to concert tickets
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.260]   all the time, and his Amex Platinum got him
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.780]   face value early access to six row Red Hot Chili Peppers
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.140]   tickets before they went on sale to the general public.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.880]   So there are a few hacks for concerts.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.860]   This is a little one, but I really liked it.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.480]   Nirav pointed out that if you're using any apps
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.780]   that can let you reassign keys,
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.060]   the Karabiner app on Mac is one of them.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.760]   He loves reassigning the caps lock key.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.020]   And I'm always thinking about keyboard shortcuts
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.020]   and trying to come up with something really obscure
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.940]   that isn't being used,
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.260]   but I never really thought about the fact
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.040]   that I never use caps lock.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.080]   So you've got this big key on your keyboard.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.700]   If you can use an app like Karabiner to remap it,
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.420]   then you're able to do a lot of cool stuff.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.980]   So he remaps it to actually be the equivalent of F13,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.060]   which is not a real key in Karabiner.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.340]   And then he can use that to trigger a lot of other things
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.180]   on his computer.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.660]   Two more, one from Suheetha.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.500]   I think you've all heard me talk about how much I love
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.040]   the app Paprika for managing recipes,
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.380]   but it can get a little expensive and they charge it
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.060]   for every single platform.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.380]   And so she pointed out that Crouton is a similar app
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.780]   that's less expensive.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.480]   I actually downloaded it today and started importing
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.420]   recipes and I was pretty impressed.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.300]   They have a Mac app and an iPhone app.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   It was really simple, really nice.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.060]   If I didn't already pay for Paprika,
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.900]   I would definitely consider it because I think
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.340]   if you purchase it within the first 24 hours,
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.460]   it's just $10 across all platforms.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.580]   So if you're looking for a recipe and meal planning app
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.220]   and Paprika was too expensive, check out Crouton.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   And finally, a big shout out to Mindy
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.260]   from BiggerPocketsMoney who said that she has a great hack
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.180]   for Target, though it works at lots of different places.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.580]   When they have a sale on car seats,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.260]   which happens a couple times a year,
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.580]   they often give 20% additional off
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.720]   if you bring in a used car seat.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.280]   She said, even if you don't have a used car seat,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.740]   you can typically find them really, really affordably
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:48.920]   or free on Craigslist, Freecycle, Buy Nothing groups
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.080]   or anything, Target will dispose of them anyway.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.900]   So it doesn't matter what the condition is,
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.720]   but you can get an extra 20% off there.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.220]   So another great tip there, love that one.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.460]   Thank you for sending all these great hacks in.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.780]   I'm gonna keep sharing them.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.380]   I've got a bunch from travel that I'm excited to share
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.320]   in the next time we do this episode,
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.980]   but please keep sending them in
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.220]   and let's jump in to questions.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.100]   So Jessica wrote in asking for my thoughts on SVB
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.660]   and boy, do I have some.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.360]   You all know the sound, right?
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.540]   It's the best kind of notification,
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.700]   the sound of another sale on Shopify
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.980]   and the moment another business dream becomes a reality.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.940]   Shopify is the commerce platform
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.580]   revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.380]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.740]   Whether you're selling Japanese tea or custom travel guides,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.740]   both of which I would have loved to share in this episode,
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.080]   Shopify simplifies selling online and in person
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.100]   so you can focus on successfully growing your business
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.060]   and they even let you sell across social media marketplaces
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.660]   like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.540]   What's incredible to me about Shopify
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.540]   is that no matter how big you wanna grow,
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.980]   Shopify is there to empower you with the confidence
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.880]   and control to take your business to the next level.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.420]   Now it's your turn to get serious
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.720]   about starting your business and try Shopify today.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.420]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period

[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.460]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.020]   and Viore is one of them
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.900]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.980]   for this episode.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.200]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.860]   Everything is designed to work out in
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.420]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.200]   and it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.300]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.120]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.820]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.420]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.860]   And it's not just for men.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.260]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.920]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.380]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.860]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.940]   I've ever owned.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.740]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.820]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.720]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.900]   but they're also great for lounging
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.140]   or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.100]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.420]   and for all the hacks listeners,
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.880]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.740]   as well as free shipping and returns
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.460]   on any US order over $75.

[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.360]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.820]   She wanted to know how to proceed as it relates
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.420]   to everything she's doing with her personal finances.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.260]   She actually had some questions
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.860]   about Wealthfront and BlockFi, so I'll get to all of it.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.720]   But first off, I will say that the way everything unfolded
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.820]   with SVB, while slightly terrifying,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.800]   ended up in a place that I'm feeling a lot more confident
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.140]   with what FDIC insurance actually means.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.660]   I think I was a little stressed out
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.060]   because we just didn't have access to any of our money.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.740]   And in fact, as of recording this on Tuesday night,
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.180]   I still don't because we tried to wire our money
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.340]   out of SVB, not knowing the future.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.060]   They ended up debiting all the money out of our account,
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.700]   but not sending the wire.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.300]   And we got an email today saying they are slowly working
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.420]   to put the money back in people's accounts,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.100]   and they don't have an ETA for when that will be done.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.060]   So as of right now, all the money in our checking account
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.820]   is inaccessible, and I'm just hoping that it comes back
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.820]   before we need to pay off our credit card bills,
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.580]   which normally happens on the 16th.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   So we've got two days.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.540]   It's gonna be an interesting 48 hours.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.100]   Hopefully that all comes through.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.260]   If not, I do have an emergency fund earning interest
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.940]   that I can draw from, but what a disaster.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.420]   However, if you would ask me last week,
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.460]   before all this happened, how long I thought it would take
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.580]   the FDIC to jump in and be able to provide a backstop
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.240]   to a bank that's going out of business,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.300]   I would have measured it in anything longer
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.660]   than one business day.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.660]   But the fact that SVB could be taken over by the FDIC
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.020]   on a Friday and by Monday, funds were made available,
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.220]   except for funds that were wired out on Friday
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.120]   and didn't go through, is pretty impressive.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.780]   So what changes am I making because of this?
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.060]   Well, I had never put more than $250,000
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.620]   into any one bank account.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.500]   So that's not a change I'm going to make,
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.520]   but you can be sure that in the future,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.780]   even though the FDIC decided to come in
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.380]   and protect depositors over the 250K limit,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.160]   I don't wanna bank on that happening again in the future.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.380]   So I absolutely will never be putting more than $250,000
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.780]   into one bank account, unless that bank
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.980]   or financial institution is working with program banks
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.140]   to spread that out.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.400]   So one of the great features
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.020]   about the Wealthfront Cash Account,
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.380]   which I've used to earn interest on cash for years,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.720]   is that there are a bunch of program banks
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.140]   to spread your money out so that you have more FDIC insurance
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.860]   than just one bank would offer.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.340]   So I think right now the limit on a single account
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.380]   is $2 million and on a joint or trust account
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.460]   is $4 million.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.840]   So that's awesome if you're looking for a place
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.740]   to earn over 4% and go over that FDIC limit.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.200]   I'm a big fan of the Wealthfront Cash Account.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.860]   Though I've actually been thinking about
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.240]   whether a high yield savings account
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.160]   is the best alternative compared to investing in treasuries.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.740]   And so I'll just segue briefly here
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.420]   because it's something I've been thinking a lot about
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.980]   and shout out to my co-founder of my last company, Chris,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.660]   who answered a few questions
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.540]   before I started recording this today.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.900]   But the main trade-off here is that you can just invest
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.540]   in US treasuries and right now, depending on the duration,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.140]   short-term treasuries are paying anywhere from 4 1/2
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.160]   to about 4.8%, changes regularly,
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.140]   so don't quote me on any of those numbers,
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.180]   which is a little higher than the 4.05%
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.980]   you get at Wealthfront or what you get
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.500]   at almost every savings account out there.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.940]   However, there's a couple added benefits
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.660]   and a few reasons not to do this.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.460]   So one, it's not the easiest process.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.660]   So if you actually truly want to go buy treasuries
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.100]   on the primary market,
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.340]   meaning buy them when they're issued,
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.700]   you need to do it on the Treasury Direct website,
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.620]   which as I've talked about in the past
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.620]   when it comes to IBONs is one of the worst websites to use.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.420]   It feels like it's more than a decade old
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.340]   and it's super clunky, but that's just one of the challenges.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.860]   The other is that if you don't hold those T-bills
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.220]   to maturity, which could be as little as four weeks,
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.600]   but could be a lot longer depending on what you decide
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.980]   to buy, you can't just easily sell them on Treasury Direct.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.940]   So unless you really know what you're doing
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.460]   and you want that experience,
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.220]   I wouldn't suggest buying them on Treasury Direct anyways.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.940]   I would probably buy those T-bills directly
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.420]   from your brokerage firm.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.540]   You could do that with Schwab, with E-Trade,
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.980]   with wherever you trade stocks and funds.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.280]   However, I still don't think that's worth it
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.880]   because the amount of work it is to manage
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.700]   and deciding whether you want to set a limit order
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.240]   because there is a spread on a lot of these securities
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.420]   is difficult.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.460]   So at the end of the day,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.860]   if you're looking to invest in treasuries to earn a yield
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.780]   that might be higher than your cash account
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.700]   or your savings account, I think the easiest way to do it
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.300]   is to just use a brokerage account
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.320]   and invest in a short-term treasury mutual fund or ETF.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.380]   My favorite is Vanguard's VUSXX.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.380]   It's their treasury money market fund,
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.140]   focuses on short-term duration.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.100]   When as of recording this, the seven-day yield was 4.57%.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.820]   But I think this is probably a good time to say why
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.960]   I think this is such a compelling option,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.080]   especially if you live in a state like California
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.680]   or New York, and that's the interest
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.120]   on government securities is state tax-free.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.360]   So if you're at the highest tax bracket in California,
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.320]   that could mean saving 13% on your earnings.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.000]   Now, other states that might be zero
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.440]   and it might not be as compelling,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.160]   but even if you find the best highest interest
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.000]   savings account out there at 5%,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.600]   it's still probably after that tax savings
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.500]   in a high tax bracket state,
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.900]   not gonna beat the current 4.5, 4.6% yield.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.620]   That said, there are expense ratios.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.180]   Right now, the expense ratio on that fund is 0.09%.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.220]   So yes, if you wanna go do all this yourself,
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.860]   you might save 0.09% if you can manage
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.700]   to price things correctly and make the right orders.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.620]   But for me, I think the best way to manage treasuries,
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.980]   and this is just my opinion,
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.740]   is through a mutual fund or an ETF.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.420]   And if I were doing an ETF,
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.640]   I think I would probably personally choose SGOV,
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.360]   which is the iShares zero to three month treasury bond ETF,
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.740]   but likely what I will use is VUSXX.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.940]   But one more important caveat is that savings accounts,
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.100]   cash accounts are a little more easily liquid.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.160]   You can withdraw money from them instantly.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.060]   You can often send wires from them.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.120]   There's no waiting for anything to close.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.960]   Whereas if you're holding a treasury mutual fund,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.760]   you're going to need to sell
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.240]   and wait for that cash to settle
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.100]   before you can transfer that money out.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.180]   So that's just an important thing.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.360]   If you want money somewhere
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.660]   where you don't need to wait two days to get it,
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.100]   a cash account or a savings account
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.900]   might be a better option.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.520]   Funny enough, if you asked me last week,
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.620]   if there were ever really a time
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.060]   where I didn't have 48 hours notice of needing cash,
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.180]   I would have told you no,
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.140]   but in the last week, the answer has actually been yes.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.980]   So I'm still going to keep a decent amount
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.860]   of very easily accessible liquid money
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.500]   in a high yield savings account,
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.860]   but for any long-term savings of cash
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.000]   for the next six, 12, 18, 24 months,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.600]   I typically keep cash for anything
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.920]   that I know I'm going to need to spend
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.680]   in the next five years.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.560]   I'm going to move that to VUSXX
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.200]   in my interactive broker's account,
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.760]   but you could just as easily do it in any brokerage account.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.040]   So for that money that I am leaving in a savings account,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.880]   I have that in my Wealthfront Cash account.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.160]   I have no worries about the security
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.240]   or safety of that money.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.520]   I know that it's spread out to multiple institutions
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.120]   under the FDIC limit.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.960]   I've watched firsthand that the FDIC
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.300]   can step in quickly to backstop things.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.320]   So I'm feeling very good and confident there.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.960]   On the investment side, I'm investing for the long run.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.240]   So none of what's happening right now has changed anything.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.640]   In fact, I don't even think I've looked
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.880]   at how my brokerage account has done in the last two weeks,
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.900]   because it's just not how I think about investing.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.860]   So nothing's really changed there.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.440]   But I did get a question from Colin,
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.280]   which was now that I stopped working at Wealthfront,
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.400]   am I still keeping my money there?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.540]   Or why wouldn't I move it to a place like Vanguard
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.360]   where I could save money on all those commissions?
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.200]   I wanted to answer that
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.880]   because it's a decision I had to make.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.120]   And right now, if you look at the portfolio I have,
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.200]   which is five or six index funds,
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.320]   I think back to my time
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.920]   before moving that money to Wealthfront
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.520]   and how slow I was to rebalance.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.400]   Because each time I needed to figure out,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.600]   okay, how much do I have to sell of this fund?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.280]   Then how much do I have to buy of this fund?
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.120]   And mix it around, like it was kind of messy.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.400]   Yes, you could probably just build a simple spreadsheet
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.000]   to do that, and I did.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.920]   But the fact that I had to log in and place those trades
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.240]   and get it all set up,
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.200]   always ended up that I kept delaying it.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.280]   And so I didn't want a system
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.520]   where I had to deal with that overhead.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.280]   But the real reason is that
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.340]   I think the automated tax loss harvesting at Wealthfront,
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.260]   in fact, I don't even think it,
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.040]   I know that it is more than paid
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.980]   for the entire fees that I've paid to Wealthfront.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.780]   Yes, you could do some of that tax loss harvesting yourself,
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.680]   but then you've got to keep track of everything,
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.400]   what's going on in different accounts.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.680]   The idea that I can put my IRAs
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.080]   and my taxable brokerage account all in one place
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.040]   that automatically trades things for tax loss harvesting,
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.640]   and ends me at the end of the year
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.400]   with a bunch of losses that I can use.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.280]   And just to be clear,
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.960]   since we haven't talked about tax loss harvesting
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.920]   in this episode, we're not talking about losing money.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.240]   I'm talking about when something is down,
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.960]   Wealthfront will sell that security
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.940]   and buy something very, very similar and correlated,
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.120]   but not identical.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.240]   So you still have the same exposure to the asset class
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.380]   that you're investing in,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.800]   but you've been able to take that loss
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.040]   while something's down,
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.400]   so you can use that to offset capital gains.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.100]   It does lower the cost basis of that investment.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.880]   So you will have to pay taxes in the future,
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.300]   but until then, you're able to capture those losses
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.720]   and reduce your taxable income.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.880]   So finally, I'm really big fan of direct indexing
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.200]   because of the impact it has on tax loss harvesting.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.960]   You could do this at other institutions,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.400]   but I haven't found one as accessible
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.240]   in terms of the number of dollars you need to have
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.360]   and the fees.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.680]   But essentially, instead of buying the S&P 500,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.920]   it buys all the individual stocks,
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.720]   which gives you the added advantage
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.240]   of being able to sell certain stocks when they're down
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.800]   and do tax loss harvesting on a stock level,
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.820]   which has also improved the ability
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.880]   to capture more losses each year.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.200]   And then finally, the portfolio line of credit feature
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.320]   at Wealthfront is great.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.640]   And I know when I was at Vanguard,
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.120]   I didn't have an option for that.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.820]   So if I need to, which actually this week
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.640]   is a prime example of this circumstance,
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.260]   I can borrow up to 30% of my portfolio
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.040]   without selling anything.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.640]   And yes, I do have to pay interest.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.840]   So there is an interest rate
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.520]   that's tied to the federal funds rate,
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.020]   which right now is higher than I'd like to pay.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.040]   But knowing that I have access to cash
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.360]   without having to sell things
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.680]   is really, really valuable to me.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.080]   So I still kept my money at Wealthfront.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.280]   I'm not planning on self-managing it.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.040]   I think the overhead that it took me
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.560]   to go manage all the trades
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.840]   and do the tax loss harvesting
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.280]   is just not even close to worth the fee.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.200]   And if you look at the Wealthfront website right now,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.480]   I think the latest data shows that on average,
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.720]   they've added an extra 1.8%
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.500]   to automated investing account clients' after-tax returns
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.360]   by turning on tax loss harvesting.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.420]   So I haven't done the math
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.360]   to see the exact value it's added to me.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.880]   I probably should, that'd be interesting.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.260]   But I remember at Wealthfront seeing this data firsthand
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.600]   and I'm a big fan.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.360]   And for the foreseeable future,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.840]   we'll be using it for all my investing.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.740]   If you wanna help me reduce my fees,
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.240]   you can go to allthehacks.com/wealthfront.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.600]   That's my referral code
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   and you'll get your first $5,000 managed free.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.760]   Back to the topic of primary checking accounts.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.800]   I don't actually know
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.680]   whether I'm going to keep the SVB account
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.760]   or transfer it somewhere else, and if so, where.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.080]   So I'll let you know if I find a new bank that I like more.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.400]   But I did get a question from Mike
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.720]   about whether checking account signup bonuses are worth it.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.200]   And it's something we haven't really talked about
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.740]   on this show, so I think now's a great time to bring it up.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.260]   There are a bunch of bonuses you can get,
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.840]   and I'm actually gonna set up a whole page
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.880]   for you to see some of them.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.440]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/bankbonus,
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.760]   I'll share a list of bonuses there.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.380]   And you'll see that there are all kinds of deals.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.260]   Everything from open up a checking account
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.440]   and get $600 to get $2,000 to get $700
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.140]   really always depends on how much money
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.240]   you're depositing in the account.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:51.160]   But in some cases, deposit 10,000, get 200.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.560]   Our au pair opened up an account at Chase,
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.160]   didn't even have to deposit that much,
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.920]   but did have to get her weekly pay deposited
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.640]   into the account and got a $300 bonus.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.680]   So I do think that in some cases,
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.280]   these bonuses are super interesting.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.680]   And I know there are people listening
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.120]   who have really gamed this system
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.600]   and opened and closed many accounts a year
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.640]   and probably earned hundreds, thousands,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.840]   maybe tens of thousands of dollars in their life
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.080]   opening up on all these bank bonuses.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.600]   So I'd love to hear from more of you
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.840]   if you've been able to do this
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.600]   and whether you think it's worth the hassle.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.440]   Generally, if I'm looking at a lot of these bonuses,
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.640]   we're talking about low hundreds of dollars
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.440]   for the effort of moving your checking relationship,
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.560]   your direct deposit, making bill pays,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.160]   sometimes even making debit card transactions
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.760]   for anywhere from three to six months
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.920]   in order to get a few hundred dollars.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.040]   Now, I don't wanna diminish the value of a few hundred
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.560]   dollars, but I also know that opening up a new credit card,
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.720]   we talked earlier in the show
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.440]   about some of the bonuses right now
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.320]   can generate over a thousand dollars at times.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.480]   So for me, I think about if I'm going to go through
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.720]   a handful of these a year, what do I wanna focus on?
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.520]   All that said, sometimes the hassle
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.360]   of moving your direct deposit over
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.000]   and making a bunch of payments
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.560]   and having to change all your bill pay
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.640]   might not be worth it for a few hundred dollars
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.360]   when you can get a multiple of that
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.000]   for just opening up a new card,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.600]   which doesn't require all that.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.160]   However, in some cases,
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.800]   you don't need to make all those changes,
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.960]   or maybe you can just split your direct deposit
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.680]   and send a few hundred dollars a month,
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.920]   not have to change all your primary bill pay
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.240]   or use the debit card, and maybe it is worth it.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.160]   I actually just opened a business checking account at Amex
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.120]   and got a 30,000 point bonus,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.080]   and I just had to make five transactions.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.880]   So I will say that there are some interesting bonuses.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.960]   Definitely check out allthehacks.com/bankbonus,
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.600]   see if there's anything there that's interesting,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.360]   and please reach out if you've been doing this
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.720]   or if you're interested in it.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.640]   I'd love to hear how that experience goes.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.800]   A few final questions before we wrap up.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.600]   So first, Alan wrote in and asked,
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.960]   "If I've looked into the commercials
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.320]   that Discover Card has been airing recently
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.440]   about how they say they'll remove your personal data
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.000]   from 10 search sites,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.040]   and was asking if it's worth all the hassle
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.600]   to get a Discover Card if he's not interested
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.520]   in spending the money for a full service like Delete Me."
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.000]   Now, Alan, I'm not sure I'm gonna give you
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.200]   an answer you like, but maybe it will be an answer you like.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.240]   So let's jump through.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.840]   First off, I went through this process a few times.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.960]   So I've now signed up for Delete Me for myself,
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.320]   I've signed up for it for my wife,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.080]   and then this year for Christmas,
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.480]   we actually bought my parents and Amy's parents
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.840]   a subscription to Delete Me for Christmas.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.280]   So I've now gone through the process
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.960]   and seen the results for six people.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.680]   And on average, each person's information
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.680]   was on anywhere from probably 20 to 45 data brokers websites.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.840]   So knowing that, if Discover's only going
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.280]   after 10 data brokers,
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.400]   I don't see how that can be a comprehensive solution.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.480]   Sure, if you're not gonna sign up for anything else
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.600]   and you already have a Discover Card,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.360]   maybe it's worth just activating it
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.800]   because it's better than nothing.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   And I'm sure they targeted 10 great data brokers,
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.880]   but I can tell you that Delete Me
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.920]   is looking at over 500 data brokers.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.920]   And so I know that it's gonna miss things
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.360]   because I know how many data brokers
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.720]   that remove data from my site.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.400]   But I wanna present a different way to think about this,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.440]   because the question was,
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.680]   is it worth signing up for a Discover Card to get this
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.200]   if you don't wanna spend the money for Delete Me?
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.320]   I'll point out that Delete Me,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.240]   after the 20% discount you get at allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.840]   is $103.20 for one year.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.120]   Now, you could open almost any credit card
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.400]   and get a signup bonus worth more than $103.20.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.960]   So if you don't think it's worth spending the money
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.920]   on Delete Me, but you are willing to open up a Discover Card
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.080]   to get this deal to help get your data removed,
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.520]   I would challenge you to open up any other card,
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.720]   get a bonus worth more than $103
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.160]   and spend that $103 on a year of Delete Me.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.280]   So I know that's not the answer you wanted
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.560]   'cause you said you don't wanna spend the money
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.760]   on Delete Me, but if you're willing to open up a credit card
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.120]   to get something, I would say instead of opening up
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.800]   a Discover Card to get a subpar version of data removal,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.240]   open up another card and allocate part of that signup bonus
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.800]   to getting something that I think
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.360]   is much more comprehensive.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.040]   And crazy enough, I just got my third report from Delete Me,
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.320]   which would be six months later.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.680]   And there is still somehow information
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.240]   on data broker websites, not just like name,
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.320]   but like actual siblings names.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.400]   I went and looked at it and it was a full set of information.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.120]   So I wish that you could just remove it once,
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.680]   but I can tell you firsthand that there are a few sites
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.040]   right now that somehow got access to the same information
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.920]   that we'd scrubbed three and six months ago.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.600]   So I'm a huge fan of the product.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.080]   Definitely think it's worth checking out.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.480]   Three other things.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.160]   One, tires.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.880]   Ashley said, "Do you have any hacks
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.480]   on getting the cheapest tires for a car
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.760]   or what is the best way to shop for tires?"
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.560]   So fortunately, I called up my brother-in-law, Jeremy,
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.760]   who owns a few tire shops.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.040]   So if you happen to be in Steamboat Springs, Colorado,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.120]   head on over to Yampa Valley Tire Pros,
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.600]   support my brother and his business.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.640]   So I wanna share a few of the things he told me.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.880]   One is that the quality of a tire really matters.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.640]   You might have to replace cheap tires two to three times
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.600]   as often as you would have to replace
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.400]   a really higher quality tire.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.800]   So definitely make sure that you're getting a good tire.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.480]   There are reports on Consumer Reports.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.520]   You can ask a local tire shop.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.560]   That's one.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.280]   Two, a lot of these tires have mileage guarantees
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.960]   and all you have to do is things like rotate your tires
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.600]   to be able to be eligible.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.560]   My brother-in-law said that these are the kind of things
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.040]   that many people don't claim,
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.080]   but actually could be really valuable.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.680]   So definitely, if you end up needing to replace tires
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.200]   before their guarantee is up,
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.120]   you can go through that process yourself
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.200]   to get those tires replaced for free.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.280]   To get the most life out of your tires,
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.840]   regularly check your alignment
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.480]   because bad alignment can wear out your tires fast.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.960]   Make sure they're properly inflated
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.280]   because even over or under inflation
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.680]   can wear out tires faster.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.440]   And then just regularly check them.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.720]   You can use a coin,
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.920]   you can use a device that you can buy online
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.680]   for a few dollars, but definitely do that.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.720]   And also if you're shopping for tires,
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.200]   there are times where there are manufacturer rebates.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.160]   And if you look online before you're ready for new tires,
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.560]   so if you're checking your tires and you're like,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.800]   we're gonna need them in the next six to seven months,
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.920]   you could basically go online in advance
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.560]   and see if there are any rebates
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.600]   and continue checking up until the time you need tires.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.840]   These rebates happen regularly enough
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.560]   that you'll probably find a good deal.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.480]   So big question is,
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.000]   one, how do you pick the best tires?
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.360]   I honestly don't have a perfect answer.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.320]   I went on Consumer Reports and the number one rated tire
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.480]   is the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.160]   So I could say, just get those tires.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.560]   They seem to be really highly rated.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.440]   They're not the most expensive tires.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   But if you want more than that,
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.960]   I'm gonna say you're gonna have to do research
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.920]   that I haven't done yet
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.560]   because I'm not in the market for tires,
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.240]   or you can go to a tire shop and ask around.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.280]   Now, a few weeks ago,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.000]   I did actually need to replace one tire on our Model 3.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.320]   And I wasn't gonna replace all my tires,
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.360]   but being the optimizer I am,
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.560]   I wanted to call around to see if I can get a better deal
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.640]   than the Tesla store,
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.880]   or maybe I could buy the tire online.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.160]   So I looked online, I thought about it.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.000]   The range to replace this tire
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.160]   was anywhere from like $370 to $410.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.680]   Keep in mind that labor rates
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.400]   are probably a lot higher in the Bay Area than anywhere else.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   But ultimately I decided that for 30 or $40 savings,
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.680]   just getting it done at the dealership for Tesla,
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.560]   knowing that if anything happens to the car,
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.480]   they're never gonna blame me for doing the tires wrong
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.160]   'cause it was their responsibility.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.000]   And they actually had the tire in stock
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.600]   and could replace it that day,
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.680]   made me much more interested in just doing that
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.000]   than trying to get a deal.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.680]   Now, if I were buying four tires and I had time to plan,
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.000]   you could buy tires at Costco or Walmart,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.840]   which my brother-in-law said both do a really good job,
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.480]   and you can ship them to yourself,
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.560]   or you can even ship them to a lot of tire stores
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.840]   and they'll put them on.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.040]   And so you might be able to save a little bit doing that
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.880]   over buying the tires from the tire shop.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.760]   However, there are a few things that I didn't think about
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.480]   that would make me want to consider
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.160]   actually buying from a tire shop in the future.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.920]   So one, guidance on which tires to get
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.600]   and how to think about those.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.360]   Two, at least my brother-in-law said
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.800]   that he manages the entire process
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.440]   for manufacturer guarantees for all of his customers
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.120]   that buy tires from him.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.320]   So if something goes wrong,
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.840]   he's gonna deal with the manufacturer,
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.240]   he's gonna get the refund, he's gonna do that.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.500]   He does free rotating, free flat repair
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.340]   for any tires purchased from him.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:22.160]   So a lot of those extra perks you'll get
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.760]   from buying from a tire shop,
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.920]   you won't get if you ship them the tires.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.720]   And so yes, you might save, you know, 20, 30 bucks per tire,
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.680]   but you gotta ask whether that's worth it.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.960]   And it really depends on the savings.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.620]   So I'll let you make that call,
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.800]   but I did wanna share some of the tips he gave
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.520]   because when Ashley wrote the question, I was like,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.360]   "On many things, I might not have a good answer,
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.400]   but at least in this case,
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.960]   I have a brother-in-law who owns a tire shop."
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.280]   So if there are other questions for him,
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.860]   let me know and I can ask.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.800]   Finally, I got another question from a reader.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.860]   "I'll keep anonymous on the off chance
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.400]   that his girlfriend is listening,
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.680]   but he said he's ready to propose to his girlfriend
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.800]   any hacks for buying an engagement ring,
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.720]   either where to look, cards to put the purchase on or what."
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.560]   And I'll share my advice
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.480]   because I went through this process with Amy years ago.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.560]   And as much as I wanted credit card points for this purchase
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.400]   because it was a large purchase,
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.660]   ultimately I found that negotiating with cash
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.820]   for things like jewelry can result in a discount
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.520]   that is much bigger than the value of the points you'll get.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.280]   So my strategy was I went into a jeweler,
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.140]   I talked, I figured out what I wanted, I got a price.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.400]   I came back in a few days, not looking too desperate
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.280]   and said, "Okay, I'll do this, but I want this price."
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.180]   I low-balled, we did a little negotiating,
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.280]   little did the jeweler know at the time,
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.480]   but I had brought all cash, like actual cash with me.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.520]   And I said, "Can you do this price?
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.680]   I can't actually remember the price
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.920]   off the top of my head now."
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.360]   And he said, "I can't do that price."
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.820]   And then I just took that much in cash,
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   put it on the table and said,
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.720]   "I will do this right now or no."
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.400]   And I think the fact that there was cash on the counter
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.000]   made him realize I was serious
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.120]   and I ended up getting a much better deal.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120]   Now, had I paid full price and put it on a card,
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.500]   I would have gotten some points,
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.120]   but those points weren't worth anywhere close
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.000]   to the discount I got paying cash.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.960]   So that said, if there is a very specific piece of jewelry
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.000]   you want and you can only get it one place
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.760]   and there's no better deal you can get paying in cash,
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.320]   or if you're trying to negotiate a deal
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.620]   on the best you can get paying in cash is 1% off,
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.220]   then yeah, I would put it on a card.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.460]   I would pick a card that gets two points per dollar,
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.160]   like the Venture or the Venture X,
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.060]   or I'd get a new card that I could hit a signup bonus on
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.980]   and get 7,500,000 points from the signup bonus.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.960]   So that's how I think about it.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.320]   That's what I got for rings.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.220]   Last question I have on the docket for today
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.300]   is around BlockFi.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.720]   As people know, I had a meaningful amount of money
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.560]   in BlockFi.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.820]   I guess I still do, or it's still somewhere.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.700]   And so Amardeep wrote out and said,
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.960]   I'd love to know if you could just give everyone an update
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.480]   on what the current status is, best you know it,
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.540]   and what people should do.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:55.860]   So for me, I got a letter from BlockFi saying,
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.400]   this is how much we believe that you have in your account
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.680]   as of the date that they decided was the date
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.120]   they're looking at balances.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.740]   If this amount is right, you don't need to do anything.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.520]   If this amount is wrong, please file a claim.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.520]   So fortunately for me, that amount was right.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.500]   So I didn't file a claim and don't feel the need to.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.200]   And now I'm just sitting back and waiting
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.080]   as they go through this bankruptcy process.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.680]   Right now, I'm pretending the money doesn't exist
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.280]   because I have no idea what will become of it.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.440]   And I would much rather be pleasantly surprised
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.840]   that I get a lot of it back than expect it to be there
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.160]   and be very sad that it won't.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.280]   So I've already kind of mourned the loss
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.160]   of the money for now.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.320]   I am optimistic that it won't be a complete zero,
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.200]   but mentally the way I like to handle these things
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.100]   is write it to zero now and get something back
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.260]   instead of assuming it'll be something.
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:49.400]   I'm hoping it'll be more than 50% of what it was,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.880]   but I have no idea if it's gonna happen this year,
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.360]   next year, or further out.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.480]   So it's a really crappy situation for a lot of people,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.940]   myself included, and I'm just hoping
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.980]   that they can figure things out quickly
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.700]   and make people as whole as possible.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.040]   I think that's it.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.900]   I covered a lot.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.300]   Obviously, if you have follow-ups,
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.680]   if you have more questions, please reach out to me.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.280]   I would love to hear from you.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.440]   I'd love to include those questions
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.760]   in the next few of these.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.420]   We're gonna do one on travel points and miles.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:21.060]   I'm gonna do one with Amy on relationships, family, and kids.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.100]   So lots of stuff to come.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.520]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.320]   Thank you for supporting me, and I'll see you next week.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.980]   (air whooshes)
