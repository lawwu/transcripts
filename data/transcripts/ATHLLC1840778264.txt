[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.460]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.460]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.240]   for another Mailbag episode,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.080]   but this time it's gonna be so much more than Q&A
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.380]   because you all have shared so much.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.680]   So we're also gonna have great deals, hacks,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.580]   and some insurance tips and wins from you all.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.240]   And as I was preparing this,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.640]   also I realized there is way too much for just one episode.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   In fact, there was way too much for two episodes.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.600]   So here's how I'm gonna break it up.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.560]   Today, I'm gonna cover all the best and latest deals,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.540]   but when it comes to hacks and questions,
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.520]   I'm gonna focus mostly on money, saving, and investing,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.640]   which includes a very timely discussion
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.160]   about how I'm thinking about banking and investing
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000]   in light of what happened last week with Silicon Valley Bank
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.800]   which, fun fact, happens to actually be our bank
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.660]   for checking and our mortgage.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.600]   So yeah, it's been an interesting last few days.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   I'm also gonna talk about where to store cash,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   bank account bonuses, shopping for tires
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.440]   or engagement rings, and a lot more.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.720]   Then I'm gonna take all the amazing travel points
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.600]   and miles, hacks, and questions
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.480]   and talk about those in a few weeks.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.520]   So feel free to send anything else over for that episode.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.640]   And then I'll take all the relationship, family,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.900]   and kids hacks and questions and do another episode,
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080]   but this time I'm gonna have my wife Amy join me
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.280]   so you can get her perspective too.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.600]   So if you have any questions you want the two of us
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.560]   to tackle, please send them our way as well.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.000]   But before we jump in, I wanna chat about a few things.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.280]   First, for everyone who had an email out to me
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.560]   that I hadn't responded to for a few weeks, I'm so sorry.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.940]   I ended up getting hundreds of listener emails
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.600]   in 2023 so far, but as of last night,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.140]   I think I've caught up on every single one of them.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.200]   So to everyone who engaged, asked questions, reached out,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.960]   thank you so much, I really appreciate your support.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.900]   Keep it coming.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.320]   And also to the 18 people
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.160]   who've joined the All The Hacks membership,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.440]   thank you so much.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   Though, however, I did get an email
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.780]   from a listener named Grace who pointed out
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.600]   that she's a bit overwhelmed by creators' memberships.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.800]   So I wanna clarify a few things.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.300]   First, my goal for the membership is to make it something
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.120]   you get way more value from than you put in.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.060]   For example, I'm trying to see if we can set up
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.800]   a travel agency and make all members sub-agents
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.720]   so you can get discounts on travel.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.460]   I'm also working on partnering with brands
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.580]   to get exclusive deals on financial and lifestyle products.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.160]   That said, I don't want it to become just a coupon book
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.200]   of things you won't use,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.140]   so I'm gonna be really thoughtful about what goes into it.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.400]   In fact, Spotify just launched a new feature
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   to ask your audience a question.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   So if you're listening there or you want to,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   you should see a pop-up.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.480]   Please let me know what perks or benefits you'd wanna see.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.680]   But like I said, I don't have those perks all yet.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.960]   Right now, the membership is really three things.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.160]   It's a monthly video call for members
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.460]   where we can discuss whatever is top of mind,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.320]   whether that's me live screen sharing,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.720]   searching for flights, giving advice on a credit card,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.040]   or giving my take on a financial question
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.760]   or decision you have to make.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.920]   Second, I wanna invite you behind the scenes
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.000]   with a podcast.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.120]   So when I book guests, I'm gonna send an email out
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.440]   to solicit questions you wanna propose I ask them
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.300]   in the interview, or I might get your take on a new idea,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.000]   like when I was considering launching
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.720]   city or country travel-focused episodes.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.280]   And third, I'm gonna flag members in my inbox
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.560]   so I can get back to you guys as fast as possible.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.120]   I still plan to reply to every email I get,
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   so it's not gonna be a gate.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.280]   Don't worry.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120]   So if that sounds like it's worth it to you,
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.860]   which right now is $10 a month or $100 a year,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'd love to have you join at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.920]   But please don't feel the pressure to join right now
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.240]   if you don't want to.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.500]   I mean, you're also welcome to join
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.040]   if you just wanna support me in the show,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.400]   but there are so many other ways you can do that
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.860]   by sharing the show with your friends or colleagues,
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.440]   leaving a rating, a review,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.800]   using the card links I have on the website,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.400]   checking out our sponsors,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.520]   or even just listening every week.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.160]   So to Grace and anyone else feeling exhausted
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.320]   with people pitching you to join their membership,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.560]   please do not feel any pressure here,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.240]   and hopefully I can add enough value to the membership
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.200]   that you wanna join and even save money each year
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.580]   by being a part.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.080]   So with that aside, we have a lot to cover,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.860]   but one quick thing, huge, huge congratulations
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.360]   to my editor, Ben, who welcomed his first child
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.840]   into the world last week.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.520]   If you notice the audio quality on this
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.480]   has dropped a little from our normal episodes,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   that's because I was doing it myself.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.360]   So as soon as Ben's back, things will get a lot better.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.540]   Let's jump in right after this.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.360]   So the first thing I wanna tackle is a follow-up
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.580]   to the episode I did a few weeks ago on insurance.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.620]   I got a few emails from listeners,
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.760]   and I just wanted to share some of the experience
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.800]   they've had and update you guys on where I ended up.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.000]   So ultimately, for some reason that I don't understand,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   we thought we were gonna go with Travelers,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.880]   but their underwriting team thought that our home,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.760]   which is not in a wildfire area,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.240]   was at too high of a risk for wildfires and said no.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.200]   So we ended up going with USAA,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.560]   which I actually anticipated being more expensive,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.780]   but it turns out that the bundled pricing
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.680]   for auto insurance at USAA
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.460]   is something they can't quote in advance
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.340]   and even mistakenly told me wouldn't exist.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.280]   But by the time I ended up getting the home policy set up
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.680]   and adding auto, the total price was less
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.280]   than it would have been with Travelers.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.440]   And the entire experience online,
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.900]   getting everything set up was so easy.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.520]   And I'm pretty excited that they're in the number one
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.560]   or number two spot on Consumer Reports.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.680]   Obviously, I haven't had any claims yet in a few days,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.700]   but I'm feeling really happy
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.400]   with the decision to move over there.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.320]   And it just feels nice
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.360]   to have all my insurance policies in one place.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.440]   One good tip, when you go to cancel insurance policies
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.980]   with your next insurance carrier,
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.320]   if you're in that situation,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.840]   they will generally, at least GEICO and Lemonade were fine,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.880]   backdating to the date that the new policy kicked in
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.360]   because at least in one case,
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.760]   it took me a few days to get things organized
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.920]   and give them a call.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.360]   So that's one thing to know.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   Also, I'm feeling good because Billy is a listener
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.640]   who reached out and said he's been a USAA member
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.040]   for 18 years.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.240]   And while his rates have gone up a little over time,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.080]   which I think is true of every carrier,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.600]   he said the service has been amazing
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.320]   and they've gone above and beyond
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.800]   and he's been so impressed.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.120]   So I'm very happy.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.680]   If anyone has any questions about my experience,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.960]   let me know, I'll update you if anything happens.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.120]   But so far, I'm very excited
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.680]   to have everything set up there.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.280]   A few other things people wrote back.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.000]   So funny enough, I got an email from John
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.720]   who said he actually was a USAA member for 20 years
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.760]   and the rates kept getting so much more expensive
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   that he ended up deciding to shop around
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.960]   and he was using PolicyGenius and had a great experience.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.760]   So if you're looking for a broker online,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.240]   John wrote in and is now saving more than $1,000 a year
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.800]   on all of his policies.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.400]   Funny enough, I think John's also in the Bay Area.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.320]   So for him, switching carriers away from USAA
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.480]   was a lot of savings.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.920]   For me, switching to USA was a lot of savings.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.720]   I think, you know, it just undermines the necessity
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.200]   for everyone to go out there and price this themselves.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.080]   So definitely recommend that.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.040]   I've used PolicyGenius in the past
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.800]   and gotten some good results,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.400]   but do keep in mind, not all carriers
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.120]   are able to price through PolicyGenius.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.440]   So for some, you're gonna need to go price on your own
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.640]   if you really wanna do an exhaustive search.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.920]   And unfortunately, it also means that
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.240]   just because I found the best rates at Travelers or USAA,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.720]   doesn't mean that even if you live
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.160]   in the same part of the country,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.480]   might have the same experience
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.000]   because it's so much driven on so many factors
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.320]   that are outside of your and my control.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.840]   When it comes to pet insurance though,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.400]   I did get two emails from Adam and Aya,
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.640]   both of which highly recommended Embrace for pet insurance.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   They both said that it was so easy to work with them.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.880]   They paid back their claims very quickly
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.240]   and they've been so happy.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.600]   Aya actually sent me her referral code
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.680]   and said if anyone listening needs pet insurance,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.240]   I really recommend Embrace
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   and here's my referral code if someone needs it.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.720]   So I'm gonna put her link in the show notes.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.000]   I'm actually gonna link allthehacks.com/embrace,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.400]   E-M-B-R-A-C-E, to Aya's referral code.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.680]   So if you wanna send her some love
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.120]   and you're looking for pet insurance,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.360]   definitely check that out.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.280]   I don't have any personal experience,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   but reading Aya and Adam's strong endorsement
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.000]   makes me think that if I'm getting pet insurance,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.640]   I don't even know if I need to look around.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.840]   I might just start there
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.200]   because they had such strong things to say.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.640]   One more thing from Jeffrey,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.120]   who, by the way, just came back from a trip to Milan
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   where he pointed out that he was able to fly in business
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.920]   for 150,000 points and some fees,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.720]   had an amazing trip to Italy,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.040]   used point.me, had a great experience,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.960]   but he said that the firm he works at
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.000]   practices in the area of significant personal injury
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.720]   and he wanted to emphasize
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.440]   how many times a catastrophic event happens
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.400]   and clients are left with almost nothing
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.760]   because the person who injured them
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.320]   was either not insured or only had the state minimums.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.560]   He said, "It is really, really important
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   "that people consider getting the maximum amount
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.680]   "of uninsured and underinsured motor as possible,
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.280]   "which in California is limited
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.920]   "to the amount you carry on your own liability."
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.600]   Jeffrey said the cost is so minimal
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.200]   and it would have made such a huge difference so many times.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.520]   So he really wanted to emphasize
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.320]   how much people should consider making sure
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.800]   they have that coverage.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.320]   Finally, I got a long email from Joel.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.480]   Thank you for everything.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.040]   Just to highlight how important disability insurance was,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.000]   he's actually had multiple people in his life,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.560]   colleagues and family members,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.760]   who have been in the unfortunate situation
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.240]   of needing to rely on their disability insurance.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.760]   And he's very thankful that the ones that had it, had it,
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.720]   and just wanted to point out that
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.640]   disabilities can be more common than people realize.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.960]   Everything from accidents, falling off a horse,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.240]   things at work that Workers' Comp doesn't cover enough of
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.680]   beyond a certain timeframe,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.560]   that he had a lot of experiences
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.160]   where people really benefited from having it
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.840]   and wanted to make sure that people had another data point
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.120]   since I personally don't have
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.320]   any of those experiences to share.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.600]   So that's a little recap from the insurance episode.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.720]   Now I wanna talk about deals
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.600]   'cause there's a handful of deals happening right now
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.680]   that I think are worth knowing about.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.160]   First, very timely because you have to book it by tomorrow,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.800]   which is March 16th.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.360]   Southwest is doing a sale 20% off all award flights.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   You have to fly by May 24th,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.160]   but the promo code is SAVE20NOW.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.920]   So if you're looking at a Southwest flight
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.480]   and you have points to do it,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.800]   you can get 20% off as long as you book today or tomorrow.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.520]   Chase Freedom, if you have a Freedom card starting today,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.320]   you can go to chasebonus.com
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.920]   and you should be able to register for the next bonus,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.880]   which for Q2 is on Amazon and Lowe's.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.080]   That's 5% cash back up to $1,500 of spend.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.640]   But if you also have a Sapphire card,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.480]   you can actually take that cash back
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.520]   and convert it to points.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.560]   So it's a great combo card.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.800]   And if you have any home improvement projects,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.480]   maybe Q2 is the time to pick stuff up at Lowe's
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.800]   and we're probably all shopping on Amazon.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.960]   So it might make sense to use your Freedom card
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.280]   if you have one for Amazon for the next three months,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.880]   starting April 1st, of course,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.160]   not three months starting now.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.400]   There are also a few card bonuses
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.720]   that are worth sharing right now
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.160]   because they are a lot higher
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.640]   than I've seen in recent past.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.400]   In fact, the Ink Business Cash and Unlimited bonuses
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.320]   are the all time best I've ever seen.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.000]   Now you might be thinking, I don't have a business,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.880]   but I wanna be clear that you probably do have a business.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.320]   Technically, if you sell something at a yard sale
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.480]   or on eBay, or you do any consulting or writing
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.760]   or handyman services or have a rental property
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.640]   or have ever driven for Lyft or done TaskRabbit,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.320]   any of those things, even if you don't have an LLC,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.520]   even if you don't have a business set up,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.680]   are still considered a sole proprietorship.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.440]   And so you can qualify for a business credit card.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.520]   In fact, when you apply for a business credit card,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.360]   you can use your name as the business name,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.040]   your address as your business address,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.720]   your phone number as your business phone number,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.280]   and your own social as the business tax ID
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.640]   because sole proprietorships
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.840]   actually don't have their own tax ID.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.600]   So you might be way more eligible for a business card
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.440]   than you think.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.200]   And right now, the Chase Ink Business Cash
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.160]   and Ink Business Unlimited both have a $900 bonus,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.960]   but like the Freedom card,
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.680]   if you have a Chase Sapphire card
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.320]   or an Ink Business Preferred,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.240]   you can use that $900 of bonus cash
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.040]   as 90,000 ultimate rewards points,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.280]   which is an awesome bonus.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.920]   Both of the cards, by the way, also have no annual fee.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.160]   So we're talking about a no annual fee card
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.680]   with a 90,000 points signup bonus,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.480]   really, really great cards.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.400]   The Business Unlimited earns 1.5% on everything,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.760]   which, like I said, if you pair with the right cards
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200]   is 1.5 points.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.960]   And the Ink Business Cash gives you 5% cash back
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.400]   or 5X points at office supply stores
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.880]   and on internet, cable, and phone services.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.440]   And you get 2% back or 2X points on gas and restaurants.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.600]   So two great opportunities.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.640]   For both of those cards,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.400]   you need to spend 6,000 in the first three months.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.440]   So I think this could be a great opportunity
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.680]   if you're eligible.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.800]   The Ink Business Preferred
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.320]   does have a 100,000 point bonus signup
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.640]   or $1,000 if you redeemed it on cash,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.720]   but you need to spend $15,000
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.960]   and there's a $95 annual fee.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.360]   So yes, it's more points,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.440]   but to get just 10,000 less points for no fee
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.040]   and not needing to spend that much
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.880]   in the first three months,
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.280]   I think it's a great opportunity.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.120]   One other thing I did read online
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.560]   is that usually you can't get a card that you already have
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.520]   and you can't qualify for the bonus
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.560]   if you've had it in the last 24 months.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.240]   But I've read a couple reports online
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.520]   that these rules don't apply to Chase Ink cards.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.720]   So some people have even been able to get a card
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.880]   for the same business that they already have
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.200]   and get the bonus.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.920]   So definitely a lot of opportunities right now.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.280]   The reason I'm talking about this now
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.840]   is that these bonuses expire March 21st.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.120]   So get in in the next week if you're interested.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.320]   I'll put the links to all these in the show notes,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.960]   or you can go to allthehacks.com/inkcash/inkunlimited
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.680]   or /inkpreferred,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.520]   or just go to allthehacks.com/cards
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.720]   and find the links there.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.360]   Few other card bonuses worth considering.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.200]   If you've been thinking about
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.960]   getting a Chase Sapphire Preferred,
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.320]   there has been a rumor posted around online
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.480]   that the bonus is going up to 80,000 points,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.480]   but you're only gonna be able to open that card
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.240]   with an offer from a branch starting on March 19th.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.360]   So if that's something you're considering,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.800]   like I always say, use the best offer you can get.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.240]   It doesn't have to be mine.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.920]   So in that case, sign up for this Chase Preferred
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   in a Chase branch if you can find a branch
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.480]   that has that offer there after March 19th.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.960]   A few other quick ones.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.440]   The Amex Gold and Platinum offers right now
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.520]   are really high for referrals.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.600]   So that's 90,000 points for Gold
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.120]   and 150,000 points for Platinum.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.880]   That means again, my links aren't gonna work,
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.400]   but I have found some referral links online.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   I can't promise how long they'll all work for,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.880]   but I'll put them in the show notes
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.960]   or at allthehacks.com/amexgold or amexplatinum.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.760]   If you have referral links yourself
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.080]   for either of those offers,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.840]   the 90,000 Gold or the 150,000 Platinum,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.400]   please feel free to send them to me
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.280]   and I'll replace those redirects
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.240]   and then links in the show notes to your offers
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.120]   because I'd love you guys to earn points.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.000]   Unfortunately, my referral bonuses
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.600]   when I log into Amex's site are much lower
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.520]   and I'd rather you guys get the most points.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.760]   So I just found some referral links online.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.960]   At the end of the day,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.440]   as much as I want you guys
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.960]   to be able to support me in the show,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.600]   I want you to get more points.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.640]   So I'm always gonna find the best links I can.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.720]   Last two other cards to consider.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.800]   One timely one is that the IHG Premier card
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   has an all time best offer of 175,000 bonus points.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.880]   The points guy values IHG points at about half a cent.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.200]   So this is about a $875 value offer, which is pretty high.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.520]   But if you are looking at doing some bookings
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.720]   at IHG properties,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.160]   you can probably make those points go a little bit further.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.560]   So something worth considering
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.920]   because this is the best offer I've ever seen on that card.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.400]   Finally, Delta launched an amazing perk
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.560]   for all of their SkyMiles cards.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.960]   And that's that you get 15% off the points you need
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.200]   for an award flight when you have a Delta card.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.120]   So for example, if you and your partner
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.680]   are looking to book a trip to Europe
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.440]   and it's gonna cost 150,000 points total,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.080]   you're actually gonna save 22,500 points for that booking
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.320]   just by holding a Delta Amex.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.920]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/cards,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.840]   you'll see all the Delta Amex cards.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.160]   They do have 70 to 90,000 point signup bonuses right now,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.240]   which is pretty decent.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   But the real big perk there is that you get 15% back.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.360]   So I'm actually considering
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.760]   getting the Delta Platinum card myself right now.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yes, it has a $250 annual fee.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.500]   However, you get 90,000 bonus miles when you get the card,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.600]   you get a free companion certificate each year,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.640]   you get that 15% off anytime you book with Delta,
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.180]   and you get your first check bag free for you
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.200]   and up to eight other people on a reservation.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.360]   All those things combined,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.520]   I think will more than make up for the $250 annual fee.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.800]   Not to mention, we've got a few trips coming up
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.220]   where I think we're gonna be flying Delta,
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.160]   so that 15% off would actually come in a lot of handy.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.520]   So that's one I'm really considering.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.040]   That's all for cards right now.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.720]   I'm hoping we get some really big, great monster bonuses
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.680]   over 100,000 later this year,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.600]   and I will be sure to tell you about them.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.680]   A few more deals.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.600]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.840]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.440]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.560]   and my info as possible.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.480]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.600]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.560]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.840]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.800]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.000]   and instead of spending 50-plus hours
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.340]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.840]   it only took a few minutes
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.920]   because I used Delete.me from Abine,
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.980]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.920]   for this episode.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.720]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.020]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.800]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.920]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.560]   and get that removed as well.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.500]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.880]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.360]   in their first two years,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.240]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.200]   for their customers.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.760]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.760]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.760]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.340]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.320]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.180]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.000]   I get it.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.700]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.580]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.660]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.580]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.540]   and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.260]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.080]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.940]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.340]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.300]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.780]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.860]   that you got through another week.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.980]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.500]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.260]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.380]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.020]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.600]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.580]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.620]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.440]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.500]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.140]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.620]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.260]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.560]   download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.580]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.520]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.740]   So first, I can't remember if I already mentioned this,
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.900]   but I don't think I'd personally signed up for it.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.820]   So now I did.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.640]   You can get Lyft Pink for free
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.940]   as a Chase Sapphire Reserve member,
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.220]   gets you some free cancellations, priority pickup,
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.700]   three scooter or e-bike passes a year,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.740]   unlimited 45-minute classic bike rides,
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.700]   as well as free Grubhub Plus for a year.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.800]   So you get two years of that
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.860]   as a Chase Sapphire Reserve member.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.080]   I'll put a link to the show notes
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.300]   where you can sign up for that.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   There's also two transfer bonuses
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.020]   to Virgin right now from Capital One and Citi.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.620]   The Citi one expires in a few days,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.180]   the Capital One at the end of the month,
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.220]   but you'll get 30% extra points transferring to Virgin.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.580]   So if there's a trip you wanna take
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.420]   and Virgin Miles are the way to do it,
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.780]   definitely worth checking that out.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.900]   I'll also link in the show notes,
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.460]   Virgin Atlantic just launched this really cool
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.720]   reward flight finder on their website,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.380]   where you can put in a Citi pair
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.100]   and it'll show you for any month when there are seats
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.140]   and how many there are in different classes.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.820]   Makes it really easy to search for availability on Virgin
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.380]   or on Delta flights to the UK.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.340]   It doesn't look like you can search for flights from the US.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.660]   So just search for London to the US.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.340]   And then as soon as you get to the search results,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.080]   you can hit return and see the other way as well.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.540]   Last set of deals.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.120]   There are a ton of offers on Amex and Chase's site
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.860]   that I think are worth considering.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.260]   And then I'll talk about why I don't actually
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.420]   have to think about a lot of them.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.240]   So on Amex, there's an offer for 10% off insurance bills
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.460]   up to $30.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.920]   Fortunately, I have a lot of insurance bills,
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.980]   so I'm gonna use that one.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.120]   If you need anything electronic that you can get from Dell
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.940]   that costs over $600, you can get $120 back.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.780]   If you are going to a Hilton resort,
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.320]   there's a $20 off $1,000.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.260]   We just did the episode on Japan
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.820]   and I saw an offer on ZipAir for $150 off $750.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.580]   So if you're looking to make a last minute trip to Japan,
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.900]   there's a great deal.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.220]   50% off Dropbox, deals on TaxAct and TurboTax,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.240]   $60 off $300 at Marriott.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.880]   And then there's a $15 off phone bill offer
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.480]   as long as your phone bill is over $115.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.920]   And I think you can use it a few times.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.760]   So those are the Amex deals.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.020]   On Chase, similarly, you can get deals
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.080]   on TurboTax and TaxAct.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.180]   My Southwest card on Chase also has a 10% off Southwest deal.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.560]   So I'm looking at a Southwest flight right now
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.320]   for later this year, so I think I'm gonna buy that soon.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.160]   And then there's a deal on Panera Bread.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.340]   And I only say Panera Bread not because I think
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.300]   everyone listening is going to Panera Bread,
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.620]   but I was with my parents
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.780]   and that's what we ended up doing for lunch.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.780]   And I didn't think to go to Chase
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.900]   before I went to Panera and add the offer.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.500]   But sure enough, I noticed that I got credit
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.220]   for a Panera Bread discount.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.660]   And that is because I signed up for Card Pointers.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.100]   And if you use Card Pointers and their browser extension,
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.060]   anytime you log into Chase or Amex's website,
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.380]   they will automatically add all these offers to your cards.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.280]   So I think three or four times now,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.440]   I've spent money at a retailer on my card
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.240]   without adding the offer,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   or at least without knowing that I added the offer,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.200]   but then I've gotten the credit back.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.960]   Amex had one where it was like $5 off restaurants
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.320]   during a certain month and it was automatically added.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.000]   So I love that Card Pointers does this,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.760]   but there's one thing that I think a lot of people
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.080]   don't realize Card Pointers does, which is even better,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.040]   which is they will simultaneously hit
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.000]   the Chase and Amex APIs and request adding those offers
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.080]   to every card at the same time,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.000]   which is important because if you've ever tried this
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.800]   yourself, you might see an offer on multiple cards,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.240]   but as soon as you add it to one,
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   it usually doesn't show up with the other cards.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.520]   But Card Pointers requests it all at the exact same time.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.680]   And so you're actually able to load those offers
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.280]   on multiple cards, which means you can redeem
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.240]   those offers multiple times.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.360]   So if you have a 10% off your insurance bill,
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.600]   up to $30 back, you could go make a $300 payment
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.960]   on every single Amex you have and get $30 for each one.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.480]   So I've gotten a ton of value out of this already,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.660]   probably more than pays for the annual fee
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.280]   if you want Card Pointers Pro.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.640]   There is a 20% discount on Card Pointers Pro
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.600]   for all the Hacks members.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.240]   Just go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.280]   and make sure you check out the extension
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.840]   if you wanna auto enroll in all these offers
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.740]   every time you log in, and I think hopefully,
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.920]   over the course of a year, I'd be surprised
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.320]   if you didn't find at least one thing
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   that you earned cash back for without even realizing it.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.960]   So that's a lot of deals right now.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   Hopefully that's helpful.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.240]   Hopefully something in there will help you save some money
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.120]   or get some extra points.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.720]   Let's jump on to hacks and questions.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.920]   But first, I just wanna share a couple wins
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.100]   because I love hearing these stories.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.040]   So when it comes to unclaimed money,
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.200]   I keep getting these amazing stories,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.400]   and I'm just gonna share them
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.640]   because a few people actually said,
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.720]   "Hey, I didn't think it was gonna work,
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.560]   "so I didn't do it.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.040]   "Finally, I did, and wow."
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.640]   I have one listener, got $93 back,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.820]   but then became obsessed with checking unclaimed money
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.320]   for their friends and family,
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.000]   and at one night, found over $1,000,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.880]   and one person had over 500 owed to them.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.560]   Then Jeff reached out and said,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.040]   "Hey, you've mentioned this a few times.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.480]   "I was super careful.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.760]   "I'm always running spreadsheets
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.040]   "to make sure I change everything.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.560]   "I didn't think it would be me.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.320]   "Finally, I added it to my list,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.000]   "and I found a $250 insurance refund,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.400]   "and then another $320 from a state
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.160]   "he and his wife used to live in."
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.680]   He said all three of those places
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.280]   should have had their updated address,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.980]   but somehow they sent the money to the state instead.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.920]   And Jeff's message to everyone listening
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.320]   is that if an ultra careful guy like him can find $600,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.120]   everyone needs to go on the hunt.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.700]   He would have bet anything that no money would be there
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.800]   when he searched, and $600 later, he was wrong.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.440]   Jeff, I'm glad you found that money.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.360]   Cameron, I'm glad you found another $80,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.800]   and then $450 for your friends.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.640]   And then Emilio, I am the most happy for you
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.400]   because he found that his undergraduate school
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.880]   where he graduated 15 years ago
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.240]   had $1,359 waiting for him
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   in his state's unclaimed money pool.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.960]   So he had to go through a little bit of hassle,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.060]   creating an account, verifying his email,
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.000]   uploading some personal documents.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.120]   But two months later,
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.800]   he got over $1,000 from the state of Virginia.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.320]   So I'll just tell everyone one more time,
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.960]   if you haven't already searched for unclaimed money,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.560]   definitely go do that, definitely worth it.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.000]   Another hack from a past episode was Michael,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.980]   who long story short, got screwed by his insurance
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.760]   and his son wasn't covered after he was born.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.800]   He had a bill of close to $7,000,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.160]   and he went back and forth,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.520]   followed some of the tips from my episode with Marshall Allen
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.600]   and got the bill down to $1,800.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.520]   Paid off 1,000, still owed 800,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.080]   and asked them if he paid 500,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.960]   would they call it even?
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.120]   And they said, yes.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.100]   So it just goes to show,
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.680]   yes, insurance would have been great,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.160]   but if you're in a situation where you have a medical bill,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.680]   please make sure you fight back and negotiate.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.120]   Go back and listen to episode 34 of "All The Hacks"
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.640]   if you need some tips,
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.680]   but there's always a way to get that price down.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.880]   And finally, had an awesome Apple review
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.320]   from a listener, Fit Gravity,
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.400]   who said, love the show.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.200]   I'm so glad I discovered this podcast.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.680]   Love the content, the topics,
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.760]   and getting real practical tips.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.720]   I just saved $260 on the purchase of a washer and dryer
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.160]   from Home Depot using a hack I learned on the show
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.320]   that I wanna share.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.840]   I was about to buy a 15% off coupon from Save N Deals,
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.240]   which is a site I've shared before
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.760]   that I'll put in the show notes,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.560]   but then they realized it couldn't be applied
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.160]   to a purchase on sale.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.080]   So they quickly chatted with customer support,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.240]   and boom, they were offered a discount
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.120]   that was actually eligible for the sale price already,
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.400]   and finally made the purchase
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.880]   through the Capital One Shopping Portal
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.400]   with a 5% cashback offer from Home Depot
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.680]   to sweeten the deal.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.560]   That is so awesome.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.760]   I love stumbling upon stories like this in reviews.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.160]   And speaking of them, I'm at 904 reviews on Apple Podcasts,
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.040]   and I have a goal to get to 1,000.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.560]   So any help would be greatly appreciated.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.940]   Thank you so much.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.940]   Okay, I keep saying we're gonna get to hacks,
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.780]   and here we are.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.520]   I wanna share a bunch of awesome hacks
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.680]   that I've learned from you all that you've sent in,
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.560]   and then I wanna answer a bunch of questions
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.700]   and come back to the big elephant in the room,
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.160]   which is how am I rethinking about money
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.640]   now that my primary bank has more or less collapsed,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.920]   although maybe not, but I'll get to that.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.680]   But here are some hacks that I wanna share.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.440]   First from Ben.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.720]   He started off sharing a hack
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.940]   that I think I've shared before,
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.880]   which is that if you wanna make large purchases,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.160]   you can always take a card
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.400]   that gets you a bonus at the grocery store
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.240]   and buy gift cards.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.680]   But he pointed out that if you're going to Kroger,
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.320]   and oftentimes this is also true in Safeway,
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.960]   if you use their app,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.880]   you can activate bonus points for fuel.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   Every time he's had these big purchases,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.320]   he buys gift cards, activates the Forex fuel points,
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.080]   and has been doing this a lot.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.400]   Funny enough, he doesn't even have a car that uses gas,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   but he keeps adding these deals
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.240]   to his father-in-law's account.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.160]   And he said his father-in-law has been tracking
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.260]   the amount he's saved filling his car with diesel gas,
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.320]   and last year he saved over $1,000.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.040]   So this is probably true
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.600]   even if you're just buying groceries,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.160]   but don't forget to use that grocery app
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.600]   to add fuel points if you're making purchases,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.880]   but also don't forget to add the deals.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.320]   Every time I'm going to Safeway,
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.720]   I look in the Safeway app,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.880]   and they have deals that you don't see in the store always
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.240]   that are so much better.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.880]   Just yesterday, I added a $5 off coupon.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.920]   In the past, I've added a free gallon of milk,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.320]   a free carton of eggs, $1 strawberries,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.700]   a free avocado, all kinds of stuff.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.720]   So definitely recommend checking out the grocery store apps
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.860]   because there's some deals in there that are awesome.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.600]   When it comes to renting a car,
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.120]   Ed wanted to share that as much as it might seem ridiculous,
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.720]   if rental cars are expensive,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.000]   don't forget to look at U-Haul.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.080]   He said, yes, it might've been inconvenient,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.120]   but he has definitely rented a 10-foot box truck in the past
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.700]   because rental cars were more expensive.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.120]   So Ed, great tip.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.320]   Now I want to share another hack
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   for getting a deal on phones.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.600]   Two things, one's mine and one's from Phaedra.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   So Phaedra pointed out that every now and then,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.820]   AT&T and Verizon have really, really high values
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.060]   on trade-ins.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.500]   So she was able to get $1,000 off a new iPhone
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.960]   by trading in any phone on a list of approved devices.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.140]   One of those was a Samsung S20
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.580]   that she went on Craigslist and bought for $300
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.220]   and got the full $1,000 trade-in value.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.940]   So anytime these carriers are running these deals
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.560]   for huge discounts, if you trade in your phone,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.240]   even if you don't have an eligible phone,
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.300]   definitely go search for it.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.400]   There's another discount that often happens
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.060]   where you get a huge discount
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.380]   for porting a number into your line.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.620]   But it's not just adding a new line.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.420]   The discount comes if you port the number
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.740]   from another carrier.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.980]   Now, recently I learned that the hack for this
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.020]   is a website called Phone Barn
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.220]   where you can actually buy phone numbers
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.580]   and port them over.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.780]   So for a few dollars, you can buy a phone number,
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.300]   port it over, and oftentimes get huge savings
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.340]   on a new phone by porting a phone number
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.660]   over from somewhere else.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.900]   Definitely something to work out.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.560]   You can even check the eligibility
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.200]   of the number usually before you buy it.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.720]   Next, concerts.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.360]   On Twitter, SoiHenry shared that his favorite hack
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.400]   is buying tickets minutes before
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.480]   or even after an event has started.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.040]   He said people end up panic selling
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.800]   and there's great opportunities.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.080]   This is something I've used a lot in New York
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.920]   for going to Broadway shows.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.800]   There used to be a FedEx office store,
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.520]   or maybe it was FedEx Kinko's back then,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.900]   around Times Square.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.720]   So if we wanted to go to a Broadway show
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.360]   and we looked like there were a lot of tickets on StubHub,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.980]   we would just go a few minutes before
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.500]   and wait and wait and wait for the price to drop
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.420]   because people were quickly dropping them
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.640]   so that they could get sold and not go lost.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.580]   Back before you could necessarily do them all on mobile,
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.580]   we would just walk into the FedEx store,
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.380]   we would print out the tickets and walk into the show
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.540]   having just bought them a few minutes before.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.660]   So that's definitely an awesome hack.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   Another one that Sean's shared
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.220]   is that he uses the Amex emails
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.060]   on early access to concert tickets all the time.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.740]   And his Amex Platinum got him face value early access
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.760]   to Sixth Row Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.760]   before they went on sale to the general public.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.480]   So there are a few hacks for concerts.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.460]   This is a little one, but I really liked it.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.080]   Nirav pointed out that if you're using any apps
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.400]   that can let you reassign keys,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.680]   the Karabiner app on Mac is one of them.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.360]   He loves reassigning the caps lock key.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.620]   And I'm always thinking about keyboard shortcuts
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.620]   and trying to come up with something really obscure
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.560]   that isn't being used.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.880]   But I never really thought about the fact
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.660]   that I never use caps lock.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.700]   So you've got this big key on your keyboard.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.320]   If you can use an app like Karabiner to remap it,
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.040]   then you're able to do a lot of cool stuff.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.600]   So he remaps it to actually be the equivalent of F13,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.680]   which is not a real key in Karabiner.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.180]   And then he can use that to trigger
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.680]   a lot of other things on his computer.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.280]   Two more, one from Suheitha.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.580]   I think you've all heard me talk about
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.660]   how much I love the app Paprika for managing recipes,
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.260]   but it can get a little expensive
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.680]   and they charge for every single platform.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.000]   And so she pointed out that Crouton is a similar app
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.400]   that's less expensive.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.160]   I actually downloaded it today
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.000]   and started importing recipes and I was pretty impressed.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.880]   They have a Mac app and an iPhone app.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   It was really simple, really nice.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.640]   If I didn't already pay for Paprika,
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.840]   I would definitely consider it
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.920]   because I think if you purchase it within the first 24 hours
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.060]   it's just $10 across all platforms.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.180]   So if you're looking for a recipe and meal planning app
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.840]   and Paprika was too expensive, check out Crouton.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   And finally, a big shout out to Mindy
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.960]   from BiggerPocketsMoney who said
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.520]   that she has a great hack for Target
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.800]   that works at lots of different places.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.200]   When they have a sale on car seats,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.880]   which happens a couple of times a year,
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.200]   they often give 20% additional off
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.340]   if you bring in a used car seat.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.880]   She said, even if you don't have a used car seat,
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.360]   you can typically find them really, really affordably
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.760]   or free on Craigslist, Freecycle,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.280]   Buy Nothing groups or anything.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.680]   Target will dispose of them anyway,
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.520]   so it doesn't matter what the condition is,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.340]   but you can get an extra 20% off there.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.840]   So another great tip there, love that one.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.080]   Thank you for sending all these great hacks in.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.400]   I'm gonna keep sharing them.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.000]   I've got a bunch from travel that I'm excited to share
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.940]   in the next time we do this episode,
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.600]   but please keep sending them in
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.840]   and let's jump in to questions.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.720]   So Jessica wrote in asking for my thoughts on SVB
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.280]   and boy, do I have some.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.860]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.360]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.960]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.620]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.000]   as you build your wealth.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.280]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.120]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.280]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.800]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.200]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.160]   I've loved being a part of the community
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.480]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.600]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.960]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.680]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.480]   are first generation wealth,
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.560]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.700]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.040]   and learn from each other
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.640]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.920]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.260]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.680]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.840]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.800]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.280]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.720]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.080]   to your children's education,
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.380]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.840]   So many of these conversations
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.060]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.720]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.560]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.760]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.820]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.960]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.480]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.420]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.500]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.420]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.980]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.580]   And I am so excited to be partnering
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.940]   with them for this episode.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.140]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.820]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.360]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.140]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.240]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.060]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.780]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.340]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.820]   And it's not just for men.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.240]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.880]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.320]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.820]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.880]   I've ever owned.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.680]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.760]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.680]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.840]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.080]   Or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.040]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.360]   And for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.840]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.920]   So definitely check them out at allthehacks.com/viore.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.680]   And get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.600]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.320]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.600]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.440]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.160]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.920]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.480]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.640]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.080]   She wanted to know how to proceed
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.760]   as it relates to everything she's doing
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.360]   with her personal finances.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.240]   She actually had some questions
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.840]   about Wealthfront and BlockFi, so I'll get to all of it.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.680]   But first off, I will say that the way everything unfolded
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.760]   with SVB, while slightly terrifying,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.760]   ended up in a place that I'm feeling a lot more confident
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.080]   with what FDIC insurance actually means.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.600]   I think I was a little stressed out
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.000]   because we just didn't have access to any of our money.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.680]   And in fact, as of recording this on Tuesday night,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.120]   I still don't, because we tried to wire our money
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.280]   out of SVB, not knowing the future.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.000]   They ended up debiting all the money out of our account,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.640]   but not sending the wire.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.240]   And we got an email today saying they are slowly working
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.360]   to put the money back in people's accounts,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.040]   and they don't have an ETA for when that will be done.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.000]   So as of right now, all the money
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.360]   in our checking account is inaccessible,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.760]   and I'm just hoping that it comes back
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   before we need to pay off our credit card bills,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.520]   which normally happens on the 16th.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.520]   So we've got two days.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.480]   It's gonna be an interesting 48 hours.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.080]   Hopefully that all comes through.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.240]   If not, I do have an emergency fund earning interest
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.920]   that I can draw from, but what a disaster.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.400]   However, if you would ask me last week,
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.480]   before all this happened, how long I thought
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.360]   it would take the FDIC to jump in
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.560]   and be able to provide a backstop
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.240]   to a bank that's going out of business,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.280]   I would have measured it in anything longer
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.680]   than one business day.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.800]   But the fact that SVB could be taken over
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.400]   by the FDIC on a Friday, and by Monday,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.840]   funds were made available, except for funds
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.200]   that were wired out on Friday and didn't go through,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.120]   is pretty impressive.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.760]   So what changes am I making because of this?
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.040]   Well, I had never put more than $250,000
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.600]   into any one bank account.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.480]   So that's not a change I'm going to make,
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.520]   but you can be sure that in the future,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.760]   even though the FDIC decided to come in
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.360]   and protect depositors over the 250K limit,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.120]   I don't wanna bank on that happening again in the future.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.880]   So I absolutely will never be putting
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.640]   more than $250,000 into one bank account,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.120]   unless that bank or financial institution
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.080]   is working with program banks to spread that out.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.360]   So one of the great features
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.000]   about the Wealthfront Cash Account,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.360]   which I've used to earn interest on cash for years,
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.680]   is that there are a bunch of program banks
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.640]   to spread your money out so that you have
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.800]   more FDIC insurance than just one bank would offer.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.280]   So I think right now the limit on a single account
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.320]   is $2 million and on a joint or trust account
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.400]   is $4 million.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.760]   So that's awesome if you're looking for a place
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.680]   to earn over 4% and go over that FDIC limit,
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.120]   I'm a big fan of the Wealthfront Cash Account.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.800]   Though I've actually been thinking about
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.160]   whether a high yield savings account
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.080]   is the best alternative compared to investing in treasuries.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.680]   And so I'll just segue briefly here
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.360]   because it's something I've been thinking a lot about
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.920]   and shout out to my co-founder of my last company, Chris,
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.600]   who answered a few questions
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.480]   before I started recording this today.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.520]   But the main trade-off here
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.080]   is that you can just invest in US treasuries.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.480]   And right now, depending on the duration,
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.920]   short-term treasuries are paying
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.120]   anywhere from four and a half to about 4.8%.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.720]   Changes regularly, so don't quote me
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.080]   on any of those numbers,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.120]   which is a little higher than the 4.05%
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.400]   that you get at Wealthfront
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.520]   or what you get at almost every savings account out there.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.920]   However, there's a couple added benefits
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.640]   and a few reasons not to do this.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.480]   So one, it's not the easiest process.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.680]   So if you actually truly want to go buy treasuries
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.120]   on the primary market,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.360]   meaning buy them when they're issued,
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.720]   you need to do it on the Treasury Direct website,
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.640]   which as I've talked about in the past
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   when it comes to IBONs is one of the worst websites to use.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.440]   It feels like it's more than a decade old
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.080]   and it's super clunky,
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.320]   but that's just one of the challenges.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.840]   The other is that if you don't hold those T-bills
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.200]   to maturity, which could be as little as four weeks,
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.400]   but could be a lot longer
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.240]   depending on what you decide to buy,
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.960]   you can't just easily sell them on Treasury Direct.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.920]   So unless you really know what you're doing
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.440]   and you want that experience,
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.200]   I wouldn't suggest buying them on Treasury Direct anyways.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.920]   I would probably buy those T-bills directly
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.400]   from your brokerage firm.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.520]   You could do that with Schwab, with E-Trade,
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.960]   with wherever you trade stocks and funds.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.240]   However, I still don't think that's worth it
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.880]   because the amount of work it is to manage
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.680]   and deciding whether you wanna set a limit order
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.760]   because there is a spread
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.360]   on a lot of these securities is difficult.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.400]   So at the end of the day,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.800]   if you're looking to invest in treasuries to earn a yield
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.720]   that might be higher than your cash account
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.320]   or your savings account,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.640]   I think the easiest way to do it
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.240]   is to just use a brokerage account
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   and invest in a short-term treasury mutual fund or ETF.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.400]   My favorite is Vanguard's VUSXX.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   It's their treasury money market fund,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.160]   focuses on short-term duration.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.400]   When I was recording this,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.120]   the seven-day yield was 4.57%.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.840]   But I think this is probably a good time to say why
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.000]   I think this is such a compelling option,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.880]   especially if you live in a state like California or New York
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.080]   and that's the interest on government securities
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.160]   is state tax-free.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.400]   So if you're at the highest tax bracket in California,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.360]   that could mean saving 13% on your earnings.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.000]   Now, other states that might be zero
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.480]   and it might not be as compelling,
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.800]   but even if you find the best,
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.000]   highest interest savings account out there at 5%,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.600]   it's still probably after that tax savings
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.520]   in a high tax bracket state,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.920]   not gonna beat the current 4.5, 4.6% yield.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.640]   That said, there are expense ratios.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.200]   Right now, the expense ratio on that fund is 0.09%.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.240]   So yes, if you wanna go do all this yourself,
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.880]   you might save 0.09% if you can manage
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.720]   to price things correctly and make the right orders.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.600]   But for me, I think the best way to manage treasuries,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.000]   and this is just my opinion,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.720]   is through a mutual fund or an ETF.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.440]   And if I were doing an ETF,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.640]   I think I would probably personally choose SGOV,
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.360]   which is the iShares zero to three-month treasury bond ETF,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.720]   but likely what I will use is VUSXX.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.920]   But one more important caveat is that savings accounts,
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.080]   cash accounts are a little more easily liquid.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.160]   You can withdraw money from them instantly.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.040]   You can often send wires from them.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.120]   There's no waiting for anything to close.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.960]   Whereas if you're holding a treasury mutual fund,
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.240]   you're going to need to sell and wait for that cash to settle
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.080]   before you can transfer that money out.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.160]   So that's just an important thing.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.360]   If you want money somewhere
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.640]   where you don't need to wait two days to get it,
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.880]   a cash account or a savings account might be a better option.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.520]   Funny enough, if you asked me last week
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.600]   if there were ever really a time
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.040]   where I didn't have 48 hours notice of needing cash,
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.160]   I would have told you no.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.120]   But in the last week, the answer has actually been yes.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.960]   So I'm still going to keep a decent amount
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.840]   of very easily accessible liquid money
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.480]   in a high-yield savings account.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.840]   But for any long-term savings of cash
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.880]   for the next six, 12, 18, 24 months,
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.160]   you know, I typically keep cash
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.920]   for anything that I know I'm going to need to spend
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.680]   in the next five years.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.560]   I'm going to move that to VUSXX
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.200]   in my interactive broker's account,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.760]   but you could just as easily do it in any brokerage account.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.040]   So for that money that I am leaving in a savings account,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.880]   I have that in my Wealthfront Cash account.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.240]   I have no worries about the security or safety of that money.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.520]   I know that it's spread out to multiple institutions
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.120]   under the FDIC limit.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.960]   I've watched firsthand that the FDIC
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.320]   can step in quickly to backstop things.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.360]   So I'm feeling very good and confident there.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.000]   On the investment side, I'm investing for the long run.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.280]   So none of what's happening right now has changed anything.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.680]   In fact, I don't even think I've looked
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.880]   at how my brokerage account has done in the last two weeks
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.920]   because it's just not how I think about investing.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.880]   So nothing's really changed there.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.480]   But I did get a question from Colin,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.280]   which was now that I stopped working at Wealthfront,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.400]   am I still keeping my money there?
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.560]   Or why wouldn't I move it to a place like Vanguard
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.400]   where I could save money on all those commissions?
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.240]   I wanted to answer that
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.880]   because it's a decision I had to make.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.120]   And right now, if you look at the portfolio I have,
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.180]   which is five or six index funds,
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.320]   I think back to my time
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.920]   before moving that money to Wealthfront
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.520]   and how slow I was to rebalance
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.400]   because each time I needed to figure out,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.600]   okay, how much do I have to sell of this fund?
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.280]   Then how much do I have to buy of this fund
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.160]   and mix it around?
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.120]   Like it was kind of messy.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.400]   Yes, you could probably just build a simple spreadsheet
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.980]   to do that, and I did.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.760]   But the fact that I had to log in
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.200]   and place those trades and get it all set up
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.160]   always ended up that I kept delaying it.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.240]   And so I didn't want a system
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.480]   where I had to deal with that overhead.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.840]   But the real reason is that I think
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.320]   the automated tax loss harvesting at Wealthfront,
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.240]   in fact, I don't even think it,
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.040]   I know that it is more than paid
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.960]   for the entire fees that I've paid to Wealthfront.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.760]   Yes, you could do some of that tax loss harvesting yourself,
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.680]   but then you've got to keep track of everything,
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.400]   what's going on in different accounts.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.680]   The idea that I can put my IRAs
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.080]   and my taxable brokerage account all in one place
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:33.040]   that automatically trades things for tax loss harvesting
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.660]   and ends me at the end of the year
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.440]   with a bunch of losses that I can use.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.280]   And just to be clear,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.000]   since we haven't talked about tax loss harvesting
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.960]   in this episode, we're not talking about losing money.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.280]   I'm talking about when something is down,
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.000]   Wealthfront will sell that security
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.960]   and buy something very, very similar and correlated,
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.160]   but not identical.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.280]   So you still have the same exposure to the asset class
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.400]   that you're investing in,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.840]   but you've been able to take that loss
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.080]   while something's down,
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.440]   so you can use that to offset capital gains.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.120]   It does lower the cost basis of that investment.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.920]   So you will have to pay taxes in the future,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.320]   but until then, you're able to capture those losses
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.760]   and reduce your taxable income.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.920]   So finally, I'm really big fan of direct indexing
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.220]   because of the impact it has on tax loss harvesting.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.000]   You could do this at other institutions,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.440]   but I haven't found one as accessible
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.280]   in terms of the number of dollars you need to have
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.400]   and the fees.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.720]   But essentially, instead of buying the S&P 500,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.960]   it buys all the individual stocks,
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.760]   which gives you the added advantage
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.260]   of being able to sell certain stocks when they're down
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.840]   and do tax loss harvesting on a stock level,
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   which has also improved the ability
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.920]   to capture more losses each year.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.240]   And then finally, the portfolio line of credit feature
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.360]   at Wealthfront is great.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.680]   And I know when I was at Vanguard,
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.160]   I didn't have an option for that.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.720]   So if I need to,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.200]   which actually this week is a prime example
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.660]   of this circumstance,
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.280]   I can borrow up to 30% of my portfolio
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.080]   without selling anything.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.680]   And yes, I do have to pay interest.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.880]   So there is an interest rate
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.560]   that's tied to the federal funds rate,
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.060]   which right now is higher than I'd like to pay,
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.080]   but knowing that I have access to cash
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.400]   without having to sell things
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.720]   is really, really valuable to me.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.120]   So I still kept my money at Wealthfront.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.320]   I'm not planning on self-managing it.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.080]   I think the overhead that it took me
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.600]   to go manage all the trades
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.860]   and do the tax loss harvesting
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.300]   is just not even close to worth the fee.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.220]   And if you look at the Wealthfront website right now,
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.500]   I think the latest data shows that on average,
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.760]   they've added an extra 1.8%
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.540]   to automated investing account clients' after-tax returns
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.380]   by turning on tax loss harvesting.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.520]   So I haven't done the math to see the exact value
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.400]   it's added to me.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.920]   I probably should, that'd be interesting.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.280]   But I remember at Wealthfront seeing this data firsthand
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.640]   and I'm a big fan.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.400]   And for the foreseeable future,
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.880]   we'll be using it for all my investing.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.760]   If you wanna help me reduce my fees,
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.240]   you can go to allthehacks.com/wealthfront.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.640]   That's my referral code
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.400]   and you'll get your first $5,000 managed free.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.780]   Back to the topic of primary checking accounts.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.840]   I don't actually know
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.680]   whether I'm going to keep the SVB account
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.800]   or transfer it somewhere else, and if so, where.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.120]   So I'll let you know if I find a new bank that I like more.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.400]   But I did get a question from Mike
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.720]   about whether checking account signup bonuses are worth it.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.240]   And it's something we haven't really talked about
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.760]   on this show, so I think now's a great time to bring it up.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.280]   There are a bunch of bonuses you can get
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.880]   and I'm actually gonna set up a whole page
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.900]   for you to see some of them.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.480]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/bankbonus,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.800]   I'll share a list of bonuses there.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.400]   And you'll see that there are all kinds of deals,
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.300]   everything from open up a checking account
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.480]   and get $600 to get $2,000 to get $700,
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.200]   really always depends on how much money
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.280]   you're depositing in the account.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.200]   But in some cases, deposit 10,000, get 200.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.600]   Our au pair opened up an account at Chase,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.200]   didn't even have to deposit that much,
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.960]   but did have to get her weekly pay deposited
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.660]   into the account and got a $300 bonus.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.720]   So I do think that in some cases,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.300]   these bonuses are super interesting.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.720]   And I know there are people listening
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.160]   who have really gamed this system
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.640]   and opened and closed many accounts a year
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.680]   and probably earned hundreds, thousands,
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.880]   maybe tens of thousands of dollars in their life
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.100]   opening up on all these bank bonuses.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.600]   So I'd love to hear from more of you
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.880]   if you've been able to do this
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.600]   and whether you think it's worth the hassle.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.480]   Generally, if I'm looking at a lot of these bonuses,
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.660]   we're talking about low hundreds of dollars
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.480]   for the effort of moving your checking relationship,
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.560]   your direct deposit, making bill pays,
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.180]   sometimes even making debit card transactions
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.800]   for anywhere from three to six months
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.920]   in order to get a few hundred dollars.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.480]   Now, I don't wanna diminish the value of a few hundred dollars
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.600]   but I also know that opening up a new credit card,
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.720]   we talked earlier in the show
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.480]   about some of the bonuses right now
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.360]   can generate over $1,000 at times.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.940]   So for me, I think about
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.160]   if I'm going to go through a handful of these a year,
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.760]   what do I wanna focus on?
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.540]   All that said, sometimes the hassle
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.360]   of moving your direct deposit over
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.000]   and making a bunch of payments
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.600]   and having to change all your bill pay
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.640]   might not be worth it for a few hundred dollars
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.400]   when you can get a multiple of that
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.020]   for just opening up a new card,
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.600]   which doesn't require all that.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.160]   However, in some cases,
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.840]   you don't need to make all those changes
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.000]   or maybe you can just split your direct deposit
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.720]   and send a few hundred dollars a month,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.920]   not have to change all your primary bill pay
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.280]   or use the debit card and maybe it is worth it.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.160]   I actually just opened a business checking account at Amex
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.160]   and got a 30,000 point bonus
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.120]   and I just had to make five transactions.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.920]   So I will say that there are some interesting bonuses
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.000]   definitely check out allthehacks.com/bankbonus,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.620]   see if there's anything there that's interesting
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.400]   and please reach out if you've been doing this
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.760]   or if you're interested in it.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.680]   I'd love to hear how that experience goes.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.840]   A few final questions before we wrap up.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.640]   So first, Allen wrote in and asked,
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.020]   if I've looked into the commercials
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.360]   that Discover Card has been airing recently
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.480]   about how they say they'll remove your personal data
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.040]   from 10 search sites
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.080]   and was asking if it's worth all the hassle
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.700]   to get a Discover Card,
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.520]   if he's not interested in spending the money
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.580]   for a full service like Delete Me.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.040]   Now, Allen, I'm not sure I'm gonna give you
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.260]   an answer you like, but maybe it will be an answer you like.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.280]   So let's jump through.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.900]   First off, I went through this process a few times.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.040]   So I've now signed up for Delete Me for myself,
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.360]   I've signed up for it for my wife
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.120]   and then this year for Christmas,
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:16.520]   we actually bought my parents and Amy's parents
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.880]   a subscription to Delete Me for Christmas.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.320]   So I've now gone through the process
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.000]   and seen the results for six people.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.720]   And on average, each person's information
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   was on anywhere from probably 20 to 45 data brokers websites.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.860]   So knowing that, if Discover's only going
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.300]   after 10 data brokers,
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.420]   I don't see how that can be a comprehensive solution.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.500]   Sure, if you're not gonna sign up for anything else
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.620]   and you already have a Discover Card,
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.400]   maybe it's worth just activating it
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.820]   because it's better than nothing.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.820]   And I'm sure they targeted 10 great data brokers,
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:49.900]   but I can tell you that Delete Me
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.960]   is looking at over 500 data brokers.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.940]   And so I know that it's gonna miss things
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.380]   because I know how many data brokers
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.740]   that remove data from my site.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.440]   But I wanna present a different way to think about this
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.460]   because the question was,
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.700]   is it worth signing up for a Discover Card to get this
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.220]   if you don't wanna spend the money for Delete Me?
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.380]   I'll point out that Delete Me
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.140]   after the 20% discount you get
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.900]   at allthehacks.com/deleteme is $103.20 for one year.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.180]   Now, you could open almost any credit card
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:20.460]   and get a signup bonus worth more than $103.20.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.000]   So if you don't think it's worth spending the money
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.960]   on Delete Me, but you are willing to open up a Discover Card
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.140]   to get this deal to help get your data removed,
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.580]   I would challenge you to open up any other card,
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.780]   get a bonus worth more than $103
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.200]   and spend that $103 on a year of Delete Me.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.340]   So I know that's not the answer you wanted
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.140]   'cause you said you don't wanna spend the money on Delete Me,
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.820]   but if you're willing to open up a credit card
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.180]   to get something, I would say,
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.260]   instead of opening up a Discover Card
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.860]   to get a subpar version of data removal,
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:54.300]   open up another card and allocate part of that signup bonus
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:58.400]   to getting something that I think is much more comprehensive.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.080]   And crazy enough, I just got my third report from Delete Me,
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.360]   which would be six months later.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.720]   And there is still somehow information
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.280]   on data broker websites, not just like name,
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.360]   but like actual siblings' names.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.680]   I went and looked at it
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.440]   and it was a full set of information.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.160]   So I wish that you could just remove it once,
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.580]   but I can tell you firsthand
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.240]   that there are a few sites right now
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.080]   that somehow got access to the same information
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.960]   that we'd scrubbed three and six months ago.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.640]   So I'm a huge fan of the product.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.140]   Definitely think it's worth checking out.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.540]   Three other things.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.200]   One, tires.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.840]   Ashley said, "Do you have any hacks
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.440]   "on getting the cheapest tires for a car?
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.800]   "Or what is the best way to shop for tires?"
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.600]   So fortunately, I called up my brother-in-law, Jeremy,
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.800]   who owns a few tire shops.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.060]   So if you happen to be in Steamboat Springs, Colorado,
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.160]   head on over to Yampa Valley Tire Pros,
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.660]   support my brother and his business.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.680]   So I wanna share a few of the things he told me.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.920]   One is that the quality of a tire really matters.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.680]   You might have to replace cheap tires
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.440]   two to three times as often
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   as you would have to replace a really higher quality tire.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.840]   So definitely make sure that you're getting a good tire.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.560]   There are reports on Consumer Reports.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.580]   You can ask a local tire shop.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.640]   That's one.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.360]   Two, a lot of these tires have mileage guarantees
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.000]   and all you have to do is things like rotate your tires
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.640]   to be able to be eligible.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   My brother-in-law said that these are the kind of things
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.120]   that many people don't claim,
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.160]   but actually could be really valuable.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.720]   So definitely, if you end up needing to replace tires
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.240]   before their guarantee is up,
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.160]   you can go through that process yourself
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.240]   to get those tires replaced for free.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.320]   To get the most life out of your tires,
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.860]   regularly check your alignment
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.480]   because bad alignment can wear out your tires fast.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.960]   Make sure they're properly inflated
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.300]   because even over or under inflation
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.760]   can wear out tires faster.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.480]   And then just regularly check them.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.760]   You can use a coin.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.940]   You can use a device that you can buy online
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.720]   for a few dollars, but definitely do that.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.740]   And also if you're shopping for tires,
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.240]   there are times where there are manufacturer rebates.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.200]   And if you look online before you're ready for new tires,
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.600]   so if you're checking your tires and you're like,
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.800]   we're gonna need them in the next six to seven months,
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.920]   you could basically go online in advance
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.560]   and see if there are any rebates
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.640]   and continue checking up until the time you need tires.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.840]   These rebates happen regularly enough
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.560]   that you'll probably find a good deal.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   So big question is one, how do you pick the best tires?
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.360]   I honestly don't have a perfect answer.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.320]   I went on Consumer Reports and the number one rated tire
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.520]   is the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.180]   So I could say, just get those tires.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.560]   They seem to be really highly rated.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.440]   They're not the most expensive tires,
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.460]   but if you want more than that,
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.000]   I'm gonna say you're gonna have to do research
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.960]   that I haven't done yet
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.560]   because I'm not in the market for tires,
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.280]   or you can go to a tire shop and ask around.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.300]   Now, a few weeks ago,
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:43.020]   I did actually need to replace one tire on our Model 3.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.360]   And I wasn't gonna replace all my tires,
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.380]   but being the optimizer I am,
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.440]   I wanted to call around
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.680]   to see if I can get a better deal than the Tesla store,
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.920]   or maybe I could buy the tire online.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.200]   So I looked online, I thought about it.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.020]   The range to replace this tire
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:01.160]   was anywhere from like $370 to $410.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.680]   Keep in mind that labor rates
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.440]   are probably a lot higher in the Bay Area than anywhere else.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:10.440]   But ultimately, I decided that for 30 or $40 savings,
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.700]   just getting it done at the dealership for Tesla,
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.620]   knowing that if anything happens to the car,
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.540]   they're never gonna blame me for doing the tires wrong
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.220]   'cause it was their responsibility,
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.020]   and they actually had the tire in stock
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.680]   and could replace it that day,
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.740]   made me much more interested in just doing that
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.060]   than trying to get a deal.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.760]   Now, if I were buying four tires and I had time to plan,
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.060]   you could buy tires at Costco or Walmart,
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.900]   which my brother-in-law said both do a really good job,
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.560]   and you can ship them to yourself
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.640]   or you can even ship them to a lot of tire stores
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.900]   and they'll put them on.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.100]   And so you might be able to save a little bit doing that
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.960]   over buying the tires from the tire shop.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.800]   However, there are a few things that I didn't think about
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.520]   that would make me want to consider
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.180]   actually buying from a tire shop in the future.
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.920]   So one, guidance on which tires to get
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.600]   and how to think about those.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.360]   Two, at least my brother-in-law said
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.800]   that he manages the entire process
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.460]   for manufacturer guarantees for all of his customers
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.160]   that buy tires from him.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.340]   So if something goes wrong,
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.860]   he's gonna deal with the manufacturer,
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.240]   he's gonna get the refund, he's gonna do that.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.520]   He does free rotating, free flat repair
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.360]   for any tires purchased from him.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.180]   So a lot of those extra perks you'll get
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.780]   from buying from a tire shop,
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.920]   you won't get if you ship them the tires.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.720]   And so yes, you might save 20, 30 bucks per tire,
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   but you gotta ask whether that's worth it.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.000]   And it really depends on the savings.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.640]   So I'll let you make that call,
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.840]   but I did wanna share some of the tips he gave
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.620]   because when Ashley wrote the question, I was like,
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.380]   on many things I might not have a good answer,
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.420]   but at least in this case,
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:37.980]   I have a brother-in-law who owns a tire shop.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.300]   So if there are other questions for him,
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.900]   let me know and I can ask.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.900]   Finally, I got another question from a reader.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.880]   I'll keep anonymous on the off chance
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.420]   that his girlfriend is listening,
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.700]   but he said he's ready to propose to his girlfriend
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.820]   any hacks for buying an engagement ring,
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.740]   either where to look, cards to put the purchase on or what.
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.580]   And I'll share my advice
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.500]   because I went through this process with Amy years ago.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.600]   And as much as I wanted credit card points for this purchase
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.440]   because it was a large purchase,
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.680]   ultimately I found that negotiating with cash
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.840]   for things like jewelry can result in a discount
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:13.560]   that is much bigger than the value of the points you'll get.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.300]   So my strategy was I went into a jeweler,
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.160]   I talked, I figured out what I wanted, I got a price.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.440]   I came back in a few days, not looking too desperate
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.300]   and said, okay, I'll do this, but I want this price.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.200]   I low balled, we did a little negotiating,
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.280]   little did the jeweler know at the time,
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.480]   but I had brought all cash, like actual cash with me.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.520]   And I said, can you do this price?
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.680]   I can't actually remember the price
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.920]   off the top of my head now.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.360]   And he said, I can't do that price.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.800]   And then I just took that much in cash,
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.900]   put it on the table and said,
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.720]   I will do this right now or no.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.380]   And I think the fact that there was cash on the counter
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.000]   made him realize I was serious
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.120]   and I ended up getting a much better deal.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   Now, had I paid full price and put it on a card,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.480]   I would have gotten some points,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.120]   but those points weren't worth anywhere close
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.000]   to the discount I got paying cash.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.920]   So that said, if there is a very specific piece of jewelry
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.980]   you want and you can only get it one place
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.720]   and there's no better deal you can get paying in cash,
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.300]   or if you're trying to negotiate a deal
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.580]   and the best you can get paying in cash is 1% off,
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.160]   then yeah, I would put it on a card.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.400]   I would pick a card that gets two points per dollar,
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.120]   like the Venture or the Venture X,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.020]   or I'd get a new card that I could hit a signup bonus on
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.920]   and get 7,500,000 points from the signup bonus.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   So that's how I think about it.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.280]   That's what I got for rings.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.160]   Last question I have on the docket for today
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.240]   is around BlockFi.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.680]   As people know, I had a meaningful amount of money
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.500]   in BlockFi.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.760]   I guess I still do, or it's still somewhere.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.620]   And so Amardeep wrote out and said,
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.920]   "I'd love to know if you could just give everyone an update
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.440]   on what the current status is, best you know it,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.520]   and what people should do."
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.780]   So for me, I got a letter from BlockFi saying,
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.380]   "This is how much we believe that you have in your account
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.660]   as of the date that they decided was the date
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:57.100]   they're looking at balances.
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.740]   If this amount is right, you don't need to do anything.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:02.500]   If this amount is wrong, please file a claim."
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500]   So fortunately for me, that amount was right.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.500]   So I didn't file a claim and don't feel the need to.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.180]   And now I'm just sitting back and waiting
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:13.060]   as they go through this bankruptcy process.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.680]   Right now, I'm pretending the money doesn't exist
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.300]   because I have no idea what will become of it.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.420]   And I would much rather be pleasantly surprised
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.820]   that I get a lot of it back than expect it to be there
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.140]   and be very sad that it won't.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.260]   So I've already kind of mourned the loss
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.140]   of the money for now.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.300]   I am optimistic that it won't be a complete zero,
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.180]   but mentally the way I like to handle these things
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.100]   is write it to zero now and get something back
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.240]   instead of assuming it'll be something.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.380]   I'm hoping it'll be more than 50% of what it was,
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.880]   but I have no idea if it's gonna happen this year,
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.340]   next year, or further out.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.460]   So it's a really crappy situation for a lot of people,
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.940]   myself included, and I'm just hoping
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.940]   that they can figure things out quickly
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.660]   and make people as whole as possible.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.020]   I think that's it.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.860]   I covered a lot.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.300]   Obviously, if you have follow-ups,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.660]   if you have more questions, please reach out to me.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.260]   I would love to hear from you.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.420]   I'd love to include those questions
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.740]   in the next few of these.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.420]   We're gonna do one on travel points and miles.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.060]   I'm gonna do one with Amy on relationships, family, and kids.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.100]   So lots of stuff to come.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.540]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.300]   Thank you for supporting me, and I'll see you next week.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:37.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
