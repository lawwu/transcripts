[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   It's a rather unique week for us here on the podcast. We're featuring three episodes on
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   Christian hedonism. And today, in a longer than normal episode, we're going to look at
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760]   the relationship between Christian hedonism and Reformed theology. And on Wednesday, we're
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.080]   going to look at Pastor John's fears and expectations for Christian hedonism after he's gone. And
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.120]   we end the week looking at the name Desiring God, some alternatives, and why Pastor John
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.920]   settled on the one he did. It'll be an important week for questions like that. But first up,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.000]   Pastor John, in your book Desiring God, you called this thing, Christian hedonism, a philosophy
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.440]   of life. That's pretty sweeping. In other places, you call it Reformed Christian hedonism.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.400]   So is Christian hedonism an alternative way of conceiving Reformed theology? Is it a different
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.040]   theology in the sense that it rejects some tenets of Reformed theology and replaces them
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.600]   with better tenets? Can you help us get some clarity on this? In your mind, what is Christian
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.640]   hedonism's relationship to historic Reformed theology?
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.840]   Well, I'll try. It's really big, and yet so helpful for me to think about this. Now, before
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.520]   I do that, there are no doubt some listeners who don't know the central ideas of either
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.520]   of those terms, like Reformed theology or Christian hedonism. So let me give just a
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.600]   word about each. The central conviction of Christian hedonism, as I've tried to develop
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.360]   it biblically over the years, is God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.560]   in Him. Or another way to say it would be that we magnify God as our supreme treasure
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.760]   when we cherish Him more than anyone or anything else. That's the central contention of Christian
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   hedonism with the implication that therefore we should pursue our satisfaction in God and
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:20.960]   our cherishing of Him above all things. The central conviction of Reformed theology, I
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.120]   would say, is that the glory of God is the greatest reality in the universe, and that
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   God upholds and communicates this glory by saving sinners through Christ in such a way
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   that His sovereign grace is the ultimate and decisive cause of all faith and all obedience.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   That would be the central idea of Reformed theology, as I use the term anyway.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.000]   Now, as I've thought about how to clarify the relationship between Christian hedonism
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.640]   and Reformed theology, I was reading recently in volume one of John Owen's works, the
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.200]   volume that contains his two catechisms, and I noticed that Owen, like most Reformed theologians,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   enfolds the sovereign saving work of Christ by referring to His three offices as prophet,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.000]   Christ the prophet, Christ the priest, and Christ the king. And so it occurred to me
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.520]   that it might be illuminating to ask, do Christian hedonists add a fourth category, a fourth
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.840]   office? Do Christian hedonists say that Reformed theology needs to be altered, revised, so
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.120]   that we now have the work of Christ being unfolded around four offices—prophet, priest,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:58.360]   king, and treasure? Now, the answer to that question is no. No. We don't need a revision.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:08.120]   We're not proposing a redefinition or a restructuring or a revision of Reformed theology so that
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.000]   Christ now has four offices—prophet, priest, king, and treasure. Here's why. The offices,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.920]   as they're often called to distinguish them from Christ's person, the offices of prophet,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:31.720]   priest, and king are categories of Christ's actions. As prophet, He speaks with absolute
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.480]   authority. As priest, He suffers and dies for His people. As king, He rules over all
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   things. In the exercise of each of these offices, He does all that needs to be done for the
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.680]   ultimate aim of exalting God's glory and saving His people. Treasure, on the other
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.520]   hand, used as a noun, like prophet, priest, and king. Treasure, used as a noun, referring
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.760]   to Christ, unlike prophet, priest, and king, is not a category of action. It's a category
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:21.960]   of value. Calling Christ the highest treasure in the universe does not imply that He does
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:31.880]   any new acts not done as prophet, priest, and king. Rather, it asserts that in all the
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.980]   acts that He does as prophet, priest, and king, He proves Himself to be supremely valuable.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.840]   He is supremely valuable as priest in His suffering and dying because He covers our
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.760]   sin and removes God's wrath so that all legal barriers to eternal blessedness are removed.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.600]   And the sanctifying, glorifying power of the Holy Spirit is purchased and secured. He's
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:08.360]   supremely valuable as king in ruling because He subdues all our foes, removes all our defilements,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.000]   transforms us into the likeness of Christ, and works things together for our good. He
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   is supremely valuable as prophet in His speaking because saving and sanctifying faith live
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.640]   by hearing the Word of God. Now, to clarify how Christian hedonism deals
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   with these offices, rather than adding to them, deals with these offices and Christ's
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:47.040]   value in performing them, we need to distinguish between intrinsic value and experienced value.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:56.160]   This is so important to get this. So Christ is intrinsically valuable in the objective
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:04.240]   excellence and beauty and perfection of His person and work. This intrinsic value exists
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.800]   whether there are any other beings in the universe to see it and respond to it or not.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:21.040]   God knows His own worth and the worth of His Son, and He cannot deny Himself, 2 Timothy
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.480]   2:13. That's intrinsic value, whether we see it, experience it or not. But in creation,
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.440]   the reason God created things, in creation and incarnation, the reason He became a God-man,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.680]   in redemption, the reason He died and rose again to save a people, in creation, incarnation,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:51.200]   and redemption, God willed that the supreme intrinsic value of Christ, the radiance of
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:59.440]   His own glory, become experienced value. Intrinsic value, whether anybody experiences it or not,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.720]   and He willed that it become in His people experienced value. That is, He willed that
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:16.800]   there come into being an elect, redeemed, transformed people who would experience Christ
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   in a way that would suitably exalt His supreme intrinsic beauty and worth. And here is where
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:38.880]   Christian hedonism comes to the fore. Christian hedonism draws out of Scripture and out of
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:47.720]   the historic Reformed catechisms and confessions the implicit truth. So hear me, I'm saying
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:55.800]   that Christian hedonism is really there in historic Reformed theology, at least implicitly.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:02.560]   And what I'm doing, what Christian hedonism is doing, is simply drawing out the implicit
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:14.000]   truth that this experience of the value of Christ in the hearts of His people is essential
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.440]   to glorifying the worth of Christ. And Christian hedonism argues that this heart experience,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:37.200]   which suitably exalts the intrinsic value of Christ, includes joy, delight, satisfaction,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:45.440]   cherishing in the excellencies of Christ. In other words, Christian delight in the worth
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:58.320]   of Christ is essential to glorifying His worth as it ought to be glorified. Where Christ's
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:07.520]   intrinsic worth and beauty are not enjoyed supremely above all other realities, Christ
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:16.560]   is not suitably exalted. That's the fundamental insight and assertion of Christian hedonism.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:28.360]   The supreme value of Christ, the supreme intrinsic value of Christ, the pearl of great price,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:39.080]   will not be honored, glorified, magnified as it ought to be where He is not, where that
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:50.880]   glory is not enjoyed as the soul's supreme treasure. So the foundational imperative of
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:11:00.860]   Christian hedonism follows. The Spirit-empowered, Word-sustained pursuit of joy in Christ is
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:12.320]   therefore mandatory for all human beings, divinely mandatory for all human beings, because
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:21.840]   it is essential to the full glorifying of God in a way that accords with His beauty
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:29.680]   and worth. Now what does all that imply about the relationship between Christian hedonism
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:37.760]   and Reformed theology? Six things, very briefly. One, Christian hedonism is not a replacement
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.400]   of historic Reformed categories of theology, such as Christ as prophet, priest, and king.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:52.960]   Number two, Christian hedonism is a bringing to the fore of implicit and latent assumptions
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:12:01.720]   about the value dimension of the reality behind those historic biblical categories. For example,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:08.240]   Christ as prophet is supremely valuable in His voice. Christ as priest is supremely valuable
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:16.040]   in His suffering. Christ as king is supremely valuable in His ruling. Christian hedonism
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.640]   forces that issue, brings that to the fore. Third, Christian hedonism is a clarifying
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.080]   of the ultimate goal of all God's Trinitarian work. Christian hedonism makes explicit that
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:38.640]   the ultimate aim of all God's works, namely, to the praise of the glory of God's grace,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:50.280]   Ephesians 1, 6, 12, 14, that goal, the praise of the glory of God's grace is only authentic
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:58.360]   and God-exalting where that praise is glad in the glory of God. And thus, Christian hedonism
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:07.400]   presses home the truth that the ultimate goal of all things is the God-glorifying gladness
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:14.040]   of Christ's blood-bought people because short of that, He doesn't get His full glory. Or,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.360]   say it one more way, Christian hedonism contends that if the final state of humanity is not
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:30.400]   exuberant in the glory of God, the glory of God is not exalted in redemption. Fourth,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:37.440]   Christian hedonism is therefore a diagnostic test of whether all biblical and theological
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:46.720]   categories as they are written and preached are being handled, a diagnostic test of whether
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   we're handling biblical truth and historic reformed categories are being handled in a
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.200]   way that helps readers and listeners see the reality behind the category for what it really
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   is, including its value, and thus helps us respond with feelings suitable to that value.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:21.360]   Fifth, Christian hedonism moves beyond point four, diagnosis. I said it was a diagnostic
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:29.440]   test. Now I'm saying it moves beyond diagnosis of failures to attain affectional faithfulness
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:37.880]   in theology and preaching. It moves beyond that to proactive, lukewarmness-presenting
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:45.120]   portrayals of biblical and theological reality. That's what I consider myself called to in
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:56.800]   this life, portrayals of proactive, lukewarmness-preventing biblical reality. In these portrayals, Christian
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:04.440]   hedonism affirms the historic reformed confessions and draws out of them and out of the scriptures
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:13.120]   behind them and under them the beauty and worth inherent in the realities these affirmations
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:23.400]   describe and draws attention to the Spirit-given human affections that correspond to that beauty
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:30.900]   and worth, without which these glories, these beauties will not be glorified as they ought.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.760]   And finally, number six, Christian hedonism expresses the ethical implications of these
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:46.240]   five observations by showing that without the pursuit, so here's the mandate, the pursuit
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:53.280]   of maximum joy in all that God is for us in Christ, worship toward God and love toward
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:01.640]   people in a way that fully honors Christ is not possible. So I hope that goes part of
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:09.960]   the way in clarifying how Christian hedonism relates to reformed theology.
