[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220]   One tip I've shared multiple times on the podcast and multiple times in the newsletter that I think is really worth sharing again is to go check for unclaimed money.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.640]   And the way this works is there are circumstances where someone might owe you money, they can't get it to you, or you haven't cashed a check, and so they pass it over to the state.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.540]   This might happen with a cable bill or a medical bill that you overpaid or you canceled an insurance policy and they owe you a refund.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.620]   And why I share this is because even though I've shared it multiple times in the newsletter, I thought I'm going to share it again and I'm actually going to do a quick poll of how much unclaimed money people found.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.820]   And while 47% of the people subscribed found no money, the results of the other 53% were super interesting.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:54.380]   So 31% found less than $100, 15% found $100 to $500, 3% found $500 to $1,000, and 5% found over $1,000 of unclaimed money in their name.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.800]   12% found $1,000 just by going to their state's unclaimed money site and searching.
