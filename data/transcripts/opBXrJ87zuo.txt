[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   This week, Randy Elkhorn joins us on the phone.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.940]   He is the author of the new book, Happiness.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.440]   You'll want to check it out.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.800]   Randy, as you know, God is happy.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.880]   Scripture tells us that God is happy.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.360]   So if God is so fundamentally and essentially happy all the time in himself, why does he
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.280]   seem so often to be ill-tempered in the biblical stories?
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.520]   I think what we've got to do is realize that sin is a reality in this world, and the suffering
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.880]   that comes out of sin.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.160]   We're under the fall.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.020]   We're under the curse.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.340]   Even though Christ has become a curse for us who believe in him, we recognize that we
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.080]   still face the realities of sin and suffering in this life.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.080]   This sin that infiltrates the world is a temporary condition.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.880]   I think this is the key to understanding how it is that God could be, from eternity past,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.040]   utterly happy within himself, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, delighting in each other.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.280]   I developed this in the book, and others have developed it, of course.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.000]   John Piper, in The Pleasures of God, develops it tremendously, and somewhat in Desiring
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   God as well.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.760]   That is this union of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Father who says, "This is my
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.880]   beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased."
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.360]   I think it's Luke 10, where it says, "Jesus then rejoiced in the Holy Spirit after telling
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.040]   his disciples to rejoice that their names are written in heaven."
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.720]   But he has always been happy.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.680]   He will always be happy, and he is predominantly happy now.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.200]   Sin is a temporary condition, so the causes for God's unhappiness are themselves temporary,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.320]   and his primary identity is as a happy God, not an unhappy one.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.600]   Sin is so prevalent, and the Bible is written to deal with the sin problem and point out
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.680]   the sin problem, hence we often do see a God with anger and wrath.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.160]   It's easy to overlook all of the loving-kindness passages, and all the God delighting in his
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.520]   people, and God being pleased, and the Master in Jesus' words saying to the servant, "Well
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.360]   done, my good and faithful servant.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.920]   Enter into your Master's happiness."
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.600]   Enter into a happiness far more ancient than the world itself, a happiness that preceded
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.360]   all creation, a happiness that goes on undaunted and will continue forever.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.120]   God not only says this to us so that at the end of our life we might be welcomed into
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.160]   his happiness, but so that we can front-load, so to speak, that happiness into our life
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.440]   right now because of his redemptive work.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.280]   Even then, when people will say, for instance, "Well, Jesus is called the Man of Sorrows,"
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.920]   and I get this a lot from people, and I'm writing a book on happiness.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.960]   By the way, unbelievers would always think it was great when I tell them I was writing
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   a book on happiness.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.160]   Then when I would say it to believers, they'd say, "Whoa, wait a minute," and scrunch up
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   their face.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   "Do you mean like giving joy?
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.600]   I mean, why are you talking about happiness?"
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.200]   I get a couple-page letter from a pastor telling me why I shouldn't write on the subject of
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.760]   happiness and all of that.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.080]   But for unbelievers, they see the appeal of it because that's what they long for.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   But look at Jesus.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.760]   He's called the Man of Sorrows, which people point out, but that's in Isaiah 53, and it's
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.880]   specifically in relationship to his redemptive work, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   grief.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.040]   He's pierced for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities and all of that.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   But even that redemptive work was done for the joy set before him, according to Hebrews
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   12.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.680]   So if we picture Jesus going around in perpetual sadness or anger and grumbling and looking
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.160]   to condemn more than to extend grace, then we're really not seeing the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.480]   Children were attracted to him, by the way.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   Who are children attracted to?
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.680]   They're not attracted to unhappy people.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.200]   When people today are saying, "Well, I've got the joy of Jesus way, way deep in my heart,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.280]   even though my life is pretty miserable," it's like, "Well, you know what?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.960]   I think that joy needs to work its way to your face once in a while."
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.320]   After all, we are called to rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I say rejoice.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.920]   And God, if he were not happy, would not call us to be happy.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.480]   And furthermore, if God were not happy, he could not be the source of our happiness,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.640]   because God can't give us what he doesn't have.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:22.560]   We are to value joy, happiness, gladness, delight, precisely because our God is characterized
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.720]   by that, and the gospel we preach to people should be a gospel of a holy God, yes, but
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.240]   also a happy God.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   Yes, amen.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.960]   Passages like 1 Timothy 1:11 and 1 Timothy 6:15 explicitly tell us that God is happy
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.400]   or blessed, as most translations put it.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   You know, I heard you recently argue in another interview somewhere that all the times in
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.360]   the Bible that talk about God delighting in someone or something means that God is essentially
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.760]   joyful because he is always postured to delight.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.480]   That's a fascinating point you make.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.560]   Exactly, because, you know, who delights?
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.240]   A person who has the capacity to delight and the desire and orientation to delight.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.080]   A person who delights in delighting, who is pleased by pleasure, who is happy in happiness.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.560]   Yeah, that is so insightful.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.040]   And, you know, some theologians say that God's wrath is the flip side of his love.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.960]   So if there's no love in God, there's no wrath.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.920]   They both come together.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.320]   Anger against sin is the flip side of his desire, then, for his creation to rejoice.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.680]   Would you say that?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.720]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:43.440]   Because I think the very fact that he is unhappy with sin is an indicator that sin is what
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.680]   robs people of happiness.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   So he is happy with that which is not only in conformity to his holy standards, but that
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.520]   which is in conformity to his happiness and delight.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.120]   He wants the best for us.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.040]   He wants sincerely for us to participate in his happiness.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.720]   And his joy and his delight and sin is the enemy of all that.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.280]   Yes, it sure is, Randy.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   Thank you for your time.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.240]   We're talking about Randy Elkhorn's new book, Happiness, my pick for the book of the year
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.680]   in 2015.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.080]   And tomorrow I'm going to ask Randy, how does worry and anxiety poison our joy?
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.920]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.240]   I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
