[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.600]   Today on Radical Personal Finance is live Q&A.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.640]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.920]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.800]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I am your host.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.480]   Today is Friday, and every Friday that I can possibly arrange an internet connection and
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.120]   the appropriate technology, I record a live Q&A call.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.400]   It works just like call-in talk radio.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:51.600]   You call in, ask your questions, and I do my best to give you a useful answer.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.440]   I don't screen these calls for content.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.840]   I don't screen them for questions.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.040]   You can call, make any comments, have any questions that you want, and I love doing
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040]   them.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.560]   The more I enjoy doing them, the more I enjoy answering the questions.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.600]   If you would like to join me on next week's call, please sign up to become a patron of

[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   There we go.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.320]   All right, we begin with John in Pennsylvania.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320]   John, welcome to the show.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   Hey Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:42.080]   I have a question, just curious about your thoughts on having money to remove pain points
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.320]   versus being frugal and having a lot of time for DIY projects.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.400]   I have more time than ever now, but I find myself, I have more time to work on my own
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.480]   things, but I'm finding it more and more difficult, even with more time, to justify
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.840]   doing some of these things, replacement of a door when I can have someone install it
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.600]   for a few hundred bucks, or even have a big project, paint the house coming up, and I'm
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   even considering outsourcing that a little bit.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.560]   Even though some of these things, they give me enjoyment to do them and satisfaction to
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.880]   get them done, but I feel like I'm even more guarded about my time now since a lot of it
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.880]   can be dedicated to spending with my kids.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.680]   I'm just kind of struggling with that.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.400]   On top of that, just being pretty frugal normally and not wanting to necessarily pay for these
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   services.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.880]   I'm curious about your thoughts on that and how you've kind of balanced that out.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.320]   I've thought a lot about this.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.720]   I was raised by a relatively frugal father who engaged with his children in a lot of
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.360]   around the house projects, and I noticed what a big difference that made in my life to have
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.800]   that experience.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560]   I've done lots of construction work.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.800]   I've been skilled in a lot of those areas more than the majority of my peers.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.880]   I've been involved in house projects from foundation to roofing, and that's given me
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.120]   a tremendous amount of personal confidence to have those experiences and to have those
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.240]   skills.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   By no means am I a skilled craftsman, but I saw it express itself.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.400]   For example, when I was in high school and we were building our senior class float, I
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.960]   would be there and my fellow classmates were just kind of staring dumbfoundedly at a pile
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.960]   of boards.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.560]   And kind of the basics of building things, the basics of construction seemed to be beyond
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.400]   their realm of experience, whereas for me it was not that way.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.720]   I could do it.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   And a lot of that was gained as just childhood projects.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.800]   We built a three-story tree fort and the woods next to our house when I was a kid.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.520]   But a lot of it came from being involved with projects around the house with my father.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.680]   Now simultaneously, I have never in my life enjoyed doing a lot of those things.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   It's never been something that brought me joy.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.080]   I find it deeply frustrating to deal with the inevitable problems and difficulties that
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.500]   come with DIY projects.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.720]   When I work with my hands, much of the time I feel largely inept.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.920]   I have a friend of mine, a close friend of mine growing up.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.240]   He is amazing just with working with his hands.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.260]   He has almost a sixth sense of how things are created, how to do things, and he has
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.060]   so much experience.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.020]   Watching him work is like magic.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.480]   And over the years I've discovered that I get exactly that same feeling when I engage
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.960]   in mental work, when I work with my brain.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.760]   My brain is flexible and for me, concepts that are difficult for other people come through
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.140]   very easily for me, whereas other people can't roll ideas around in their head in the way
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.220]   that I can.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.660]   But I can't roll tools around in my hand the way that other people can.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.260]   And so I've learned over the years that projects, DIY projects and construction projects, are
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.040]   a source of significant frustration for me personally.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.160]   And I would much rather simply earn the money and pay someone else to do them so that they're
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.460]   done and I can do the things that I enjoy, the things that make me money, the things
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.260]   that I just literally enjoy, that I physically enjoy doing.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.940]   And as long as I have enough money, it seems like a fairly wise way to approach it if I
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.940]   enjoy it.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.660]   Now, when you look at frugality and you look at people who have gone ahead of us and shared
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.900]   their wisdom with us, you often see the value of DIY projects.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.660]   Whether it's from someone living a conserver lifestyle, someone like one of my favorites,
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.980]   Charles Long, where he wrote the book How to Live Without a Salary.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.720]   One of the modern people like Mr. Money Mustache, who's inspired many people to build their
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.180]   own things, do their own things.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.020]   He spends half his time building stuff.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:12.060]   It seems that there's a very good parallel between building things yourself, doing things
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.060]   yourself and economic freedom.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.180]   I have in my library lots of books of people who move out to the country and build a homestead
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.820]   from scratch, very, very inexpensively, doing the work themselves.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.860]   I've read accounts of people who've built houses at astonishingly low prices because
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.860]   they built them using materials that they picked up for free and things that they got
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.420]   from the Habitat Restore, etc.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:47.740]   I believe that DIY and doing things yourself is a powerful tool, a powerful method that
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.660]   many people can use to enjoy personal freedom, to enjoy a sense of lifestyle freedom.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.180]   For me personally, I find them to be more constraining than freedom-giving.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.860]   If you tell me, "Joshua, listen, you don't have to have a job, but what you need to do
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.240]   instead is spend, say, five or six hours a day working on your own projects, building
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.100]   your own homestead," since it's generally such a source of frustration and annoyance
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.420]   for me personally, I would rather have the job.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.700]   I would – now, you'd question which job.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.180]   I may not want to have a job filled with drudgery.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.780]   I may not want to be the proverbial cubicle slave.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:37.140]   I may not want to have a job that is boring for me and something to which I'm not well-suited,
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.020]   but I can come up with long lists of jobs that I would rather have working for other
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.900]   people versus having personal time freedom and sitting around and doing my own projects.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.860]   So as I see it, there are a few ways to think through this.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.360]   The first thing you can do is recognize, "I'm the kind of person who enjoys doing these
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.860]   kinds of projects.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.740]   They bring me a sense of personal satisfaction and joy.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.260]   And so because of that, I'm going to do them, and I'm going to save the money.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260]   I'm going to be the tinkerer.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.740]   I'm going to get the materials on sale.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.500]   I'm just the kind of person that's good at this, that enjoys that.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.060]   I have people in my own family who are that way, and I respect it.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.140]   I think it's a very powerful strategy."
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.660]   On the other hand, you can say, "I'm not that kind of person."
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.540]   And that's what I'm trying to make clear.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.020]   Like I have learned about myself.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.020]   I'm not that kind of person."
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.700]   So what do you do if you're not that kind of person?
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:35.340]   Well, one, you can just simply be financially productive enough to be able to pay for the
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.300]   work to be done for you and recognize that that's just part of the transfer.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.860]   I feel really good about that.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.300]   I'm good at making money.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.700]   I'm very skilled at it.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.180]   And I feel really good at being able to employ and support other people and have that money
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.340]   flow quickly out into the local economy.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.460]   And that helps other people to do their work and helps me to do more of what I enjoy doing.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.380]   And so I've known many wealthy people over the years who simply pay other people to do
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.660]   things for themselves, but they're financially productive enough to where it's not a problem.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.200]   The ratios are in line.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.460]   You might not be super financially productive.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.940]   In that scenario then, I think that you can think carefully about the kind of living setup
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.940]   that you engage in.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.620]   You know, right now I'm living in a rented house.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.300]   I don't need to do any of that stuff.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.680]   You can live in Airbnbs, traveling around the world.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.420]   You can choose to do something where you don't have a house.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.580]   Maybe you don't mind boat maintenance projects and so you live on a boat or an RV or in a
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.860]   tent or in a yurt, who knows.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.220]   And so you can always adjust things on the outside and choose an unusual lifestyle where
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.060]   you don't have to do a lot of those things.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.500]   And so you can adjust it either way and you should judge yourself and say, "Am I the kind
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   of person that takes satisfaction in these things or am I the kind of person who doesn't
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.740]   take satisfaction in them?"
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.540]   And I think that either one is fine.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.700]   Now one caveat I personally have.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:08.100]   I value so much what I described in the beginning, the experience that I had as a child learning
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.900]   how to do some things.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:18.900]   And I observed how my own father used chores, manual labor, as training tools for his children.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.300]   Tools to teach discipline, tools to teach work ethic, and tools to teach a very diverse
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   skill set.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.660]   And again, I value that from the sense of personal resilience.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.540]   The fact that I have a diverse skill set fills me with a sense of personal confidence that
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.700]   I'll never be out of work long term.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.380]   I'll never not be able to support myself and my family.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.940]   Even if I'm making a basic living, because of the diverse skill set and the diverse jobs
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.540]   that I've done and the many different opportunities that even my parents exposed me to, then that's
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.780]   built my personal confidence.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.240]   So as a father of young children, one of the things that I am trying to observe is how
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.100]   can I impart similar skills to my own children?
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.740]   I don't believe it has to be the fact that I do it all with them, but I am willing and
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:16.180]   desirous of doing things with them simply for the acquisition of personal skills.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.080]   They may not be the kinds of things that I personally would do for fun, but I'm willing
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.140]   to do that because it will give me an opportunity to teach my children some skills, give them
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.940]   an opportunity to be exposed to certain things.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.940]   That doesn't have to all be done myself in my own house.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.100]   I can keep an eye open.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.540]   One thing that my father did really well was he worked hard to try to find work opportunities
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.020]   for his children.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.020]   And so my brothers and I, we did construction work, but my dad was not a carpenter, but
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.620]   he arranged for us to work at a very young age with a skilled carpenter.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.480]   And we learned a lot of skills from that.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.760]   And so I don't have to do all the work myself, but I'm conscious of the fact that there may
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.040]   be many times where there's something I want to do.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.360]   I could just simply buy it done for me, but I'm not going to do that.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.320]   I'm going to go ahead and do it myself because it'll give me a chance to work with my children
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.720]   and to expose them to some of the skills.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.560]   So I think it's a balancing act and there's not a right or wrong answer.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.760]   It's important to identify the fact that doing things yourself is a powerful strategy for
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.520]   saving money and building wealth and living financially independent.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.240]   Just for me, what I've learned is that I wouldn't want to do it.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.400]   I don't want to live that lifestyle.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.760]   I'd rather have the job versus living that lifestyle, but that doesn't mean it's not
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.580]   appropriate for many people.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.000]   So I say judge it yourself and balance among those factors.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Okay.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.400]   Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.760]   It puts in a lot of things that also come up in my mind and that's sort of the problem.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.360]   All those things are kind of halfway between point.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.120]   I get a lot of satisfaction out of seeing a job done, but I have no real enjoyment of
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.600]   the process generally.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's usually very frustrating and takes twice as long.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.280]   And then I say, okay, well at least it's an example to my kids that we do things ourselves
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.020]   and we have the capability to do this, but they're also a little too young to participate
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.640]   without getting bored after 20 minutes.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.440]   So do I take on a job that takes me two days or three days, whereas they're only going
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.800]   to engage with it maybe a couple of minutes here and there and is that worth it?
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.520]   And then the balance of the money thing, it's always been, well, when I had a job and I
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.480]   had an income, I could balance it real easily saying, okay, it's going to take me this long
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.600]   or I could make this much over here.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.120]   Now that I don't have that, I thought that calculation would be a lot easier to just
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:45.880]   do it myself, but it turns out to me at the time is worth more than the money job was,
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.680]   so the hourly rate I was getting.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.360]   So it almost threw it in the opposite direction that I thought it was going to.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.040]   And I find myself wanting to outsource even more.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.760]   But I think you touched on all the different things that I've been thinking of and I appreciate
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   that.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.000]   But I think the biggest overwhelming thing is, do I enjoy the process?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.880]   And I think that's an overwhelming no, even though I enjoy the after effect, the satisfaction
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   of having done it myself.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.000]   But yeah, I just got to keep turning through these things.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.120]   There's no question that the ages of your children make a big difference and you'll
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.080]   do one thing now that you won't do in five years and vice versa.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.160]   So at the end of the day, the only formula is to calculate the opportunity cost.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.440]   Okay, if I don't do this myself, what else will I do?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.160]   And is it worth the money for me to do the other thing because I have more time and I'm
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.960]   doing something that I would rather do?
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.640]   Or is this a good opportunity cost?
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.840]   Sometimes maybe there's in between.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.560]   For example, one thing that you can do when you have more time freedom is you can be more
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.080]   involved in the details of the job without actually physically doing the work.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.880]   Back to my father.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:57.680]   When we were growing up, he needed a bigger house and so he wanted to build a bigger house.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.160]   But he didn't want to spend a lot of money, but he was also keeping, he had a job.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.840]   Now his job provided him with some flexibility, but he had a job.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.640]   So what he did was he kind of threaded the needle.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.600]   In the beginning, he hired a contractor to build the shell of the house, but he worked
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.880]   with that contractor providing a lot of assistance so that the contractor's prices were lower.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.960]   But the contractor built the shell.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:28.240]   Then once the shell of the house was completed, then my dad worked as the subcontractor.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.120]   In most cases, excuse me, he worked himself as the contractor hiring the subcontractors
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.080]   in most cases and then doing some of the work himself from time to time.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.520]   So he saved some tens of thousands of dollars by doing that, by inserting himself into the
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.960]   actual time, but he didn't try to do everything.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.560]   So let's go back to a house project.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.780]   Maybe with your painting job, maybe you can use kind of an in-between option.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.520]   You may not want to actually commit yourself to two weeks to repaint the house, but you
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:04.880]   might not also want to go and contact a painting contractor and pay a retail price.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:11.480]   So perhaps what you do is you understand what painting work you're going to get done.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.760]   You go and you purchase all the paint and the equipment needed to prepare the house
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.040]   for painting.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.840]   You involve your children in that, going with you, choosing the colors, choosing the paints,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.320]   having everything ready.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.240]   And then you hire day laborers and you supervise their labor to make sure that the work is
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.080]   being done well.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.680]   Maybe you help them here and there, but most of it is just supervision and you kind of
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.760]   split the difference.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:44.020]   Maybe you save 30% or 40% of what the contractor would charge you by supervising, but because
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.420]   you're there and you're able to supervise without physically getting involved every
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.020]   single day, you can make sure that the job is well done.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:56.220]   So that might be a way to satisfice these different options that you're considering.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.100]   Yeah, no, that's good.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.100]   I appreciate that.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.980]   I just got to kind of take a step back and think of which parts I want to do and what's
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.380]   worth it and which parts I can outsource.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.380]   Exactly.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.380]   I think I appreciate that.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.380]   Thank you.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.380]   My pleasure.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.380]   Always love talking to you, John.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.380]   Thank you for calling in today.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.140]   We go on to, looks like Steve in Toronto.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   Steve, welcome to the show.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.140]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.140]   Hey, good afternoon.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.020]   Good afternoon, sir.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.020]   I have a question.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.580]   I don't know if you'll be able to provide a whole insight because I'm not sure if it's
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.860]   something that you've done, but I'm hoping your familiarity will be, you'll at least
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.100]   have some thoughts.
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.860]   Recently traveled to Mexico and just had a really fantastic time and kind of have some
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.460]   life changes going on and was thinking about maybe potentially kind of moving down there
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460]   and starting a business.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:50.980]   So I was curious both on the kind of legal side, like in terms of like immigrating or
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.700]   becoming a permanent resident, kind of what needs to be done there in terms of owning
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.020]   and operating a business.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.660]   And then also like if you had any thoughts about kind of the potential barriers like
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:09.140]   you saw someone who's not from Mexico might encounter when trying to like own and operate
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.340]   a consumer facing business in Mexico.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.420]   Tell me more about the kind of business that you're imagining.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.900]   I don't have, I have a couple of different ideas.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.260]   So one of them would be like a bar and restaurant type business.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.900]   Another one would be something like an Airbnb or some kind of a bed and breakfast maybe
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.940]   with some kind of incorporated tours or something like that.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:36.540]   That would mostly be targeting Christian and expats.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:44.540]   So I can't give you specific ideas on the details of starting the business in terms
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.980]   of the necessary licenses.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.060]   That would be an appropriate conversation to pick up the phone and talk specifically
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.780]   with a lawyer.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:58.180]   Mexico is extremely open and so in general I think that you'll be able to do it.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:03.100]   Virtually any country in the world loves to see businessmen come with money to invest,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:08.420]   start a business and build economic activity.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.860]   And so the basic answer is going to be I'm quite confident that you'll be able to do
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.100]   it.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.580]   It may be a combination of approaches.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.100]   You might go ahead and get a residency visa that doesn't allow for employment.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.780]   Then you'll change that to some kind of business visa.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:33.540]   That short answer is I don't know the specific visas that you will need but I'm confident
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.820]   that you will be able to do it if you simply talk with an attorney and tell them what you're
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:41.260]   thinking about and bring that to them.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.260]   That's your magic key.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.980]   A businessman can go to virtually any country in the world and if you say I'm here to open
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.260]   a business, especially something like a physical business where they can count the number of
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.820]   employees, you can show them your roster of employees and all of the money that you're
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.420]   investing into the business, they will open their arms and welcome you in.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:13.420]   Okay, that kind of jives with what I was initially thinking.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:19.980]   How about in terms of tangling through local regulations and doing all that in something
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   that's not your first language, do you have any thoughts or tips or tricks or anything
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.180]   you would like in terms of how you would approach that problem?
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.140]   Yeah, so the first thing is call a lawyer.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.220]   Email the guy that I interviewed recently on the show at sanmigael-legal.com.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.860]   His website is sanmigael-legal.com.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.420]   That's a lawyer that I recommend you start with.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.860]   He can help with the immigration stuff if you need that and then you'll probably work
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.460]   with somebody locally.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.540]   If you don't speak any Spanish, you will definitely need to find somebody who can interpret for
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.340]   you, maybe hiring a professional interpreter, might be hiring, working with a local business
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.020]   partner, somebody who can interpret for you.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.500]   There's no question that will make your life difficult not being able to speak at least
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.260]   basic Spanish.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:10.180]   But there are lots of people who go to Mexico or wherever and open a business and do well.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.020]   I think the most important thing is just studying the market and making sure that there's actually
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.340]   a demand for what you want to do.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.460]   And then as with any business, going in with as much investment as you need in order to
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.460]   get the doors open and see what the demand is but without getting in over your head.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.580]   That's just generalized business advice.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:36.940]   But you're going to be dealing with the local markets, the local rental markets, etc.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.980]   Now can there be surprises along the way?
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.980]   Absolutely.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:46.340]   Every country has its own challenges, its own things that are just different about that
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.340]   country.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:55.060]   And that will be the various forms needed when hiring somebody, subscribing them to
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:01.820]   the local health insurance laws, the local social employment insurance systems, etc.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.300]   But most of that stuff is fairly standardized.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:10.780]   And I think in general, as long as you're a bit wary, I think that it's just going to
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.700]   be the nature of what happens locally.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.280]   So you'll figure out the local customs.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.620]   Just like if I came to Canada and I came to you and said I want to open a business, you
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.820]   would say, "Well, here's the guy that talked to this accountant and that accountant will
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.540]   say here's what you need to do."
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.420]   So I would go to Mexico and I would start looking for a good local accountant and a
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.300]   good local lawyer, somebody who speaks English.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.980]   Usually that'll be your best place to start is if you can find a local lawyer who can
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.140]   speak English, who can advise you on the local customs, etc.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:45.720]   Pay them some fees just to work for you and then start the process and see what they tell
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   you.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.840]   Your local lawyer and your local accountant are usually, in my experience, probably the
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.440]   best place to start because they'll have the networks, they'll know the people in the local
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:01.180]   administration, they'll know the people in the local county government, they'll know
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:06.480]   the relevant inspectors, they'll be able to refer you a lot of times to the vendors.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.360]   And so they're usually the local pillar of the community and that's the support that
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.880]   you'll need when you start.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.600]   Mad Fientist Awesome, awesome, fantastic.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.800]   I'm excited to kind of see where this takes me.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.600]   Dave Great.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   What area of Mexico are you targeting?
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.560]   Mad Fientist So far I've been to Puerto Vallarta which
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.600]   we liked a lot but going to be going to other places.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.080]   Guadalajara and Mexico City are kind of next in line.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.560]   Dave Okay, awesome.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:41.520]   Yeah, I think all of those you can find something that's going to work for you and when you
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.080]   find it, give it a shot.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.840]   My only kind of closing comment, how much money would you anticipate investing into
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.440]   your business there?
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.800]   Mad Fientist Obviously that kind of depends on what we
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.880]   decide to go into but we're probably prepared to fund at a six-figure level if needed.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:08.120]   Dave Okay, so just remember that all of the power
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.600]   is on your side.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.760]   All of the demand is on your side.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.800]   You don't go in thinking that you are a little fish, thinking that you're just the kind of
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.880]   guy that, "Ah, well who wants to hear from me?"
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.920]   You're not.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:33.640]   You are exactly what every politician on a local level wants.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.440]   They want you to come and invest in their community.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.880]   Now you shouldn't be arrogant of course.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.280]   You're Canadian, you're not going to be arrogant.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.520]   You're going to be very kind but the point is that you should recognize the value that
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   you bring.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.880]   I'm not sure if it works this way in Canada but in the United States, let's say that a
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.840]   sports team is looking for a place to go or a business is looking for a place to go.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:06.400]   That business will have all of the local politicians coming in and vying for that business to relocate
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.800]   to their specific area and it really is powerful.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.860]   So you have the same power.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.160]   You can do exactly the same thing in the same way that if I'm running, what was it, Amazon
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.960]   a couple of years ago put out bids and they had hundreds of cities saying, "Come here,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.040]   we'll give you all kinds of tax breaks, we'll give you all kinds of assurances, etc."
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   If you're going to go and open a business and potentially invest six figures into that
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.240]   business, the exact same benefits are going to be yours.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.800]   So the first thing I would do is talk to a lawyer in a local area, find a lawyer in Puerto
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.480]   Vallarta, ask him your immigration questions, ask him about the business licenses and then
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   have that lawyer arrange a meeting with you with the mayor of Puerto Vallarta or the relevant
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.040]   other politicians and start to build a relationship there with them and see what they might be
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.560]   willing to offer you because they will offer you things, you just have to make it known.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.720]   Don't try to do it all in secret, see what they can offer you.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.080]   They can help you to arrange a prime location, there might be tax breaks that they'll offer
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.440]   you and a lawyer can help you navigate that.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.080]   So think of yourself not as, "Well, I'm going to go and ask for permission."
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.760]   Recognize that what you're bringing is exactly what every single politician and every local
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.360]   government wants.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.280]   Somebody to come in, build a business, employ local people, build something that's going
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.080]   to attract tourists, that's going to attract other businesses to the area and generally
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.680]   build their town for the well-being of the local people.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.800]   All right, and with that we move on to the state of Tennessee.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.240]   How can I serve you today?
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.520]   Hello Joshua, can you hear me?
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.480]   I can hear you well, go ahead sir.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.840]   Awesome.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:58.480]   You have helped me on a couple of your consultation calls and I want to highly recommend that
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.440]   to some of your listeners.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.560]   But I have a question or kind of a statement and then a question.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:12.380]   My brother-in-law and I have bought rental properties, apartments, houses, etc. for years
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:20.480]   and we grinded out on some of these apartments, lower income and it's a lot of work and not
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   a lot of appreciation.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:26.680]   Well, we sold them off and we're rolling it.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.160]   We had to do a 1031 because we've had them for close to 20 years.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.220]   So there's really nothing to buy out there.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:43.040]   So what we kind of figured out is we did probably eight or nine owner finance situations with
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.040]   Mexicans.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   They put down a pretty nice down payment and we basically put it 10%.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.480]   They don't seem to mind paying 10% and they always pay, they're never late.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   Awesome.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:00.120]   We got a pretty good reputation with them and looking back over the last 20 years, we
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   figured out, man, we're making more money doing that than anything else.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:12.920]   So we're rolling all this money from apartments into about 20 to 25, 120, 180 thousand dollar
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.080]   houses and we're just going to owner finance them to Mexicans.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.120]   You see anything wrong with that?
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   No.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:27.800]   I think that, I mean, probably the only risk would be, so first of all, to clarify, you're
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.880]   doing this in the United States and you're renting primarily to Mexican immigrants.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.120]   Do you know if those Mexican immigrants are in the United States with the appropriate
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.440]   documents or without the appropriate documents?
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   No idea.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.440]   No idea.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.720]   I have no idea and really don't care.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.680]   So I think the only risk would be if one of your tenants gets deported.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.320]   But I think that's, first of all, if you have some collateral, I think that's probably a
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.680]   relatively minor risk.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.440]   So in my experience with Mexican immigrants to the United States, you're dealing with
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.520]   a really wonderful culture.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.080]   In my experience, most Mexican immigrants to the United States will tend to be fairly
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.160]   conservative in terms of their approach.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.320]   They're very family oriented.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.480]   They're accustomed to working for opportunity.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.000]   They're accustomed to kind of the Mexican values of community.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.560]   Mexico is a very community oriented society.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:31.920]   And so I would be thrilled with that business model myself.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   I just think your only risk is if one of them gets deported.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.280]   Now probably somebody else would step in and probably work to kind of keep the deal going.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.760]   If you've got enough earnest money where it would be pretty expensive for them to be deported,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:49.160]   then my guess would be that they would want to keep the contract alive even if one of
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:54.560]   their friends or relations or coworkers or someone else in that community came in and
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.640]   was willing to take over the contract or willing just to...
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.000]   Their name is on it, but the money keeps coming in.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.920]   So no, I think that you can do really well serving a community like that.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.160]   And it's one of those win-win scenarios where it can be very difficult for an immigrant
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.040]   to get a fair deal in the large commercial space.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:23.680]   It's very difficult for an immigrant with a limited credit history to go and work with
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.120]   a bank.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.600]   And especially depending on whether you're dealing with what's usually in the sociological
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   analysis called an acculturated immigrant or an unacculturated immigrant.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.160]   Oftentimes unacculturated immigrants to the United States are taken advantage of very
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.120]   heavily by the overall system.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:48.240]   And so when they find that, "Hey, here's a guy who is fair to us, gives us a fair deal,
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.800]   doesn't take advantage of us.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.480]   We pay him certainly higher rates than we would pay if we had an 800 credit score and
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.760]   a W-2 job and an H1N1 visa or a green card."
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.360]   Certainly they're paying you for the privilege, but as long as you're treating them fairly,
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   that's wonderful.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.840]   And they will help, as you've experienced, to refer you as a good service provider within
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.880]   the local community.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.520]   So I don't see any risk in it other than the risk of deportation.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.600]   And I think you've got enough earnest money and enough, as you said, you've got a good
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   reputation.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.920]   I think you would fill the house again and be able to sell it again if the worst came.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   Right.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:34.800]   In fact, we actually had a guy probably 12, well, seven or eight years ago that had a
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   house that got deported.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:44.080]   And the way the contracts are written up is they're pretty one-sided towards us, that
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.920]   it's more like a rent-to-own situation, even though it's a contract for deed.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:54.000]   So this guy had paid us something like 12 years and he got deported.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   And we legally, of course, we didn't even consider it.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.400]   We could have said, "Well, we're just out."
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:08.520]   But we handed it off to his daughter and she actually got the house paid off last year.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.720]   So that kind of got us some pretty good will, I think, in that community.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:22.640]   Like you said, we didn't get enough down that if they walked away, we'd be fine.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:28.320]   The thing we've noticed is they go in there and they take a $100,000 house and a year
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:35.400]   or two later, it's a $160,000 house with all the improvements.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.600]   My experience, I've worked with a lot of immigrants just because I speak Spanish in the United
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   States.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   I've worked with day laborers.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.960]   I've worked – I spent several years working on a farm.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.160]   And so all of my – I was the only white guy on the farm.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.640]   And every single one of my coworkers was Mexican, Guatemalan, Honduran, etc.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.280]   I worked for several years in lawn maintenance, same exact thing.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.720]   I was the only white guy on the lawn maintenance crews.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:05.680]   And so I just got a good sense, probably more than most people of the community.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.840]   And I'm telling you, one of the things that bugs me so much – I'm trying to avoid
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.280]   the politics of this, but in my experience, the kind of people that I want for neighbors
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.960]   are usually the kind of guys and gals that immigrate from Mexico to the United States
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.120]   or from Guatemala to the United States.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.880]   They are hardworking guys and that the amount that most guys have overcome – I mean, you
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.760]   got to speak Spanish in order to get them to trust you enough to tell you the story.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:41.120]   But the amount that those guys pay to get brought in across the border and the pressure
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.560]   that puts on them, I mean, they are the hardest working guys.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.360]   And they understand why they're doing it.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.080]   They're the classic immigrant mentality.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.800]   I'm going to go to the United States where I can make more money.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.880]   I'm going to bring my family as soon as I can.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.240]   And by the time a guy is ready to buy a house, he's going to have paid off the fees that
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.680]   he paid to get across the border.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.880]   I mean, it's thousands of dollars.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.480]   Even coming across illegally, it's virtually impossible for most of those guys to get into
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.080]   the United States legally.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.200]   It's just – it's impossible.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.560]   But even if they're coming across illegally, it's still thousands of dollars that they
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.680]   will pay to the people who facilitate that process.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.160]   And so by the time they're coming to you and buying a house, they have paid off that
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   debt.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.480]   That's the first thing that they do.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:34.080]   They will often have paid – done it again to try to get their family back together.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.360]   And so they're going to be at a point where they're fairly stable and able to do it.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.680]   And they're going to be – I mean, they understand the value of what they have.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:46.040]   And immigrants, illegal immigrants are abused day in and day out.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.840]   And so when a guy comes along, treats them fairly, gives them the opportunity to own
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:57.800]   a house, rent to own is perfect, 10% down, higher rates, you're perfectly legally and
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.200]   morally justified in my view to charge them higher rates for owner financing because of
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.080]   the additional risk.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.800]   But when it's a lot – it's cheaper than often what they can get for financing on real
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.480]   estate in other places.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.280]   So it's a really good deal.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.880]   And I'm glad that it's working out well for you.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.760]   And I love to see just people treating those guys fairly.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   They need the help.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   Well, good deal.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   I appreciate it.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   All right.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   My pleasure.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.680]   We go on to the state of Iowa.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.680]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.680]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.680]   This is Tanner here.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   Tanner, go ahead, sir.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   I guess just a little bit of background on me.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   I am 25.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   I just got married last year.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   And I'm a CPA.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   Great.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.960]   So yeah, I guess I'm just calling just a little bit more for general life advice here because
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   I'm so young.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:02.520]   I guess I think I'm struggling just a little bit with direction as far as career-wise.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.200]   What would you tell your 25-year-old self?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.220]   Do you like the work of a CPA?
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:13.760]   Do you like the business model of a CPA?
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.320]   I like the people.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.200]   Okay.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:26.400]   So as I see it, having a CPA license is an ideal foundation on which to build a career.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:34.800]   But the normal career track of an everyday accountant is usually not particularly exciting,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.720]   and it usually doesn't result in you making all that much money.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:45.000]   But there are ways that you can build on that normal career track to really build some excitement.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.040]   And so I think it's an ideal kind of foundation to have for a young guy, 25 years old, newly
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.040]   married.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   I've got a CPA license.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.840]   Do you have your own practice or do you have a job?
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.160]   A job.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.760]   But there's some opportunities to buy in within the next year.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.580]   So let's talk about a couple of different career tracks that you can consider.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.960]   Career track number one is what I'll just simply call kind of the ordinary common everyday
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.000]   career track of a CPA of self-employment.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.400]   There is nothing wrong with this career track and it can have certain benefits.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.080]   You can start a tax preparation business.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.440]   You can start a bookkeeping business.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.960]   And you can start to attract your own clients to that business.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.880]   It's a business that takes some hustle at the beginning to get going.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.960]   But once you've got a stable body of clients, you can build something really phenomenal.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.860]   It's a good business.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.280]   One benefit of the business is that it can be seasonal.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:50.540]   Many CPAs obviously work all year long and they don't take much time off.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.520]   But you can integrate the seasonality into a more interesting lifestyle.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.760]   If you build your work time primarily around the seasons, if you have more tax preparation
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.800]   clients rather than bookkeeping clients, then you can work heavily during those seasons
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.240]   and have a lot of time freedom during other seasons.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.320]   It's a really rewarding job because you have a good demand, but you also have a high degree
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.320]   of flexibility.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.240]   You can digitize the business.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.680]   You can do most of your work virtually.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.060]   You can build a referral network in many different industries.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.640]   You can choose to target one specific geographic area.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.480]   You can target an industry.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.280]   You can target a certain type of client.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.360]   There are a lot of areas that you can specialize in and you can build a nice business.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.640]   Let's say that that and you can do it in a couple different ways, right?
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.240]   You can build it in a solopreneur approach.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.120]   Maybe you and one part-time bookkeeper, you and one assistant type of thing, very small,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.600]   flexible business provides a great living, right?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.220]   You can have a six-figure living, maybe $100,000 to $200,000 a year would be normal in terms
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:56.640]   of earnings, somewhere in that range, which is a healthy living and with the other benefits
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.960]   you can do that.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.600]   Now you can take the CPA and you can use that as a foundation for other kinds of business
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.780]   approaches.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:11.200]   When you are an accountant and you have passed your CPA exam, you can use that as a foundation
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.600]   to say, "I have a high degree of financial intelligence," and you can start to apply
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.640]   that to business investments.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:23.080]   I have known a number of extraordinarily successful businessmen who started as accountants and
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:29.640]   CPAs, but you need to usually decide that you're going to do that and that you're not
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.080]   going to stay in the comfortable space of working as a CPA.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:40.040]   In my experience, personality-wise, most accountants would tend to be more risk-averse.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.160]   They would tend to be more conservative.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.880]   They tend to be less people-oriented people, right?
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.040]   More of people who like the numbers, like the spreadsheets, etc.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.000]   And so if you're not that, like if you really like the people, you can turn that into entrepreneurship
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.240]   and say, "Okay, I've got a foundation.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:06.280]   Now how can I build a local business that is going to really open up and pave the way
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:12.800]   forward for me to really invest into bigger deals?"
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.600]   And so having a CPA license that hangs on the wall of your business, whether it's a
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.400]   local franchise, a local business, a factory, a school, who knows, I think it's really,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.040]   really valuable.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.680]   And it gives you one of the powers of a CPA is that accountants and CPAs don't have any
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.520]   of the baggage that other, they have almost none of the baggage that other financial professionals
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   have, right?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.760]   I have a certified financial planner plaque that I could put on my wall.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:46.000]   And that gives pretty good professional recognition.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.960]   But there's so many difficult relationships that people have with financial advisors that
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.800]   they're still like, "Well, I'm not so sure.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.040]   What's Joshua going to sell me here?"
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.360]   If I just have certified public accountant on my wall, people immediately assume this
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   guy is a total expert and he's not a sales guy.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.480]   And so you can build that really powerfully and you can apply that into any other business.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.000]   I skipped over the job, right?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.760]   You can work and get a great job in the corporate world if you like that.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.840]   You can get a corporate, a great job just simply working in a CPA business, becoming
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   partner.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.880]   Those paths are all sketched out for you.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:25.400]   And then finally, I would just point out that as a CPA, you can also take that and leverage
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.520]   that into many different areas of other businesses, right?
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.440]   When I, a good guy here would be, look at Mark Kohler, right?
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:40.080]   Mark Kohler is an attorney CPA, but he's built a good business practice with people doing
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:46.040]   legal work, people doing legal work and doing accounting work.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.680]   But then he's got this huge information business, selling books, selling courses, etc.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:56.260]   And so if you like the business, I would recommend you do that and incorporate an information
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.600]   and consulting practice into your CPA work as well.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:07.880]   So as I see it, having knowledge in accounting and having a CPA license is a phenomenal foundation
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.520]   upon which to build your career.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.860]   And it's just up to you as far as which of those kind of paths appeals to you more.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.160]   You don't have to stick with any one of them.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.120]   You could stick with what you're doing now for a couple of years.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.320]   You can go to law school, get yourself a law license, do something like Kohler has done,
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:29.880]   go and start buying a local franchise or buy out a local business and start using your
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.380]   business skill and building your skills as an entrepreneur.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.080]   Any of these options are open to you.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.480]   - Okay, wow.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   Thank you so much.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.320]   Yeah, I'm gonna have to listen to that back.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   There's a lot in there.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   - Good, good.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.780]   - Yeah, just recognize that your investment and the time and the knowledge is good and
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.240]   you have a good stable job.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.240]   Perfect.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.840]   Now, where do you wanna go from here?
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:59.600]   I will encourage my children to learn the skills of accounting, to consider getting
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.760]   a, this is one of the ones on my list, learn the skills of accounting and possibly get
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.480]   a CPA license.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.360]   It's easy enough to do and it's one of those good professional licenses that really serves
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.880]   as a foundation.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.840]   So use that foundation and then go on and see what it opens up for you.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.080]   There are lots and lots of options available to you.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.000]   All right, we go on to Toledo, Ohio.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.520]   - Hi, Joshua, can you hear me?
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   - Sounds good, go ahead, please.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   - Hi, this is Alex.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:41.240]   My wife and I, Danielle, have consulted with you before and we've done just exactly as
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.600]   you said we would.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   We've just continued to grow wealth and with COVID and everything last year, I basically
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.800]   busted my keister and now I'm basically, my role has become remote and I'm absolutely
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.680]   loving having the littles in my life with obviously the struggles of working from home,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.400]   learning to adapt.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:08.080]   But it's been quite an experience and I just can't thank you enough for your advice in
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:15.640]   the past and listening to your podcast, it's been very, very, very beneficial to myself
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:20.320]   and my family and just wanted to, first off, thank you for that.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:26.080]   My question today is rooted around basically us trying to get to that next stage of life
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   and purchasing a home.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.120]   We've been saving very diligently over the past few years now.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.160]   We're living in a condo that we rent from a family friend at a very generous rate given
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   our area.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.000]   So we've accumulated quite a large sum of money.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.700]   But it's just been difficult for us to pull the trigger in the market that we're in today
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.640]   with just how inflated everything is.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:45:00.400]   We've been considered looking at land and trying to purchase land and then possibly
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.240]   build maybe live around because things just, again, seem so grossly inflated right now.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:13.480]   Do you have any advice on, is it worth it for us to dump today's money at today's rates
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.600]   now or is it worth it to try to wait and see where the next couple of years may go?
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.680]   Brett, just so you have an understanding of our living arrangement, the condo we're in
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:28.960]   right now is technically a two bedroom, but I converted an office that was upstairs into
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   a nursery.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:35.240]   So we've kind of made it like a three and we have two littles, one that's just over
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.480]   one and the other that's approaching three.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.760]   So children of that age do not require a lot of space.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:45.240]   So we've been able to condense and over the past five years or so make it work.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.080]   But we're definitely starting to get a little cramped in our shell and I'd like to move
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:55.240]   on to the next stage and purchase a house and take those next steps.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.640]   Do you have money saved?
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.920]   And if so, how much?
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.680]   Probably a little over $150,000.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.720]   And how much do you earn per year?
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.920]   Do you want myself or?
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.560]   Total family income?
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.840]   I would say probably around $180,000.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.120]   And do you have any outstanding debts?
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.360]   No debt at all.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:34.960]   So first of all, financially, it's obvious that financially, yes, you can purchase a
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.400]   house.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.360]   So this is more not a question of whether you can afford it.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.800]   This is more of a question, is this the best thing to do at this stage in your life?
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:55.640]   So tell me, how would owning a house improve your life and lifestyle?
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:03.600]   So I believe the first issue that we've come across is just space in general, space for
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.400]   the kids to play because basically the one main room we have on the main floor is a hybrid
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:16.640]   between living room, dining room, kitchen, it's kind of all in one.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:23.160]   And granted, we've made it very friendly for them with all the kids stuff that comes along
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:28.440]   with children of this age, but it's always a constant battle between trying to keep the
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.560]   place somewhat clean and have space versus allowing them to do what children should do
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.320]   is just play and use their imagination.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.080]   So space has been the primary issue for us.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:45.120]   We've considered, okay, we could leave our current condo and maybe rent a house or something
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.000]   versus having to buy.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   But I'm just, the cost benefit analysis of going to a larger place at probably much higher
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   rate than what we pay.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.720]   I mean, we pay out the door $10,200 a year for living costs for just rent alone, rent
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.120]   and I guess basic utilities, water's included.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:12.800]   So it's relatively cheap where we live and the association is fine, the little condo
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:20.640]   is fine, but aspiring to have something larger, a larger place for the kids to play.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.200]   I mean, we adventure around to the local parks or whatever, but it would be nice to have
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:32.280]   a large fenced in backyard to allow them to play, et cetera.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.200]   So you are now working completely remote.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.440]   Is your wife still working in the local area?
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.160]   She is, yeah.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   She's in the local area.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   She's within healthcare.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.040]   So she's actually dropped down after we had our second child, she was able to drop down
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.480]   to 20 hours a week.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.640]   So I'm basically fully remote.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:57.240]   Essentially, I have to go to the office maybe once or twice a month for larger meetings
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:03.640]   or conferences or if they need me for an engineering endeavor, I show up to the office for those.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.720]   But otherwise, I'm basically remote.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:13.240]   In your area, if you bought the kind of house that you felt would be suitable for your family,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.000]   about how much money do you think that would cost you?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.960]   Probably in the ballpark of 400 to 500,000.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.720]   And what city is this?
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:31.400]   Roughly the city in which we're looking to build or buy.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.880]   Yes.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:41.040]   Northville, Plymouth, or Canton, primarily are the three towns or townships we've been
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.040]   looking in.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   So this is the state of Ohio.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.240]   And in your area in Ohio, you can't find...
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.240]   Not Ohio.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.240]   Not Ohio, it's Michigan.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   Michigan, okay.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   I actually live in Michigan.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   I just have a legacy number.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   That's fine.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.240]   All good.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.240]   So that's what I was trying to figure out.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:02.360]   So in your area of Michigan, you couldn't find a suitable house that would be a substantial
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:08.200]   upgrade on your condo and provide you with more room that would be a comfortable lifestyle
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:14.280]   for $250,000 right now in the market?
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.320]   For 250?
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:25.840]   We've looked, but relative to our market, it's just...
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.800]   At that sort of price point, it's a house that's so outdated, I know how much work that
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:36.480]   I would have to probably put into it to get it to an optimal living standard, I guess
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.480]   I would say.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:46.280]   It's just surprising to me because in Miami, Florida, I can buy a very nice house for $500,000.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:51.560]   So it's surprising to me that the difference between Michigan and Florida in your area.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.000]   Now you know the local market, I don't.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.800]   So that's a little surprising to me.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.680]   So let's talk through your options.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.640]   Number one, can you buy a house?
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.080]   Obviously you can.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.120]   You have lots of money saved, you make a high household income, you can easily and comfortably
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.180]   afford to purchase a home that is more comfortable for your family.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.200]   Is that a good idea?
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.360]   Almost certainly yes.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.680]   Almost certainly yes.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   Why?
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:22.440]   Number one, at this stage of life, you will be able to appreciate the space much more
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.480]   than previously.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:30.280]   You'll be able to appreciate what you're doing, the time, the family time.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.400]   It'll provide a good grounding for your family to say like, "This is our family home."
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.180]   You'll be able to enjoy some of the many benefits of home ownership.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.480]   You can make the home how you like it.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:49.320]   You can have the joy of building equity, of having kind of all the benefits of home ownership.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:55.600]   And almost certainly 10 years from now, if you buy a good house, a wise house that really
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.760]   fits you, almost certainly this is going to be a great financial move.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.560]   Almost certainly.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.160]   Purchasing your own home and owning your own home is a good thing.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:09.640]   And you guys are in the place where you can easily and comfortably afford it.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.520]   So is there any hesitation whatsoever?
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:21.600]   I think the hesitation is just whether you are content with that normal traditional path
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:28.760]   of good traditional money management, or whether you want something a little bit more aggressive.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.000]   And if that more aggressive path fits into what you're doing.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.980]   I would guess that almost any house that you purchase, especially if you need to buy something
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:46.160]   in the $400,000 to $500,000 range, you're going to be paying more than $10,200 per year
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.240]   of pure expenses.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.960]   I mean insurance, interest, tax, I would guess.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.600]   Now I don't know that for certain.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.160]   You should test that and find out.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.400]   If I go and buy a $400,000 house, let's say you do an FHA loan, you put down a modest
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.040]   down payment, how much would you actually be paying in pure expenses?
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.160]   I would guess it would be much more than $10,200, something more than $10,000 a year.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.920]   But perhaps your insurance rates are extremely low in that area.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.880]   The interest rates would be modest and your taxes are low.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.360]   That's possible in the Michigan area.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.160]   I don't know your market.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:26.240]   But if you had an aggressive path towards financial independence, then buying a house
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.380]   may not be the best plan.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.120]   Maybe you said, "We're making $180,000 a year.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.220]   We're spending $40,000 a year saving every single dime we can.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:40.000]   And our dream is to move to Portugal in four years and set up kind of a remote lifestyle
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.400]   living in Portugal as semi-retired people."
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.240]   Well, in that situation, I would say, "No, don't buy a house.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   Stay with a rented apartment.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   It's inexpensive.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.980]   You can deal with the frustration of the small space for a few years and you've got an aggressive
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.720]   financial independence goal."
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.200]   I haven't heard you say that, but if that is your goal, you should consider it.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.240]   Now what else could you do?
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.320]   Well, you could say, "I have an aggressive career plan, a career goal.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.400]   We're earning $180,000 between us now, but I'd like to make more money."
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.640]   In this situation, I think that often owning a house is one of your bigger impediments
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.440]   towards career flexibility.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:19.720]   Many people earn far less than they're capable of because they own a house.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.340]   And thus, they don't look for opportunities to move for a better job.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.240]   They don't aggressively and actively grow their careers because they're tied to one
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240]   place.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.360]   Now, if you want to be aggressive in your career, I don't know what your share of the
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.080]   income is, but let's say you're making a hundred and – if your wife's at 20 hours a week,
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.360]   maybe you're making 120 and she's making 60 or 50 or whatever.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.360]   Right?
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   Well, if you want to go –
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.360]   That's about right.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   Good.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   So 120.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   If you want to say, "You know what?
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.480]   I've been doing well at this and I like my career.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.880]   I'm well suited for it.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:54.680]   My goal is four years from now, I want to be making 320, not 120."
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:59.440]   Well, in that situation, you're probably not going to do it in your local area.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.320]   You're probably going to need to be more aggressive in your career search.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:07.280]   And so in my experience, this is the most disregarded area of financial planning.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.080]   People don't actively build their careers, but when they do start doing it, there's usually
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.340]   going to be a geographic move involved.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:19.200]   So are you the kind of guy who if you could facilitate a job offer over the next three
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.480]   to five years for $320,000 a year, are you the kind of guy who would move to take that
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   job offer?
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.360]   If so, you might be better off just simply renting, but renting a bigger house than buying
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.000]   something, perhaps.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.200]   Now, what's the other side?
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   You say, "No, Joshua.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.880]   Listen, we like it here in Michigan.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.720]   Where our family is here, our friends are here.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.000]   I'm content with my career.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.240]   I might take some promotions, but I'm not going to do this aggressive thing.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.400]   I'm not going to move from here to Dallas or from here to New York City just to make
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   more money.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   We like this.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.360]   We like the Michigander lifestyle and we want to stay here."
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.360]   Totally fine.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.360]   In that case, the weight is on your buying a house.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:02.080]   The third thing that you should consider is, am I buying a house for now or am I trying
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.680]   to buy a house forever?
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.680]   Now, obviously forever is a very long time, but let me explain.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:14.520]   The biggest regret that I have from my younger years is that I did not intentionally buy
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:20.480]   a portfolio of houses for me to live in using the Nomad real estate strategy.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:26.840]   Now, there are a couple of real estate strategies that have acquired some names.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:31.040]   The one here, the Nomad strategy basically goes like this.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.640]   You buy a house and you move into it.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:39.920]   You finance the house with a residential mortgage, just a standard everyday house purchase.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.720]   You live in it for the amount of time necessary to fulfill the terms of your mortgage, usually
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.240]   about a year.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:51.040]   And then after a year, you get some renters for that house and you go and buy another
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.320]   one and purchase another one.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.120]   Your renters move into the house.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.540]   They pay off your mortgage for you over time.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:02.740]   You repeat this process the number of times that you want to until you own the number
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:07.860]   of houses that you want or need to to fulfill your long-term investment goals.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.660]   And I love this strategy.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:16.680]   And for a guy like you with a high six-figure, almost multi-six-figure household income,
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:22.880]   with stable W-2 employment, and with lots of cash and no debt, this is a perfect wealth
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.860]   building strategy for you.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.620]   And it's a very low-risk wealth building strategy that you can implement.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:35.280]   The biggest cost to you is the frustration and the hassle of moving regularly.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:40.100]   Now, if you're coming from a small apartment, I would say you can certainly do this.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.520]   If you're thoughtful, you don't acquire too many things, and you just go into it knowing
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.880]   this is the plan.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.820]   So if you really care about big long-term wealth building, what I would encourage you
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.260]   to do is not try to say, "I'm going to buy the forever house.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.860]   I'm going to buy the half a million dollar house with a water view and a nice little
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:00.580]   lake and a community with a good school system where we're going to be for the next 20 years."
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.060]   If that's what you want, you can do it.
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.060]   You can afford it.
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:07.900]   But what I would love to see you guys do is say, "Our goal is to accumulate five houses.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:13.420]   We've got very young children, and so we're going to buy traditional three-bedroom, two-bath
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:20.860]   houses with a two-car garage and a backyard in a safe, traditional suburban neighborhood."
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.020]   And you go in, and you just start doing that.
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:27.620]   And your goal is buy the house, first house, with the minimum money down that you can get
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.340]   good terms on for your mortgage payments.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.300]   Put down the minimum amount of money, move into it, live in it for a year, and then buy
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.300]   another one.
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.500]   Move into it, live in it for a year, buy another one.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.500]   Rent these out.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   It's 12 o'clock.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:47.640]   And then after about four years, maybe five years, you now own five houses.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.260]   Then go ahead and move into the bigger house.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.260]   And then over the coming 20 years, let your tenants pay off the mortgages for you.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:58.140]   If you have excess cash flow, then you might pay off the mortgages one by one.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.700]   20 years from now, you'll be in a situation where you have, say, five rental houses all
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:06.300]   paid off, providing you with a good rental income, and you'll be in a really good situation.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.820]   So I think that any of those options are available to you, and you and your wife will just want
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.180]   to think about, "Well, what fits our goals and dreams?
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.180]   Are we ready to have the nice house?"
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.620]   If so, you could probably afford it.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.660]   Do we want to be flexible to move for a better job?
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.340]   If you're going to do that, don't buy a bunch of houses in Michigan if you think you might
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.260]   wind up in Florida.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.380]   On the other hand, if you're willing to do that, and she'd be willing to say, "Let's
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.300]   move for a few years," then set yourself a target and say, "Let's not buy one house.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.340]   Let's buy three houses.
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:36.180]   Let's buy five houses, and then go ahead and buy that nice house on the lake."
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:39.260]   So just consider some of these alternative views and see if any of them appeal to you
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:40.260]   and your wife.
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:44.660]   >>Joshua Foer: I greatly appreciate it, Joshua.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:48.180]   That's one thing that we've been mulling over is the option of doing that.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:53.020]   Last time we consulted with you, we had discussed that, and we looked into a few of the different
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:59.060]   areas, because as with most major cities, there's areas that are worth trying to purchase
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:07.420]   a house of that scale and invest in and leapfrog, and there's other areas that aren't as advantageous.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:13.340]   So we've been trying to figure out which are the best areas for us to actually cherry pick
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.340]   from.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:20.540]   And just with COVID and this housing explosion and just the cost of even those houses have
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:27.300]   risen so dramatically that it's kind of pushed us away from it a little bit.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:34.340]   But we'll definitely revisit it and see if we can find something that works for the plan.
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.100]   >>Steve: My summary statement, to make it very clear, would be from my perspective,
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:46.020]   without question, you can afford a house, and you probably should buy a house.
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.980]   You will appreciate the space, you'll appreciate those things, and it'll make a substantial
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.300]   improvement in your lifestyle, and you can leverage it in many ways.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.540]   So hopefully that's a clear enough place to leave it.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   Let's stay in the state of Ohio.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.540]   Welcome to the show.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   How can I serve you today?
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   513 area code.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.540]   Yep, that's you.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   Go ahead.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.660]   >>Joshua: Thank you, Joshua.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:14.340]   You recently mentioned you had a conversation with President Veep Jadlata of Leverland.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.700]   I might have mispronounced the last name there.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.060]   >>Steve: When I asked him, hold on, hold on.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.340]   It was funny, right when we were sitting down to do the interview that you heard, I was
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:27.660]   sitting there, I was like, "Okay, now precisely please tell me how to say your last name."
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.340]   And he was like, "Josh, don't even just try.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.500]   Just don't even try.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500]   Just call me Veep."
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.100]   That was why I had that awkward introduction.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.420]   I'm like, "I'm here with Veep, President of Leverland, instead of a properly pronounced
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.300]   last name," because he wouldn't tell me.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.540]   He's like, "Don't even bother."
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.940]   My check was not up to snuff.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.820]   >>Joshua: You said that you actually had an interview.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.140]   Did you record that and publish it?
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   >>Steve: I did.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.140]   >>Joshua: Am I missing some...
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.140]   >>Steve: That was immediately prior.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.980]   I published it on June 3 into the podcast feed.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.260]   So since we're recording this on June 4, you may not have seen it yet.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.780]   But yes, it's there for you now.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.940]   >>Joshua: Okay.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.780]   Well, we might be recapping some stuff.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:13.220]   But as far as what you understand, can you rate the project of Leverland on a scale from
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:22.340]   novel proof of concept to is it just actually got some potential if they get some sort of
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.660]   agency as far as being recognized by other countries?
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:30.860]   And where do you see that agency coming from as far as...
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:39.060]   I'm assuming a very small GDP, not a lot of trade, not a lot of constituents.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:51.620]   Do you see this as a promising project that can be built upon and is just waiting on people
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.660]   that just take the risk, I guess, waiting for Mayflower?
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:01.100]   >>Steve So let's talk... yeah, I love the question.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.420]   I'm so grateful that you called in to talk about it because it's something that is really
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.580]   fascinating to consider.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.820]   And we simply don't know.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:17.460]   When you think about what is a country, what is a nation state, which are not synonymous
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.100]   terms, these can be very interesting concepts.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:28.060]   And there are a lot of so-called micro nations that have tried different things over the
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.060]   years.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.300]   There are today micro nations.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.860]   And so let's talk about land, right?
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.380]   Leverland, the current land is very small, the amount of land that they have.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.420]   But that's not necessarily a problem, right?
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:45.620]   That's not necessarily something that makes a nation.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.060]   There is a nation that does not have any land.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:53.780]   It's called the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta, something like that.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.500]   The Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:00.540]   And so this nation is an official nation, it's an official country.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.220]   It has observer status at the United Nations.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:08.820]   It's recognized by over a hundred countries all around the world.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.500]   But this country has no land.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.540]   It has a legacy.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.300]   It's 800 years old, something like that.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.540]   But it currently has no land.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.220]   It has a leased property on the island of Malta.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:24.380]   It has an office, I believe, in Rome and a building somewhere else, like a third building.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.780]   Now, is this a real nation?
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.260]   Well, yes, by many, many cases, it is a real nation.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:35.340]   But is it a real nation that provides all of the services that you might have as, say,
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.300]   a US American citizen?
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.160]   Answer is no, it's certainly not.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.660]   But there are lots of other nations that are small but do provide more of those services.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.780]   For example, the most common one to look to is Monaco.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.620]   Monaco is a real country.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.180]   Monaco has thousands of inhabitants.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:55.820]   Monaco has citizens that live there, that work there.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.300]   They have a bustling economy.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.380]   They have a prince.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.380]   They have a government.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   They have passports.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.820]   They have international recognition.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:07.020]   But they're extraordinarily, it's a small nation.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.060]   They have no military.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.920]   They have, the borders are totally open, even though they technically have them.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.260]   And so is it a nation?
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.620]   Well, yes, certainly.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.500]   What about other small countries?
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.620]   Singapore, right?
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.820]   Very small when you compare the land mass of Russia to Singapore.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.060]   Obviously it's night and day, but Singapore is a very real country.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:29.180]   So could this little island and a little bit of land out in the middle of, on the border
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.780]   between Serbia and Croatia, could this become a nation?
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   Certainly.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.620]   Now, what I thought was interesting, I've previously laughed off the project.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:41.300]   And by the way, you need to be, you should be skeptical of these projects because there
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.860]   is a long history of, what's the right word?
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.740]   There's an adjective that I'm wrestling for.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:53.020]   There's a long history of unique people.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.580]   I hate it when my language abilities fail me.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:02.740]   Of just unique people that are, iconoclasts would be one word we could use.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:06.580]   There's a history of iconoclasts saying, "I'm going to do this certain thing."
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580]   Right?
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.740]   You think of the history of sea land, for example.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:15.700]   The nation, the principality of sea land, where a guy goes out and he colonizes this
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:21.860]   offshore oil rig in the seas by, was it by England or Ireland, the Netherlands, somewhere
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:26.300]   in that area of the world, and creates the principality of sea land.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.780]   Well, okay.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:34.020]   He did his thing for years, sold passports for sea land, et cetera, but never went anywhere.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.580]   So certainly there's a long history.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:42.580]   And all throughout the world, there are hundreds and hundreds of small little, you know, Pogestan
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.420]   and Abkhazia and all these different little enclaves of people that started.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.600]   But then there's even places like Taiwan, right?
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.060]   So Taiwan, is Taiwan a country?
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.980]   Well, it's a matter of tremendous international debate.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.620]   And so people don't even believe that, many people in the world don't even believe that
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.620]   Taiwan is a country.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.680]   Is Palestine a nation, right?
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.720]   So what is a nation is actually a very difficult question to answer.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.920]   So could this little island and other strip of land between Serbia and Croatia, could
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.000]   it actually, you know, be a country?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.360]   Well, Vite would say it is a country.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.600]   He has diplomatic relations with Somaliland.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.360]   And as we said in the interview that you haven't listened to yet, here's Somaliland, here's
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.560]   a nation of 5 million people with borders, with government, with an economy, but still
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.280]   most of the world does not recognize Somaliland as a nation.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.640]   So is it or not?
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.120]   What I think, and then I'll go on for just a moment more, right?
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.360]   We're so tied to the land, to the concept of land.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.520]   Well here's the reality though.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:54.640]   A country like Liberland might get its start with a small island, but in reality, that
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:00.680]   particular country doesn't have to stay with a small island, right?
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:07.200]   He, Vite has organized and they have arranged the purchase or the lease, I'm not sure which,
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:14.400]   of a parcel of land from the nation of Serbia where they are establishing a free trade zone.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:22.000]   And so in that free trade zone, they have the ability now to expand the territory and
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.480]   they can build more parts of their nation.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.560]   And so even in terms of foreign missions, right?
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.880]   Vite has succeeded in attracting a team of diplomats for the nation of Liberland all
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.680]   around the world and they're establishing foreign missions in other countries.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.640]   There are communities around the world of Liberland people living together and building
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.280]   communities in local areas.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:49.040]   And so just because a nation starts very small doesn't mean that the nation can't grow.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.120]   And it doesn't mean that if the nation is going to grow that all of a sudden they have
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.200]   to start fighting a bunch of wars, which of course would be completely antithetical to
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.080]   the principles and philosophy of a nation like Liberland.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.920]   What's interesting, you start thinking about these topics all around the world, there are
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.720]   countries that are spread across the globe.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.720]   The United States, right?
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.920]   What does the United States have?
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:12.040]   The United States has the continental US, but then there is an exclave of Alaska that's
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.520]   completely separate from the United States, but is considered by everyone to be part of
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.560]   the nation of the United States.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.080]   And Alaska came via land purchase from Russia.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.160]   You have islands like Hawaii, but then you have other parcels of the United States.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.720]   You have the Marianas Islands or American Samoa, Puerto Rico, these different parts
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.200]   of the United States that are spread all around the world.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.120]   And it's the same with almost any nations, right?
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:46.920]   You got Russia, but then Russia owns Kaliningrad in Europe, which is part of continental Europe,
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.640]   completely separated from Russia, but it is Russia.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:55.500]   So a nation like Liberland, if they have people, they could buy land, they could expand.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.920]   The nation of Liberland today might be a few square miles starting from this island, but
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:04.360]   then the nation of Liberland for 20 years from now could be very different.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.040]   So the answer is it depends.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:11.720]   And it depends upon what the found, as I see it, it depends upon what the founders of that
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.260]   nation are able to do.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:18.240]   So what Vite needs right now is he needs people to be more involved in building the economy
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.360]   of Liberland.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.140]   He needs people to physically locate their businesses in the free trade zone that Liberland
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.840]   has established in Serbia.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.620]   He needs people, they've negotiated a community that they're building, and they've had an
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.260]   architect draw up plans for property.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.700]   And so he needs people to actually commit to building houses there and living there,
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.780]   etc., to establish the nation of Liberland.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:46.180]   It's great that they can have the houseboats right now and they're having parties and events,
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.180]   etc.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.260]   And I think obviously what else could you expect at this stage, but it has to continue
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.340]   on and grow.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.780]   And so I've thought a lot.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.300]   Do I believe that this kind of thing could have a future?
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.180]   My answer is yeah, I do believe it.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:01.380]   I'm not going to stake 100% of my future on this particular project.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:06.580]   Vite, as he's traveling around the world, he's not, even though he holds a Liberland
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:12.980]   passport, he's not traveling around the world exclusively on his Liberland passport.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.540]   He has his Czech passport, right?
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.260]   But he's still active and he's still building it.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:24.380]   And so the answer as to whether or not it could succeed will depend, in my estimation,
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:30.820]   on his and other Liberlanders' ability to attract people to their personal project and
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.340]   people's willingness to commit.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:36.740]   I told Vite about, I don't think he'd read it, but I shared with him a number of years
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:41.220]   ago I read James Wesley Rawls' novel called Land of Promise.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:46.820]   And I think it was his most poorly written novel compared to his Patriot series that
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:52.660]   was, even with all of its idiosyncrasies, was a much more well-written series.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.460]   But the concept of it was basically this concept.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:01.840]   The concept of that novel, Land of Promise, was that people would go take a very undesirable
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.380]   piece of land – in this case it was an undesirable desert in Africa – and committed people,
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.300]   people that were committed to the cause, would establish a new nation.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:15.580]   In Rawls' book Land of Promise, it was committed evangelical Christians and Jews that wanted
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:21.180]   to build a free state with a strong influence of Christian principles.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:25.180]   And so they go to this nation in the middle of nowhere and they start building the country.
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:29.460]   And they have to come up with new technologies to actually physically settle people there.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.500]   They came up with an unwanted piece of land between borders.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.020]   That was how the novel developed.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:37.720]   They sold citizenships in that passport and they came up with services that the country
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.980]   could offer.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.180]   And of course it was a novel, but that was where I first started thinking about it a
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:43.180]   number of years ago.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.620]   So I think it could work.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.040]   Is it going to work?
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   Time will tell.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.720]   If you think about the US-American experiment, there was a time at which you would have been
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:58.220]   laughed at if you thought that the United States of America could succeed and flourish.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.520]   You know, what, 50 or 100 guys are going to come together.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.180]   They're going to agree on these principles.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:07.060]   They're going to unite some delegates from all these different colonies and they're going
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:12.340]   to come together and they're going to face off militarily and fight off the largest army
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.340]   in the world.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:14.340]   Like, that's insane.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.640]   It's ridiculous.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.360]   And yet that's history.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.700]   And so I want to support it.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:26.620]   You know, I'm now, I've made my application for Liberland residency, waiting to see on
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.900]   the approval and everything like that.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.580]   I paid for it with Bitcoin, which is exciting to me.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:36.340]   And if I wind up sending them a few thousand dollars and nothing comes of it 10 years from
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:41.100]   now, I won't regret it a bit because I want to see people experiment with these things.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.660]   I want to see these concepts and these ideas grow because if you believe in the concept
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:48.740]   of freedom and right to self-governance, et cetera, then there should be an ability to
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:49.740]   do that.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:55.380]   And in the modern world, I think that we're going to see more and more nations start to
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:02.340]   compete with one another and there's no fundamental reason why 50 years from now, Liberland could
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.820]   not be a well-recognized country.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.240]   I mean, put it in conclusion, right?
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:16.460]   If Taiwan still fights for recognition, if you have, who was the actor that came out
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:19.660]   and apologized for saying that Taiwan is a country, like the ridiculous stuff this last
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:26.580]   year, if Taiwan, this independent powerhouse of a country, is still fighting the world
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.960]   for recognition of its status from China and every day is wondering whether China is going
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:37.140]   to come and occupy them again militarily, then a lot of these concepts are not as set
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.020]   in stone as you might think.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:42.340]   And largely it's a matter of what will people accept.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:47.940]   If somebody's going to accept that, you know, Nauru or Palau are independent nations, then
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.900]   why can't Liberland be an independent nation?
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.900]   But there's a whole lot of diplomatic work that's got to happen for that to happen and
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:15:00.020]   it'll depend on the community that's attracted to Veet's project.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.020]   What do you think?
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.020]   >>Jay: Right on.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:10.140]   I just recently been opened up to the possibility of checking it out, so I don't have a fully
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.140]   formed opinion.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:21.140]   I think I'm very interested in it and I see it almost as, this is probably the wrong way
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:30.420]   to say it, but a charitable move as far as it just sort of gives me hope that something
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:35.100]   like that is out there and the only way it's going to work is if people make it happen.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:44.500]   So being one of the first to make it happen in no way is a, you know, something you would
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:52.420]   recommend your average person, but it was someone with the capability of doing so and
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:58.620]   that sees a little bit of promise there or hope.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:10.780]   I think it's something that I'm willing to learn more about and I'm not sure if that's
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.300]   enough to go on there, but I also have another question if you've got time.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   >>Trey: Yeah, go ahead.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.300]   We'll do it quickly.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.300]   Go ahead.
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.300]   >>Jay: Okay.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:24.940]   As far as looking at C-State, which is like the opposite of a new country, it's more removing
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:31.100]   yourself from any country than going to participate in starting a country.
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:39.380]   And in that instance, you have, I guess, even less agency because it's you versus whoever
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.680]   would like to trespass on whatever you see your rights are.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.940]   If you are not associated with military or rule of law, I've heard some stories of like
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:53.620]   contractors working down even in Antarctica, you know, where you would imagine things would
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:17:03.180]   be somewhat civil, but where workers' comp cases or disability is just, you know, completely
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.860]   ignored because there's no jurisdiction.
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:08.540]   So who are you going to go to?
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:21.820]   So what do you see as, I guess I'm trying to say stepping into both of them, C-Stating
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:28.500]   and stepping into if you were to actually go and try and engage in commerce in this
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:36.380]   free trade area, you're sort of stepping into the legal void, obviously C-Stating more so
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:46.140]   than actually doing trade, you know, on land with somewhat of a government.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:55.340]   Do you see the risk of stepping into that extremely high, something that can be hedged
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:04.540]   against or more or less, you know, with proper planning, you know, you're good to go.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:08.300]   If you were to get involved with C-Stating, would you try to join one of the communities
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.660]   that's already trying to build such a project?
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.660]   Would you do this independently?
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.660]   Would you just, are you talking about you living on your sailboat bouncing around the
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.660]   world?
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.660]   What would that look like for you personally?
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:28.620]   As far as joining, I would probably join a community because I have seen instances of
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:35.220]   people setting up their own little floating domicile in international waters and just
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:42.220]   the closest government decides to come up with reasons why that can't happen.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:49.900]   So like I said, it's kind of the C-Stating alone is you versus potentially anyone.
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.500]   So I definitely would not go that route.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.460]   I don't have much of a formed opinion.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:01.740]   I think that all these ideas are interesting and I respect the iconoclasts and curmudgeons,
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.500]   that was the word I was looking for earlier.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.220]   I respect the iconoclasts and curmudgeons who decide this is for me and I'm going to
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.900]   be, you know, the guy who does this.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:17.500]   Perhaps it's my children, almost certainly it is my children, but I'm not quite that
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.500]   radical.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.860]   I don't, and I'm pretty bored by it, right?
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.060]   For me personally, like when I think about living on a sailboat even.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.860]   Someday I may do it, but honestly whenever I think about living on a sailboat I just
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:31.580]   think of total boredom and I'm like, "I want to go out and live on a sailboat and bounce
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:36.220]   around in some lagoon day after day after day and go from beach to beach to beach."
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.620]   Like that doesn't sound super attractive to me and appealing to me.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.980]   Most people it does.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:48.180]   And so seasteading, like there's nothing, there's no real freedom that I can't, there's
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:54.580]   no real freedom that I need to do that kind of approach that I can't get in a simpler
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:55.700]   way.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:01.700]   There are a few freedoms that are important to me and they're pretty basic and pretty
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:08.500]   easy to accomplish and I don't have any, and I have found the most practical of these is
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.860]   just simply the concept of PT theory or flag theory.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:17.980]   To me that's the most practical approach because I could live really almost anywhere in the
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:27.740]   world and because I'm not doing much that I require government approval for.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.180]   And so even people who do, right?
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.220]   If you want to do drugs, right?
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.580]   Go to a place where drugs are legal.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.980]   There's lots of places where you can do that.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.840]   You don't have to go and do drugs on your sailboat.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.580]   You can just go to a country where there's no problem.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:44.940]   If it's any vice that you're involved in, gambling or shooting automatic, this is not
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:50.020]   a vice, but you want to shoot automatic weapons, go to Belarus and hang out with some guys
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:53.460]   and shoot some automatic weapons or go and find someone who's got the appropriate licenses
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.620]   in the United States and do it there.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:21:00.060]   There's plenty of options available to do almost anything that you want to do without
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:02.720]   going to those extreme areas.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.300]   Things that are important to me, right?
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.300]   Are pretty simple.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:11.700]   I want to be free to educate my children in the way that I believe is best.
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.900]   Now I don't have to go offshore to do that.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:18.500]   I might need to move from Germany to the United States or from Germany to Mexico or something
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.620]   like that, but that's pretty easily done.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:26.200]   Whereas going offshore is a little bit harder.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.340]   I want to be able to say what I think is right.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:36.900]   But generally speaking, virtually all of the world has a significant level of freedom of
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.660]   speech and so I don't need to go and live offshore for that.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.480]   I want to be able to serve God and love my neighbor, right?
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.280]   But I can do that even in the middle of a totalitarian dictatorship.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.620]   And so for me personally, people are worried about medical freedoms, right?
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.020]   To put in your body what you want to put in your body.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:57.100]   You can do that in most places in the world without having to go offshore.
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:01.060]   And so I'm just not going to...
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.300]   Sometimes libertarians are an odd bunch.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:10.020]   And a lot of times people are so interested in the theories of libertarianism and maximum
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:14.740]   freedom that they get lost in philosophical analysis and they don't actually do anything.
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:19.700]   And so I feel like that's probably the case with things like Sealand.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.580]   Maybe it's things like Liberland.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.580]   And it's not strictly necessary in my opinion.
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:28.220]   I think that, at least for me personally, I've found that I can have pretty much all
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:33.900]   of what I want with multiple countries, PT theory, etc.
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:37.900]   And then, you know, frankly I could live pretty well in the United States too.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:42.500]   I'm much more open now that I know I don't have to live in the United States.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.900]   I'm much happier with many things in the United States now and I could live happily there
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.340]   myself.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.660]   So I love the experiments happening.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:57.980]   And if you look at the experiments, you know, a bunch of visionaries who want to do an experiment
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.860]   can wind up influencing the world.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:07.680]   Whether it's the founders of the United States of America, whether it's visionaries involved
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.680]   in other areas.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:14.860]   But I'd rather personally right now, for freedom, I'd rather personally be involved living in,
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:17.140]   you know, like I did in yesterday's show.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:25.860]   I'd rather be living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, working on how do I create systems of money
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:32.380]   and financial exchange that serve the tens of millions of inhabitants of Ethiopia in
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.560]   a way that the international banks just simply aren't doing.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.580]   And I feel like that will do more to encourage freedom than seasteading.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:45.220]   I'd rather be involved in the 3D makerspace community, teaching people how to print plastic
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.860]   guns in their basement.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:52.780]   That'll do a lot more for freedom than me going and, you know, necessarily, you know,
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.380]   settling in sea land or something like that.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:59.300]   So I guess I'm a little more practical than some others are at this point.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.300]   Being extremely unproductive.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:05.300]   But I love talking about it.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.740]   Thank you so much for calling in and giving me a chance to talk about it.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:14.300]   And I do hope personally to go, hopefully this summer or fall, I hope to go and visit
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.300]   Liberland.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.180]   And I'll talk about how the borders go and how the travels open up.
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:19.940]   We finish out today with Stephen in Maryland.
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:20.940]   Stephen, welcome to the show.
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:21.940]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.940]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:23.940]   Thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:24.940]   My pleasure.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:29.300]   Just calling in to get a sanity check on our current family of plans, making sure that
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:30.300]   we're on the right path.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:34.060]   You'll hear a lot of corollaries with the last caller from Michigan.
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:35.580]   So kind of give you a background.
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.060]   You know, I've been listening to you for a number of years now.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:42.940]   I've actually taken steps to implement a lot of the concepts that you talk about on the
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.900]   show, including insurance.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:50.900]   We're exploring potentially homeschooling our children, getting involved with real estate
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.900]   investing.
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:25:00.740]   And as of recently, I've been able to secure a 100% remote job situation for our family.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:07.780]   And my wife is taking the steps now to step away from work and become a stay at home mom.
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:11.020]   We have a lot going on, a lot due to the show.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:16.420]   So to kind of give you background on our plans now and where we're coming from, we have two
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:20.140]   children, a three-year-old and a one-year-old, both boys.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.420]   We've been living in our townhouse since 2013.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:27.900]   We're starting to feel a little bit cramped, not having a yard space that we're accustomed
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:28.900]   to.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:32.460]   You know, my wife and I grew up with very large yards.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:37.060]   And a lot of our family lives in South Carolina, and a lot of our family is moving to South
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.060]   Carolina.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.580]   So we're very connected to our family.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.700]   We want to stay connected.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:48.020]   And currently we have about a quarter million dollars in the bank, and we're about $50,000
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:51.260]   away from a million dollar net worth.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:54.780]   So we're considering selling the townhouse in Maryland.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:59.180]   We played around with the idea of renting it, but trying to rent it from South Carolina
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:03.220]   doesn't seem like a great situation.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.900]   So we're thinking about selling it and then establishing about six to eight months' worth
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.460]   of Airbnb contracts.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:16.180]   And so we were thinking about living in Florida near Disney World for four months, and then
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:20.540]   maybe four months of Airbnbs in the state of South Carolina to get a feel for the area
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:23.820]   and see where we would want to settle down.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:30.140]   And part of that move would include trading our very expensive Jeep that I bought pre-listening
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.140]   to your show.
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.580]   It's fully paid off.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:37.620]   Trading that in for a minivan, selling the second car, putting all of our stuff in storage,
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:42.260]   and like a pod situation, and then executing on that plan where we stay for four months
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:47.020]   in Florida and then four months of Airbnbs throughout the state of South Carolina.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:52.100]   Some concerns that I have with that plan that my wife also has with that plan is the Florida
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.820]   aspect of the Airbnb is going to be very expensive.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:01.140]   You're talking about spending my entire paycheck, essentially, take-home pay, after fully funding
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:03.740]   the 401(k)s and HSAs and stuff like that.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.300]   We would pretty much spend everything that we save.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:11.220]   Not a huge deal because we have a lot of money in the bank to execute a purchase of a home
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.220]   or whatever we decide to do after this trip.
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:17.220]   The other concern that we have is very short-term.
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.300]   We're talking eight months of Airbnbs, and then what?
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.220]   What if we don't like South Carolina?
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:26.300]   What if there's some things going on right now that maybe we can't live in South Carolina
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.100]   in terms of my job?
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.860]   So there's that aspect of it as well.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.740]   And then during this trip, there's a chance that my wife gets pregnant.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:40.300]   I think you've mentioned on your shows before where it's very important that she has a very
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:44.380]   comfortable space where she can do doctor's appointments and she can be comfortable.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:50.060]   And then, of course, when the baby comes, it's important to be in a long-term situation.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:53.740]   And then the other thing that we're concerned about is losing out on the rental income.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.140]   There's this question of do we rent?
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:04.940]   And what the long-term impact on our wealth and financial goals will result as this plan
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.820]   is executed.
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.460]   So that's the plan in a nutshell.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:14.580]   The other aspect that we're thinking of, and maybe this is a part two question that if
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:21.100]   we have time we can get to it, is we're interested in settling down somewhere sooner than later,
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:25.420]   if not Maryland, South Carolina, because based on what we learned from your show and some
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:32.100]   other shows, we want to start buying that portfolio of investment real estate.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:37.940]   And part of the plan there was to actually buy that dream house, that lake house or that
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:42.300]   beach house first as a way to...
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.340]   It's kind of like the nomad strategy, the nomad real estate investment strategy you
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.340]   just talked about.
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:51.780]   But rather than just traditional rentals, we thought, "Okay, if we buy that lake house
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:57.140]   or we buy that beach house first with good terms and conditions based on the mortgage,
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:01.900]   then we can potentially turn that into a portfolio that we live close to and then go settle down
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:04.820]   in the more traditional neighborhoods."
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:11.220]   So that's kind of part two of the question, but really just focused on how risky is it
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.140]   going to Florida and then South Carolina with six to eight months of Airbnb and not really
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.700]   having a long-term plan.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:25.820]   I could hear the hearts of four-wheelers and overlanders all over the world sink when you
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:31.980]   said, "I'm selling a Jeep and buying a minivan."
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.220]   People say, "Jobstone, what's wrong with you?
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.220]   Don't do it.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.220]   Don't do it.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.220]   No.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:40.540]   Tell Steven not to do it."
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:48.380]   So I do have some thoughts, and I think first of all that you should acknowledge that most
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:53.180]   of these, while it's important to talk them through and think them through, you have worked
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:57.820]   hard to put yourself in a situation where most of these things are pretty simple.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.980]   They're pretty easy to do.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:06.140]   All of these moves, you have enough money and you have income, and so you have the freedom
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:10.260]   to do any of these things that you want, which is awesome.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:15.020]   And I want to applaud you for doing that because a lot of times people who are in this situation,
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:19.660]   they don't stop and think about what they want or go explore for it or go and look for
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:20.660]   it.
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:21.740]   They often just say, "Oh, I can't do it."
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:25.420]   But you've worked hard, you've saved money, and you've worked hard to get a remote job,
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.820]   and so now you can do that.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.540]   I say, "Awesome.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:29.540]   Well done."
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:34.600]   Now, when you go to Florida, you mentioned Disney.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.500]   Is it important to you to be close to Disney the whole time, or is that just, "Oh, we'd
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.340]   like to go a few times," or do you want to be in Orlando or Kissimmee?
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:45.340]   Yeah, so it's funny.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:49.820]   We never really thought we were Disney people until we went to Disney.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:54.920]   It's one of those things we want to live in while we're there, be on a resort-style setting
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:59.500]   where we have the splash pad and all the amenities within the neighborhood, and then within driving
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:05.300]   range of the parks because during that time, there'll be Christmas, my son's birthday,
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:06.300]   and of course Halloween.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:11.340]   We thought, "Wow, wouldn't it be cool if we could go to the parks and really give our
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:12.340]   children that opportunity?"
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:16.620]   So close, but not on the gates or on the border.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.620]   Okay.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:18.620]   Yeah, it sounds awesome.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620]   It sounds really cool.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.060]   So the first thing that I think is obvious to me is, number one, you should probably
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.400]   spend some time looking into house-sitting.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.480]   If you have two children, do you guys have any animals?
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480]   We do.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.480]   That's what's making this a little bit harder.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:39.460]   So we have a chocolate lab, and so of course the price goes up when you look at Airbnbs
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:43.980]   with a pet.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.660]   No question, it goes up substantially.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:52.180]   So is there somebody who may be able to pet-sit for a few months where the pet is happy and
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:56.100]   they're happy, and you guys know that you're not abandoning your puppy?
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:00.260]   Is there a family member or somebody who could take care of the dog for a few months?
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.220]   I don't think that's going to be an option.
[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.220]   Okay.
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.800]   Well, then it's going to be more complicated.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:11.460]   First I would say house-sitting is not necessarily out of the range of possibility.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:15.900]   You don't need to do it, but you should think about it because house-sitting or pet-sitting
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:20.900]   might be something that you could do that could defray some of the costs over the course
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.260]   of a month or two.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.260]   I don't know.
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:27.900]   I would imagine there's quite a lot of demand in the Orlando, Kissimmee area for that kind
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:31.380]   of service, but you should look for it.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:36.260]   Number two, I know the Orlando area extremely well.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:40.060]   Depending on where you want to be, right, and what you envision.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.060]   Now you have the money.
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:45.820]   If you want to stay in a resort, you can stay in a resort, and that will come with certain
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:55.300]   things, but the area, the range of towns and places that you can live that is within easy
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:00.140]   driving distance to Disney is very high.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:01.860]   There are a lot of towns.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:05.940]   And so you might, if you're just looking in Kissimmee and Orlando on Airbnb, that's one
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:11.900]   thing, but if you start bringing in Claremont and Lakeland and Winter Haven and some of
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:17.040]   these other towns, then all of a sudden your options will be much, much bigger.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:21.340]   And so if you want to lower the cost while still being within easy driving distance of
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:25.660]   Disney, there are a lot of options available to you.
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:31.020]   They may not all be on Airbnb, but even Airbnb rentals, there will be a lot of them.
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:35.900]   And now, will it provide you with a resort, splash pad, et cetera, all that?
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.340]   You'll have to look at the amenities of each individual community and judge exactly what
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.340]   you need.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:46.520]   But you're not restricted to what you can find on international drive, right?
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:52.740]   You don't only have to rent a house in, what's the name of the community?
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:59.540]   There's like a own developed by Disney, this awesome community that, anyway, it's like,
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:03.060]   it'd be cool if I could summon the name.
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.700]   Anyway, Celebration, there we go.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:05.700]   I knew it had it.
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.500]   You don't only have to rent a house in Celebration.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:12.140]   If you're not familiar with Celebration, it's this really phenomenal community that's very
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.980]   close to Disney.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.980]   It's awesome.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:16.180]   Really, really neat place.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:20.100]   But you're not restricted to renting a house in Celebration to have easy access to Disney.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:23.240]   You can be 30 minutes away in Winter Haven.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.040]   You can go north, you can go south, you can go east, you can go west.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.980]   And they're all within easy striking distance.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:35.420]   Anywhere along the I-4 corridor is totally doable.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:41.220]   So if you want to defray the cost a little bit, you should consider that strategy.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:46.660]   I think the other thing that you should consider is, and again, this won't fit with your, with
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:56.460]   your, your resort idea, but you should consider just simply having in your back pocket a little
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.680]   bit of camping.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.180]   If you've got a Jeep, then you're probably the kind of person who enjoys going back off
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.180]   roads.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:06.420]   You know, a teardrop trailer and a ground tent for the Jeep, a pop-up camp or something
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.420]   like that.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:13.760]   Florida is a wonderful place during the winter to camp and it's really beautiful.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.980]   And so if you're the kind of people who are at all outdoorsy, which I'm projecting that
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:22.080]   because of the Jeep, you might be a little bit outdoorsy, then that can be really interesting
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.080]   and fun.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:29.260]   Now it's hard work on your wife with children that young, but it is possible for you.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:33.220]   I affirm what you're saying from a financial planning perspective.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:38.340]   I'm convinced that you, you, when you come to a place in your life where you're thinking
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:43.120]   about making a change, you ignore the money, you ignore other investments and you focus
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.180]   on getting the people in your life right, the place right and then the work right.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.120]   And then you go back to the traditional financial planning.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:55.660]   And so the people that you mentioned are family members and I would lean on them a little
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.880]   bit in the process.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.540]   Could you see, is the townhouse paid off?
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:03.540]   Do you have expenses on the townhouse?
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:07.100]   Yeah, so a couple of clarifying points there.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.340]   Maybe I was a little bit unclear.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:12.600]   So the townhouse still has a mortgage on it.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.640]   It's relatively easy for us.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.160]   So our average expenses for the month, the household, I'm sorry, housing expenses for
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.240]   like utilities, things like that, it's roughly 2,500.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.540]   So it's really low in our budget.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:30.600]   And then, you know, looking at some of these Airbnbs, the price goes up, calculated up
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.980]   to be almost $7,000 a month, which is just crazy.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:42.520]   And then the $250,000 in the bank, I'm projecting based on the equity that we have in the house,
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.520]   that will be the cash that we have on hand for the purchase of a future house or multiple
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.160]   houses depending on the steps that we take.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.140]   But currently it's $90,000 less than that.
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:57.440]   But using the equity from the home, that will be the cash that we have on hand.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.840]   Right, right, right, right.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.840]   And you mentioned this resort.
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.840]   Let me just clarify.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:06.700]   When you picture resort living, tell me what you're picturing.
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:14.140]   So when I say resort living, it's mainly just a community that has amenities.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.940]   The splash pad for the kids, the home itself.
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:22.820]   You know, I don't think we really care if it's a townhouse or a single family house
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:29.860]   or like an attached duplex or something as long as you're looking at the pool that comes
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:30.860]   with the house.
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:37.700]   Typically it's, you know, screened in, it's got the covering and the patio.
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:44.340]   Maybe we're just really interested in having the amenities.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:49.620]   One of the reasons why we're so, you know, focused on getting out of our current neighborhood
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:55.260]   at the very least is we want to be feeling great in the house, but there's no amenities.
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:56.980]   There's nothing to do in the neighborhood.
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:58.460]   We're starting to get very bored.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:01.060]   We want things to do with our children.
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:04.940]   And so we kind of want to see what that lifestyle was like living in a community like that,
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:08.220]   that provided all of those amenities.
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.580]   Right.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:15.940]   Well, I would say $7,000 a month on Airbnb is a bit steep.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:20.940]   And while you could do it and you could afford it, certainly I'm not sure that you would
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:24.300]   enjoy it as much as you might think.
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:30.420]   What I would encourage you to do is expand your search around Orlando a little bit.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:34.520]   So the first thing I would do is I would look and say, okay, what can I, let me go a little
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:35.520]   bit outside of Orlando.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:41.140]   Let me look a little, little bit outside of Kissimmee and let me not look just on Airbnb.
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:47.820]   But what does a seasonal rental look like in, you know, Winter Garden or down in Lakeland,
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.380]   Winter Haven, Auburndale, Cypress Gardens.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:58.060]   These are all communities where you could come in and you could rent a beautiful, you
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:04.820]   know, a beautiful four bedroom house with a pool in a gated community for $2,500 a month,
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:08.740]   $3,000 a month with most of that stuff.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:14.700]   And then expand your activities to beyond just the Orlando area as well.
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:19.340]   Orlando is awesome, but it's easy to drive in from any of those places.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:27.420]   So anywhere along the I-4 corridor from Tampa to the East Coast is easy, is an easy place
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.740]   to be.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:31.940]   Anywhere north of Orlando you can find all kinds of options.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:34.820]   And so all of these within 45 minutes of the park.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:39.500]   And let's say that you went from a set of $7,000 a month on Airbnb to $3,000 a month
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.160]   for a seasonal rental.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.580]   And you can get a very nice three month rental on a nice house.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:49.220]   Well that leaves up, let's say you spend another $1,000 a month on actual hotels at Disney
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.420]   when you go.
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:58.380]   And the cost of Disney, you're still in the whole thing with just more options available.
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:03.660]   So consider that and see what you find.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.580]   I've lost any of the other questions that you had.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:09.740]   Did you have a specific question that I haven't covered?
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:20.460]   So the concept of your nomad real estate investment strategy, but sort of lake house.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.820]   Yeah, the VRBO aspect of it.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:31.420]   So buying that really nice lake house or beach condo first with the good terms and then potentially
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:38.540]   moving to a more normal suburban house that you would go to live in.
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:39.540]   Yeah.
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.180]   I love the idea, especially for someone who's going to work remote and especially with children
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.260]   the ages of your children.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:48.060]   I think that could work really beautifully for you.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.900]   The reason why most people don't do it is number one, of course, employment.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:56.020]   A lot of times the most desirable places to have a lake house or a beach house don't offer
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.560]   you the kind of employment that many people need.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:03.180]   Since you can work remote, then you can handle that.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:09.220]   The second reason why that often doesn't work is kids schooling and or kids social networks.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:13.720]   So with homeschooling, you shouldn't have too big of a problem with schooling, but even
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.820]   with regard to social networks and homeschooling co-ops and things like that, a lot of times
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:22.760]   those types of communities are more available to you in a bigger city.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.440]   So I like the idea a lot and I think it could definitely work.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.380]   You come in, you have enough money, you come in, you finance the lake house as your primary
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:36.340]   residence, you get good terms on that and then live in it, enjoy it for a time and then
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.820]   go ahead and put it out as a vacation rental and move to a place that might be more of
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.820]   what you're looking for.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.020]   Would you do that in South Carolina?
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.340]   Have you looked at any of the lake communities in South Carolina?
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.540]   >>Joseph: Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:54.540]   I mean, obviously with post-COVID and certainly it feels like a bubble that we're in.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:42:02.060]   It seems like it's just out of reach, but I'm sure things could potentially change.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:04.780]   Regardless of the price, I haven't really sat down and ran the numbers.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:10.620]   And so if the numbers work, even in an inflated market, based on the expected rental incomes,
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.620]   then it works.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.940]   It's just something that we have to look into.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:21.860]   But back to the South Carolina thing, the concern is we do this six to eight month Airbnb
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:27.780]   adventure, for lack of better terms, it's an adventure.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:33.380]   But what if the concern that my wife is having around potentially getting pregnant and not
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:37.420]   being able to find that long-term house, potentially we hate South Carolina.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:42.980]   And then we sold the house to Marilyn and me too, we're concerned.
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:43.980]   Okay, then what?
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:50.380]   Do we just keep up this Airbnb strategy or just find a long-term home and settle down
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:52.220]   for a year and figure it out?
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.740]   >>Dave: Yeah, you just rent a house.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:56.520]   My answer is you just rent a house for a year and figure it out.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.320]   It's not that difficult.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.060]   Most of this stuff is just a matter of ... There is certainly a concern, right?
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:08.220]   You want your wife to feel settled when that time comes, but you have plenty of time.
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:13.460]   She's not pregnant now, let's say she becomes pregnant immediately, then you have six months,
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:14.460]   right?
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:19.340]   Easy six months before you really want to be stable so where she can have everything
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:22.420]   in a comfortable position for herself.
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.660]   And so if you don't find something, then you just simply rent a house.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:29.740]   And you have enough money that this is not that big of a deal.
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:33.380]   And you're looking at areas where this is not that big of a deal.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:38.460]   And because you can work remotely and because you have money, even if you ... Let's say
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:41.220]   your family is all in Charleston.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.840]   Charleston is a wonderful town, right?
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.580]   You can easily find a rental that would fit your family and a very comfortable price based
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.600]   upon your budget and be close to your family members.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.020]   But in a worst case scenario, let's say you need to be 30 minutes or 60 minutes away from
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:58.820]   family just because that was where you found the house that would work for you for a year.
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:02.980]   I think you're in great shape and that this is not difficult.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:04.580]   It's not crazy.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.140]   It's not a hassle.
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:11.380]   Your money and your remote income will smooth all of these things out for you.
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:13.060]   I'm not scared of the plan at all.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.060]   Fantastic.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.420]   It's good to hear.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:16.420]   I appreciate it.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:20.260]   Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:25.420]   I guess maybe you've heard me say recently, it's only scary the first time.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:30.140]   And same thing with almost everything, buying, selling houses, renting this, renting that.
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.340]   It's really only scary the first time.
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.620]   And once you've picked up and moved and kind of bounced around a little bit, then you'll
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:40.620]   understand what's great about that and you'll understand what's not great about that.
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.320]   And my answer is just keep some kind of backup plan.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:49.540]   My biggest fear as a father with children, caring for my wife and children, my biggest
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.600]   fear is I get stuck.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:54.660]   And I get stuck in a place where I've got to rent something for $7,000 a month and all
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.980]   of a sudden I don't have the money.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:00.980]   So I always look for what's a backup plan in that situation.
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:01.980]   What are the backup plans?
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:03.780]   Number one is savings, right?
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:05.440]   Making sure you have money.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.460]   And then number two is flexibility.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:12.080]   So if I get stuck somewhere for $7,000 a month, okay, maybe this was great for a month.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.420]   We loved this Airbnb and the community with the fountain and all the stuff.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:18.620]   But something just happened.
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:24.000]   All right, let's go to an hour outside of Orlando and let's go where we can get a big
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.900]   comfortable house for $2,000 a month on a three-month rental and just kind of square
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.420]   things away.
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:34.820]   And by the way, one of the things that I think you could definitely do is find a place on
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.940]   Airbnb and/or use Airbnb as a listing.
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:41.740]   And of course this violates their terms of service.
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:48.060]   But find a property on Airbnb that you like and then contact the owner privately off of
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:51.780]   the platform and see if you can negotiate a three-month rental directly.
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:57.940]   And there are many Airbnb tenants, sorry, Airbnb landlords that would be happy to negotiate
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:04.520]   a three-month rental for you of just, "Hey, the Airbnb price would be $2,500 a month.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:10.040]   But if I just pay up front cash, would you take $6,000 for a three-month rental?"
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:12.300]   That gives you the time to stabilize your family.
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:15.480]   There's plenty of amenities in all of the communities around.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.080]   There are municipal splash pads in most places.
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:21.800]   There are community pools.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:22.920]   There's wonderful parks.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:27.880]   You have day trips to Weekee Wachee Springs and all the stuff available to you.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:30.080]   So I don't think it's crazy at all.
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:35.960]   The only thing that you want to be careful of is being stuck in $7,000 a month Airbnb
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.700]   rentals because that'll stress you out.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:40.760]   So I say use them, but then recognize that you're not stuck there.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.760]   You can go to South Carolina.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.280]   You can go back and forth.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.920]   The options are there.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.640]   And so that's the other reason why I like the camper option, even if it's just a temporary
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.640]   thing.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.920]   So let's say that maybe you go ahead and sell the Jeep, but maybe you...
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.320]   Because I think you'll have a much more comfortable trip with the luggage that you need with a
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.080]   minivan instead of the Jeep.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:02.960]   But keep a tent, a nice tent.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.080]   And Florida has some really wonderful parks.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.160]   And as a way of temporarily lowering the cost, and you got a one-year-old and three-year-old,
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:12.640]   it's a little young to really enjoy that.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:17.280]   But just keep something in your back pocket to where you have low expenses and more options
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.640]   available to you.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.640]   Sounds good.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:27.640]   I'll take that under advice and we'll execute and hopefully I'll see you and let you know
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.560]   how it all turned out.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.920]   Congratulations on all your success.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:37.520]   And if it doesn't turn out well for this particular one, recognize that you just simply rent another
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.320]   house or you buy another house.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.080]   There's plenty of them available and it's not that difficult to do.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.040]   That brings us to the end of today's Q&A show.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.240]   I want to thank you all for calling in.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.760]   I love doing these shows.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.480]   And as you see, where else do we talk about seasteading?
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.480]   Seasteading.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.280]   How's that for an out of the box conversation?
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.360]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.360]   Have a wonderful weekend and I will be back with you very soon.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.940]   (upbeat music)
