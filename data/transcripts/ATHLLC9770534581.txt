[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.240]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.120]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.360]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.440]   and today let's talk about one of the most important things
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.680]   we can all optimize, sleep.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.120]   So, whether you're someone who struggles with sleep
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.440]   or you just wanna strive for perfection,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.520]   this episode will go deep on the entire spectrum,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.080]   everything from environment, technology, food, drink,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.980]   exercise, and a lot more.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.720]   I am confident it will leave you with a few changes to make
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.260]   that will help you start waking up
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.520]   even more ready to take on your day.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.980]   When I decided to do this episode,
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.980]   I wasn't sure who to bring on as a guest,
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.580]   but huge thank you to three-time All The Hacks guest,
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.940]   Lee Rowan, who texted me immediately
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.020]   after listening to a talk about sleep
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.920]   from our guest today, Molly Eastman,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.220]   saying I had to invite her on the show.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.500]   Molly is the creator of Sleep as a Skill
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.100]   and also hosts one of the top sleep podcasts in the world.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.620]   She has a wealth of information
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.660]   and I'm so excited to be talking to her,
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.820]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.360]   I was walking through Costco recently looking for samples,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.020]   as we all do at Costco,
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.740]   and the last sample station was for an electrolyte drink.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.200]   But when I looked at the ingredients,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200]   there were 11 grams of sugar in each serving,
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960]   which is so crazy.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960]   But here's the thing,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140]   staying hydrated and replenishing electrolytes
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.400]   is so important.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.000]   Electrolyte deficiency or imbalance can cause headaches,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.840]   cramps, fatigue, brain fog, and weakness.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200]   Thankfully, our sponsor today is Element,
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.360]   and they help anyone stay hydrated
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.880]   without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.680]   found in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.520]   I've been using Element for the past year
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.280]   because there's a growing body of research
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.200]   revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.540]   occur at sodium levels
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.160]   two to three times government recommendations.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   And each pack is so small
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.380]   that it's easy to bring with you anywhere you go,
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.120]   you just need to mix it with water and it tastes great.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.000]   Personally, I love the mango chili.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.340]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.840]   to Navy SEAL teams to everyday parents.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.360]   And if you're not sure whether it's for you, don't worry,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.400]   because Element offers no questions asked refunds,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.520]   so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.320]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.560]   with any purchase.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.760]   That's eight single serving packets free
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.320]   with any Element order.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.160]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.120]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/element, L-M-N-T.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.040]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   You must go to allthehacks.com/element, L-M-N-T.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.580]   - Molly, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.500]   - Oh, thank you so much for having me.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.340]   - So excited.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.860]   Sleep is so fundamental
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.820]   and it's such an important part of our lives.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.500]   I constantly talk to people
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.260]   who aren't giving it as much attention as it deserves.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.420]   I just wanna know why is sleep so important?
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.380]   - Okay, so we really struggle to find a single domain
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.680]   of life that is not negatively impacted
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.640]   when our sleep is not working as well as it could.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.800]   And what does that mean?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.380]   So when you think about different domains of life,
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.180]   when you think about cognition,
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.020]   when you think about cardiovascular health,
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.360]   when you think about immune health,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840]   when you think about emotional regulation,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.140]   mental health, et cetera,
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.140]   the ripple effects are so vast
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.200]   from a negative side of things
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.340]   when we're not getting the sleep that we require,
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.900]   whether in duration, regularity,
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.680]   the quality of that sleep.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.840]   But then on the flip side
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.240]   from a more potentially positive spin,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.000]   we struggle to find areas of life
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   that are not positively impacted from a ripple effect
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.880]   when we do improve this area of our life.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.480]   So it really has the possibility
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.260]   to absolutely reach tentacles
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.560]   into your whole experience of your life.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.960]   And that's one of the reasons I'm so passionate about it.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.640]   - All right, so I think maybe to set a baseline,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.940]   'cause I'm sure we're gonna talk about
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.100]   a lots of parts of sleep.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.680]   Let's talk about like fundamentals.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.120]   What are the different stages?
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.300]   What's important about them?
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180]   Let's kind of set some understanding
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.060]   of sleep in general for people.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.660]   - So when we think about sleep,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.340]   some of the general rules of thumb
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.620]   that probably a lot of people have heard
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.940]   is that for a healthy adult,
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.980]   you're aiming for somewhere around seven to nine hours.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.100]   So that would be in the duration category.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.220]   And that's what a lot of people are thinking about.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.420]   So how much sleep am I logging?
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.780]   But it's about so much more than that.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.900]   So you can be someone that hits whatever,
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.520]   seven and a half hours every single night,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.720]   but it might be all over the place as far as regularity.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.360]   It might be fragmented.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.640]   So you might be taking a very long time
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.840]   to log that seven and a half hours.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.500]   So that can be problematic.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.440]   So we wanna get more granular
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   on what our kind of goals are with our sleep.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.040]   Also knowing that each individual
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.320]   is gonna have some bio-individuality
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.640]   on how much sleep they should be getting.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.960]   But there are certain components
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.480]   that we would like to have as far as consistency,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.920]   regularity, less of that sleep fragmentation, et cetera.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.200]   When we think about sleep stage classifications,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.560]   now this is where a lot of people
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.920]   start to go a little funky,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.640]   meaning that I have a lot of people coming my way
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.080]   and they're freaking out
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.920]   because they're tracking on Aura, Whoop, Apple,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.520]   Garmin, et cetera.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.080]   And they're saying, I'm not getting any deep sleep.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   I'm not getting any REM, et cetera.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.480]   So first off, when we think about those sleep stages,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.600]   the problem is that this is the least accurate data
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.240]   on our wearables.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.520]   So all the information that's coming out,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.600]   this is the least accurate.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.880]   And it's using its own algorithm within each wearable
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.480]   to make its best guess on, are you in deep sleep?
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.400]   Are you in REM?
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.440]   Are you in light sleep?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.680]   It's kind of how it's been boiled down
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.540]   to some of the generalized ways
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.640]   that we're thinking of our sleep.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.000]   And the problem is, because it's that best guess,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.720]   if the algorithm is changed,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.680]   your results with your sleep staging
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.980]   is going to be markedly shifted.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.200]   So I work primarily with Aura Ring
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.720]   from a consumer grade tracker perspective.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.600]   And just in 2023, a big algorithm change,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.160]   and there was entirely different results
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.800]   for many, many people on their deep sleep,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.560]   their REM, et cetera.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.920]   And if you were making decisions
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.000]   on those numbers beforehand,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.080]   you were really taken for a surprise
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.600]   when you got these totally new set of numbers.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.280]   So my big message for people, if they are tracking,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   is one, to not get too crazed about the REM deep sleep
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.160]   and your light sleep.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.440]   Instead, you can look from a trends perspective,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.720]   do not try to cross reference within wearables
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.360]   since they are using such different algorithms.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.160]   But within each wearable,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.360]   you can start to notice particular trends
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.840]   and see are there patterns that you can help support
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.080]   based on those trends.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.360]   And now, if we pan out even further,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.760]   some of the generalized things
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.800]   that I think have a practical application
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.120]   is just simply to know that on your first half of the night,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.000]   what most of us are looking for
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.360]   is a deeper, higher ratio of deep sleep on the first half
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   and a higher ratio of REM on the second half.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.960]   And what is important about that
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.080]   is even from a timing perspective,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   is that if you manipulate the time
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.800]   by which you're going to sleep
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.000]   and say you just decide to go to bed later
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.560]   on your Fridays, Saturdays,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.840]   and maybe into Sundays or what have you,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.200]   then you're lobbing off some of your possibility
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.440]   and potential to get deep sleep.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.240]   That's that first part of your sleep
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.520]   'cause the body likes to try to stay on time.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   So you're hitting some of your potential
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   to get deep sleep on the first half.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.320]   And then on the flip side,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.400]   if you're someone that's waking up earlier
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.560]   on certain parts of your week or what have you,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.720]   then you're cutting into some of your potential
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.240]   to get that REM.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.000]   And probably most people have heard
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.240]   of some of the importance of both of these.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.320]   Deep sleep, really, really crucial
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.840]   for some of our brain health,
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.760]   our reparative mechanisms, growth hormone, and more.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.440]   And then of course, for REM,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.760]   you can almost think of it as like your inner therapist.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.480]   So, so much from our cognition, our memory,
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.720]   our emotional regulation, fortitude, other things
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.440]   can all get impacted then if you are cutting
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.200]   into your morning timing.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   So this is what's so interesting about sleep
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.280]   is that there's a real strategy
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.400]   by which we can navigate what are we prioritizing?
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   And the least sexy thing about all this
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.760]   is one of the best ways to prioritize this
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.400]   and help facilitate it is consistency,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.360]   which virtually no one wants to hear.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.080]   But it's one of the most powerful things
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.920]   that can make such a difference with those ratios.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.800]   - For someone who's not tracking with a device,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.320]   is there a way to estimate how your quality of your sleep is
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.200]   or what you're getting?
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.840]   Is it about how you feel in the morning
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.400]   or how many times you wake up or something like that?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.760]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.200]   So if you're not tracking, for many, many years,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.760]   if you were struggling with your sleep,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.880]   you wanted to get a sense of like, how am I sleeping?
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.280]   People would do sleep diary or sleep log.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.640]   And so that's something you can do in a low-tech way,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.520]   just pen and paper.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.800]   And you can start tracking for a period of time.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.400]   What time are you going to sleep?
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.720]   So you're getting into bed.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.280]   And how long is it about taking you to fall asleep?
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   Then from that point, what time are you waking up?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.920]   But in between that time,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.840]   there's often for many people, a lot that might go on.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.160]   So they might wake up at three, four in the morning.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.120]   And if so, how long are you waking up?
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.440]   If you're really struggling with insomnia,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   kind of difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.000]   what are some of the thoughts that are coming up
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.960]   throughout that period of time
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.760]   so that we can just get a read
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.880]   on both your results with your sleep,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   but also your relationship to your sleep?
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.760]   Are you getting really thrown by some of these results?
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.560]   But then of course, to your point,
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.960]   so once we're tracking for a period of time,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.160]   it's like, what other information can we glean?
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.960]   Well, we can glean, what is our average bedtime?
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.720]   What is our average wake-up time?
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.200]   What are our average number of kind of sleep fragmentations
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.800]   or wake-ups throughout the course of the night?
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.480]   How long are we awake during that period?
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.760]   But then also, of course, the subjectivity,
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.000]   because even if you are tracking or aren't tracking,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.600]   what's your subjective experience?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.240]   So are you waking up really feeling very fatigued?
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.400]   Now, there is something known
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.320]   as sleep inertia in the morning.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.760]   You're back online, if you will,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.120]   'cause you've been in this altered state for hours,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.720]   and now you're coming back
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.880]   at a different level of cognition.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.720]   So you might have a little bit of a sleepy haze to you.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.280]   That's often normal, but is it really augmented
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.080]   or really a struggle for you to wake up,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.920]   go about your day-to-day activities?
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.480]   Are you finding that then you're consistently sleepy
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.640]   throughout the course of the day?
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   This can then get into questions
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.240]   of even beyond just sleep deprivation or poor sleep,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.960]   then possible sleep disorders,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.280]   which Mount Sinai just quantified it
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.680]   as that it appears that there's over 100 sleep disorders
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.480]   or sleep-wake disorders.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.960]   So there are a lot of things that could be undiagnosed
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.280]   that you wanna be aware of too.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.200]   Could you be dealing with that level of fatigue
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.600]   throughout the course of your day
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.160]   that could point to things
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.640]   like respiratory-based sleep disorders,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.400]   like sleep apnea, upper airway resistance syndrome,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.160]   or otherwise, and those can really impact
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.760]   the quality of your sleep.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.440]   Another big red flag that I see a lot for people
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.360]   in relation to your point around
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.000]   what else might we be able to tell if we're not tracking
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.840]   is are you falling asleep
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.560]   the minute your head hits the pillow?
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.920]   And I get this all the time.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.240]   People are like, "Oh yeah, I'm sleep.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.080]   "I'm good with that.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.280]   "I can sleep anytime, anywhere.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.440]   "Doesn't matter.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.280]   "I am out.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.640]   "I don't have any problems with that."
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.720]   But actually, that would be a red flag for us
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.400]   that something might be a problem
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.240]   because that can denote or be a sign of sleep deprivation
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.360]   or an undiagnosed sleep disorder
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.600]   because we do want a little bit
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.120]   of a sleep latency period of time,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   so kind of healthy sleep latency, if you will,
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.720]   and it will be bio-individual,
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.600]   but somewhere in the 10 to 15-minute range
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.720]   quite usually is kind of a healthy amount of time
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.640]   to go from an awake state down regulate
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.160]   into this totally different sleep state.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.760]   So if you're seeing that for yourself,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.120]   you're falling asleep really immediately.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.240]   If you're then having a lot of those sleep fragmentations,
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.800]   if you're waking up really tired,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.000]   also in the realm of sleep disorders,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.120]   are you waking up with dry mouth?
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.960]   Are you waking up with headaches?
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.520]   Things that might point to some of the things
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.400]   that you were doing throughout the course of the night,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.440]   teeth grinding, bruxism,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.480]   some of these sleep disorders that can really impact
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.840]   some of your sleep quality.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.360]   So there's a lot to navigate.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.640]   - Okay, so stages, a lot of the red flags,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.720]   stuff without data.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.000]   Where do sleep cycles play in here?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.720]   I feel like there was a time in my life
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.560]   where it was like, well, you need periods of 90 minutes.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.400]   Is this a thing?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.880]   Is that something we should discuss in advance?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.920]   - I get a lot of people that will come my way
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.800]   and they'll be strategizing about the sleep cycles,
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.280]   and it is very interesting
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.160]   because it's very true.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.240]   We will be navigating through these sleep cycles
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.840]   in a little different for each person.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   So it could be around these 90 minute timeframes
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.560]   is the popular amount of time that seems to be an average,
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.720]   but it might be plus or minus for each individual.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.960]   And the aim is to get through a number of these sleep cycles
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.240]   throughout the course of the night.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.920]   And yet I find that a lot of people are fixating
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   on some of the sleep cycles and strategies around that
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.120]   and missing some of the force for the trees
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.600]   on some of these other things
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.760]   that we can absolutely do to let the automaticity
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.160]   of that kind of come together on its own.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.760]   If we have these egregious sleep disorders
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.720]   that we're missing,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   that of course is gonna impact the workability
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.040]   of those sleep cycles of how you're oscillating
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.760]   through those throughout the course of the night.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.440]   But even beyond that,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.240]   one of the things that I'm often seeing just on the ground
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.160]   is so many behaviors that they're engaging
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.600]   in environmental elements, et cetera,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.480]   that are impacting their ability
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.680]   to navigate some of those sleep cycles effectively.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.920]   And then the last piece about the sleep cycles
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.840]   would be a number of people talk about
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.200]   wanting to be woken up
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.560]   in kind of that ideal part of their sleep cycle.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.360]   There's merit to that.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.720]   And one of the things that I find
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.600]   is the more we bring in some of these workable elements
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.720]   with our sleep,
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.680]   we really get dialed in on some of these components
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.480]   that often falls into place on its own quite frequently.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.520]   So that you don't have to have
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   the intervention of technology.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.280]   If people aren't familiar with this,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.600]   some people are looking to find pieces of tech
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.880]   that can wake them up at certain parts of their sleep cycle
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.400]   is the aim.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.280]   And you can absolutely experiment with things like that.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.040]   But I would also point to getting us aware
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.800]   of how many things that we can do while we're awake
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.920]   that can facilitate that those all work effectively.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.320]   - I love to highlight businesses
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.840]   that are doing things a better way
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.960]   so that you can live a better life.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.880]   That's why I love our sponsor today, Mint Mobile.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.520]   For example, a few months ago,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.520]   I got an email about our AuPair's phone line saying,
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.160]   "It turns out you don't need unlimited data.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.280]   On average, you're only using about seven gigs a month.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.400]   So switching to the 15 gigabyte plan
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.680]   will be fine and save you money.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.760]   And you can always upgrade back to unlimited if you need it."
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.640]   Who does that?
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.960]   I never get emails like that from businesses,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.040]   but I love it.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.880]   On top of that, Mint Mobile has ditched retail stores
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.680]   and all those overhead costs,
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.160]   and instead sells their phone plans online
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.480]   and passes those savings on to you.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.320]   For a limited time, they're passing on even more savings
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.880]   with a new customer offer

[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.480]   This year, I'm trying to level up everything,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.240]   and that includes my fitness routine and clothing.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.600]   The routine does require a bit of willpower,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.080]   but when it comes to the clothing,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.480]   our sponsor today, Viory, is making that so easy.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   Viory makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.480]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.720]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.440]   and it is so freaking comfortable
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.280]   you will want to wear it all the time.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.560]   I know because Amy and I
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.040]   are actually wearing Viory all the time.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   I've long said the Sunday Performance Joggers
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   were my favorite,
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.320]   but I wear my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.560]   almost as much.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.680]   But I really love that Viory keeps adding
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.800]   some amazing new collections of jackets,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.360]   sweaters, and more.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.800]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.840]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.560]   but they're also great for lounging
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.120]   and running around town.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.000]   Honestly, I think Viory is an investment in your happiness,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.440]   and for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.160]   And before we go too much further,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.720]   why is sleep so important?
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.840]   Can we talk for a moment about what's going on in the body,
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.960]   why we need it, why it's so valuable?
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.640]   We've been sleeping as human beings
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.320]   for centuries and centuries.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.240]   It is the one area of life
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.200]   that we have not been able to hack our way out of.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.000]   I know this is a podcast around all the hacks,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.520]   and yet we have not been able to figure out a way
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.600]   to cut out this very vulnerable part of our day
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.360]   when we are just asleep for a stretch of time
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.480]   for seven to nine hours for most people.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.000]   So why do we keep doing that?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.560]   Why is that so important?
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.400]   Well, one, we know that this is crucial
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.960]   for our immune function, cardiovascular health,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.000]   for our emotional regulations.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.520]   We know that it's also just so important for our waistline.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   That our whole experience of life is going to be colored
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.640]   if we don't prioritize this area.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.200]   And yet many of us don't even know what it can feel like
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   or look like to wake up consistently feeling well-rested
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.400]   and the crossover effects of what that can look like.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.280]   I'm excited to dig into all of these things.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.560]   I have a couple of random questions when it comes to sleep.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.560]   One is how different is this on individual basis?
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.080]   And I ask this because we've talked about seven to nine hours
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.520]   and I have this one friend who can sleep almost nothing
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.640]   all the time and then sleep for like 13 hours
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.480]   on the weekend.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.200]   Are there just some people wired differently
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.720]   that need different amounts of sleep
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.120]   that can catch up differently?
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.840]   Or is my friend just burning himself out?
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.680]   - It's a great question.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.720]   I get that one a lot.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.160]   So first off, it appears that we can have
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.080]   these particular coping mechanisms.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.480]   So your friend is a person that I see a lot
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.560]   where they come in, we look at their stats
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.680]   and they might have four hours, five hours,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.120]   six hours, then 13 hours.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.880]   And the problem with that is that that can save the day
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.080]   for a while and stretch of time,
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.640]   but eventually we'll see hits on a number of areas
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.480]   across the board.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.480]   So for men, we know that testosterone levels
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.040]   are massively hit when we do that on a stretch of time.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.840]   We had an expert, Dr. Allison Brager,
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.000]   who had come on as a representative of the US Army
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.600]   that found that there's a point of no return
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.200]   after doing this for multiple, multiple times
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.560]   because you're not able to bring about
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.000]   that hormone stability after this long, long stretch
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.840]   of doing these things.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.200]   That's like one example, right?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.840]   For the most people, what we find is that
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.200]   there's a reason we have sort of this U-shaped curve
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.000]   of the suggestion for length of time
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.120]   that we suggest for people to sleep
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.800]   because we see impacts of all-cause mortality rates
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.280]   really going up when you're getting much below
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.760]   six hours of sleep, but it also goes on the other side
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.440]   when you're getting too much sleep consistently.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.160]   So that's concerning as well.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.640]   So they're kind of getting hit at both sides of this.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720]   So we're getting the insufficient sleep
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.800]   for stretches of time, and then we're just logging
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.600]   these really long periods.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.960]   So this is problematic for both sleep duration.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.400]   We know that that's not getting you the quality of sleep
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.760]   that we want to get.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.720]   Also from that bio-individual perspective
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.240]   that you asked about, so we know that most people,
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.280]   it's incredibly small percentage
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.080]   that might have this very strange, small kind of chance
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.680]   that they're short sleepers,
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.080]   but it's almost negligible, the percentage rate.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.520]   So most people need to still fall into this realm
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.280]   of this seven to nine hours.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.760]   However, it goes a little bit less as we age.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.360]   This is why sleep is dynamic.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.920]   So as we get a little bit older,
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.320]   we do find that people might go closer to, say,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.440]   that six to seven hours might still be a range
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.160]   that kind of appears and still be within a healthy domain.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.400]   But aside from that, when people start saying,
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.840]   "I'm fine, this is workable for me,"
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.480]   when we bring about more stability and consistency
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.280]   with their sleep, I can almost guarantee
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.240]   that what we see both on the ground and then in studies
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.440]   is that there's a change in the quality of that sleep
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.200]   for the better, and that will ripple into other metrics.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   So things like the improvements in often blood pressure,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.240]   their cardiovascular health, if we're looking at heart rate,
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   HRV, heart rate variability, and otherwise.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.640]   If we're talking about women, this could impact things
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.520]   like their cycle workability and others.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.000]   Okay, so I have so many questions,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.440]   and I wanna go into optimizing and all this,
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:49.200]   but how important is it that this quantity of sleep
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.160]   happens at one point in time?
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.000]   And it's interesting, 'cause we have two young kids,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.640]   and I'm like, "Oh, well, they get sleep at night and naps."
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.080]   And I remember some point in my life
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.880]   reading about this crazy concept
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.920]   of extreme polyphasic sleep,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.320]   where you could sleep for 20 minutes,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.920]   like six or eight times a day, and that would be fine.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.160]   We don't have to go that far down that rabbit hole,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.520]   but do you need to sleep all at once,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.320]   or can you break it up throughout the day?
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.360]   So people often will reference some of these findings
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.480]   that in centuries past, it appeared
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.120]   that we might've had two parts to our sleep
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.960]   was one popular way of looking at sleep,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.000]   and this kind of brings a sigh of relief
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.640]   for some people that are waking up
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.600]   throughout the course of the night.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   Like, "Oh, okay, maybe this is just one part of my sleep,
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.480]   "and now I have a little period of being awake
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.560]   "in a second part."
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.080]   And then there's also the group that you're speaking to
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.760]   of the multiple naps throughout the course of the day.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.280]   Now, how do we think about this?
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.560]   Well, we can also look at modern-day hunter-gatherer tribes.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.800]   So we can look at tribes like the Hudson tribe
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.480]   has been looked at from a sleep perspective,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.880]   and we don't find that to be indicative
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.680]   of how they're conducting themselves as one example,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.560]   but also how we like to think about maximizing
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.480]   and optimizing for sleep today.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.480]   It now has been drilled into that longer stretch of sleep.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.720]   It's still okay to have some wake-ups,
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.560]   'cause I know some people can get really concerned
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.080]   and nervous about stretches of time
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.640]   where they will have some wake-ups.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.240]   The difference is we're trying to understand
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.360]   how long are those wake-ups?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.400]   What is your response
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.960]   from a psychological perspective during that?
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.360]   And then of course, parents during stretch of times
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.000]   when we are, whether we choose to or not,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.280]   being awakened throughout the course of the night
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.280]   and understanding, can we make up for that?
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.600]   Well, one thing that we see is that largely,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.360]   we like to have still this very clear diurnal system.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   So meaning that as human beings, we're diurnal creatures,
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.760]   meaning to be active by day and largely at rest at night.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   And what we find is that as we deviate outside of that,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.760]   shift workers being an example of that,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.000]   they're being more active at night.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.240]   And we find that they have rates going up
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.640]   of things like cancer, heart disease, mental health issues,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.000]   and sleep-wake disorders
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.800]   simply by just doing things at night.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.400]   So it points to how important it is to maintain this.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.120]   So when we start juggling all of these things
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.920]   and we're sleeping for long stretches
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.320]   throughout the course of our night,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.880]   we know that often from a circadian perspective,
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.200]   which is one of the areas I'm particularly interested in,
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.240]   is that that seems to spill
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.480]   into some of your results with your sleep.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.960]   So the big takeaway here is how can we sleep
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.280]   as much of the portion of our evenings?
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.040]   And if you are needing to supplement that,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.360]   which sometimes can happen, of course,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.960]   as parents or we're traveling or we're sick
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.360]   or something is coming up,
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.920]   then you can supplement to a certain extent with naps
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.440]   unless you're dealing with insomnia.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.720]   But for the rest of us,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.360]   if you're just looking to make up for some of that sleep,
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.640]   those naps can make sense,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.120]   but we're looking to usually keep them
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.760]   somewhere in the domain of around,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.400]   often the power nap area.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.560]   So like the 20 to 25 minutes,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.080]   but usually no longer than a sleep cycle,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   like you pointed to, so around that 90 minutes.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   - But you can rejuvenate in a nap.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.720]   So if you're someone who just, for whatever reason,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.760]   isn't able to get a full night's sleep,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.720]   is there an optimal time of day for that nap?
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.480]   - Yes, totally, great question.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.400]   So earlier on in the day is what we're liking
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.000]   to position the timing for those naps.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.440]   So for most people, that would look like
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.120]   somewhere around before 3 p.m. or so.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.440]   Of course, if you have a different sleep-wake schedule,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.600]   adjust that accordingly,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.160]   but kind of in your early afternoon
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.200]   so that you're not tapping into
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.040]   some of those adenosine reserves,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.680]   that kind of sleepiness chemical, if you will,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.120]   that's building up throughout the whole course of the day.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.480]   You can think of this as when you're first waking up,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.840]   you have some of the least reserves of this adenosine,
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.800]   this kind of sleepiness component,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.480]   and then it's accumulating
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.360]   throughout the whole rest of the day.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   And we want it to be just toppling over
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.680]   at the brim when you get to sleep.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.120]   But there's a couple of things
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.680]   that can impact the adenosine load.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.960]   One of them can be naps.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.800]   So that could kind of dump out some of your reserves
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.360]   of adenosine for the day.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.080]   Another one, very common one, can be things like caffeine.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   It won't dump it out in the same way,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.720]   but it will make your brain think
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.120]   that it's kind of not present,
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.320]   like trick you into thinking that that adenosine,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.800]   that sleepiness component, isn't building up.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.760]   So these are ways that you can both have it all.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.960]   So how to be refreshed, get kind of that second wind.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.760]   And that can also spill into things
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.920]   like someone like Andrew Huberman is kind of popularizing
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.240]   this non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.080]   So kind of this trance-like state, if you will,
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.480]   where you're, whether it's yoga nidra,
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.240]   a hypnosis-like state.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.880]   So you might not even be fully asleep,
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.320]   but still your body is getting some of the benefits
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.640]   of being in that restorative state.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.240]   So that can be another way to recoup a little bit of energy
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.680]   throughout the course of the day.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.720]   - And I watched that video, the Huberman thing,
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.000]   and I was like, oh,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.160]   because I wanted to ask this question
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.320]   about whether there's a way to get some of the benefits
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.920]   of sleep while not sleeping.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.840]   But if what you're doing is, you know,
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.040]   kind of lying down and doing breathing exercises,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.840]   like I felt like, oh, might as well be sleeping.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.480]   Like maybe if you can't sleep,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.360]   but if you were lying down, relaxing,
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.120]   listening to music or reading a book
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.320]   or doing anything a little bit more active
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.080]   than just meditating, for example, or breathing exercises,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.560]   can you get any of that benefit
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.400]   or does it really need to be sleep?
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.600]   - So this is a huge one I find that can be really helpful
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.560]   for people that are dealing with sleep anxiety.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.240]   So sleep anxiety can kind of go in the domain.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.400]   This is something that I dealt with
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.160]   when I was going through my sleep kind of breakdown
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.800]   years back was this fixation on sleep
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.720]   and then this feeling that, oh, okay,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.640]   so if I'm not getting my sleep
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.440]   throughout the course of the night, I'm just screwed.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.560]   You know, like I'm just not getting these results,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.760]   but it turns out that one thing we can kind of keep
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.240]   in the back of our mind is that there is still some benefit
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.280]   from being in kind of a restorative state,
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.920]   even just in a, you know, laying supine position,
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.880]   your heart rate's coming down,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.200]   closing your eyes can also help change
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.240]   some of your brain activity
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.680]   and allows for some of this restorative processes
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.760]   to happen of the body.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.360]   Now, is it the same as sleep?
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.880]   Not quite, but it still can give you
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.040]   a little bit of a respite in knowing
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.920]   that you're doing something generous for the body.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.800]   Now, this can apply both in the middle of the night
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.000]   if you're struggling to sleep,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.920]   just knowing that you're still getting some restoration
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.120]   by being in kind of that peaceful, relaxed state,
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.560]   bringing the heart rate down.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.960]   So the body can still go to work on some of that repair
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.080]   and yet that applies during the course of the day as well.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.240]   Now, I see this really in a cool way gamified
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.960]   with wearables lately.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.920]   Two that are doing this well, I think,
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.440]   is both Whoop and Oura Ring.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.200]   So they're actually showing you your daytime stress load
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.400]   and then almost helping to reward, if you will,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.880]   stretches of time when you're getting
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.440]   a little bit of restoration.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.960]   It will show you clearly and kind of give you
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.320]   rundown or a quota for how much of that restorative time
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.080]   you're getting throughout the course of the day.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.680]   And so it can kind of help to gamify this protocol,
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.800]   if you will, instead of just like a nice to have.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.360]   Now, suddenly you're offsetting high amounts of stress
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.560]   throughout the course of the day
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.360]   with a little breather kind of recovery time.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.800]   - Okay, well, that's helpful because sometimes
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.400]   I just like to lie down for a few minutes
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.320]   and just close my eyes,
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.160]   but I don't really want to commit to a nap.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.400]   - 100%.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.840]   - It seems like every week there's a new data breach
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.800]   to expose your personal info,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.560]   like how in November, pretty much the entire population
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.920]   of Maine had their personal info exposed.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.880]   And once your info ends up in one place,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.200]   it's like plain whack-a-mole to get it taken down
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.960]   from all the other data brokers.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.520]   Fortunately, you can get them to remove your info,
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.440]   but unfortunately, that process can take hours
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.480]   to do yourself.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.200]   I know because I tried to do it.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.160]   And after spending over 10 hours,
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.640]   I gave up and started using Delete.me, our sponsor today.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.720]   Delete.me is an amazing service I've been using for years
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.560]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.680]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.440]   and get that removed as well,
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.360]   which really matters because in my last report,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.200]   I saw my personal info show up
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.800]   and subsequently get removed
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.640]   from another 61 data broker sites.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.520]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.560]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.640]   And to date, they've removed over a hundred million pieces
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.160]   of data for their customers.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.040]   So if you wanna get your personal info removed from the web,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.200]   go to allthehacks.com/delete-me
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.240]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.600]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/delete-me.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.760]   (air whooshing)
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.720]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.760]   when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.920]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.320]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.760]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.080]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.760]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.160]   from Anyday, I'm a total convert
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.360]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.160]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.200]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.560]   and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.240]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.560]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free

[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.080]   When we think about optimizing sleep,
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.360]   who benefits from optimizing sleep?
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.400]   Is this something for everyone?
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.440]   Are there some people who maybe you have it good already
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.720]   or what things should people be asking themselves
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.280]   before they wanna decide
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.520]   if this is a journey they wanna go down?
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.360]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.560]   Well, first off, I would like to offer for people
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.240]   that I truly do believe that sleep is a skill
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.400]   and like all great skills,
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   no matter if you think and you have it
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.160]   that you have this handled,
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.800]   that you can venture into mastery
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.720]   and that there is always this opportunity
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.120]   for us to improve upon this area.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.240]   And even then when you might think you have it handled,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.280]   something happens.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   You get divorced, you have a death in the family
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.240]   and we'll find it bleed into your sleep results.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.600]   So I would offer for everyone
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.480]   to explore taking this area of life on
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.040]   as the foundation by which you are really setting up
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.760]   your wellness journey before nutrition, exercise,
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.600]   mental health strategies, of course,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.000]   those are all so important and they're bi-directional.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.160]   I would offer that there could be some benefits
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.560]   by taking on a lens of prioritizing your sleep first
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   and that will aid in your ability to fulfill
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.960]   on all those other things.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.240]   Get yourself to the gym, make the smart decisions
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.880]   and when you're standing in front of the cupboard
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.720]   or what have you.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.960]   So from that place, what are some indications
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.040]   that you might be struggling with your sleep
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.120]   and that you might wanna really take this area on?
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.400]   One can be, we've talked a lot about sleep duration
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.800]   and some of the numbers you might be logging
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.120]   and you might say I'm getting all those
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.160]   but I still feel tired, sluggish,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.480]   not at my best throughout the course of the day.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.640]   That could be a sign for us to look at some of the sleep
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.480]   that you're logging.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.320]   Is it as rich as it could be?
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.680]   Are you having a lot of labels around your sleep?
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.400]   I would say things like I'm a short sleeper,
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   I'm a bad sleeper, I'm a night owl, it's in my genes,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   I'll sleep when I'm dead.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.720]   So it goes into narratives.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.640]   So you might have certain ways
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.040]   by which you're relating to your sleep,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.840]   like it's just fixed and that's how it's gonna be
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.560]   versus that we would just have a set of results right now
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.680]   and that there's an opportunity
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.960]   for more of a growth perspective to improve upon this.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.600]   If you're tracking, your sleep efficiency numbers
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.760]   might not be as high as we would like them to be.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.040]   Now, we don't want them to be too high
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.760]   because then that can mean you're falling asleep
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.560]   right as the minute your head hits the pillow
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.000]   but often in kind of this high 80s, low 90s range
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.840]   might be an area
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.560]   that we might wanna look to optimizing for.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.480]   If you're relying on a lot of things to improve your sleep.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.000]   So if you have a lot of supplements,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.480]   this whole particular stack that you need
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.640]   in just in order to kind of fall asleep or stay asleep,
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.720]   that could be indicative of the fact
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.320]   that now we're kind of bringing about,
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.960]   we have these external things
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.280]   that we now require to get great sleep.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.120]   And that's not to say
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.920]   that we won't do all kinds of cool things
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.680]   with optimizing your environment
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.880]   and bringing all kinds of things to improve your sleep
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.600]   from a environmental and setting you up powerfully.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.800]   But if you feel like you yourself cannot get great sleep,
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.840]   that can be a sign for us.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   And then also, if you have the sense
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.120]   that you used to sleep great and then something happened,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.480]   I had kids, which understandably there may a stretch of time
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.400]   where your sleep absolutely will be disrupted.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.880]   So I don't wanna stress anyone else with that.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.080]   But we see there can be these narratives that get developed
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.040]   and then we start to lower the bar
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.680]   on what's possible for us,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.760]   where we might be able to actually make a big difference
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.320]   with some of these results.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.520]   So that can be important,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.720]   but also just getting curious
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.400]   about different stages of life.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.280]   Your sleep is gonna look very different
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.920]   from teenage years to 20s to 30s, 40s, 50s beyond.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.680]   And we want to keep checking in and testing,
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.920]   seeing are there hormonal changes at play?
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.440]   Is there environmental, do you move into a new house
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.480]   and now you're not getting the same level of sleep?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.680]   Is there something going on in that space?
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.640]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.160]   So there's a lot of signs and those are some.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.280]   - I know you have a whole list of 10 on the website.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.880]   We'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.040]   What are kind of the factors?
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.320]   Let's start with the environment and routine stuff.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.160]   - Okay.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.680]   First, I would like for people to think about the fact
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.160]   that our circadian rhythm becomes paramount in this.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.360]   What is your circadian rhythm?
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.720]   It's around this 24 hour rhythm
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.280]   that as human beings, we're all operating within.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.920]   I mentioned that we're diurnal creatures.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.360]   So of those 24 hours, half of the day,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.840]   we want to be ideally prioritizing
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.640]   getting out in the light, movement, activity.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.200]   You're doing things when the light is out,
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   but then when the sun sets and when darkness comes,
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.400]   we want to be prioritizing sort of a day mode
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.680]   versus night mode.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.400]   And when that night mode comes about,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.200]   we wanna really shift our environment accordingly.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.040]   Why?
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.160]   Because there's something known as zeitgeibers
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.600]   or time givers.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.800]   And these are just kind of sayings
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.560]   of what are some of the things
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.600]   that massively impact our circadian health.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.640]   And the most important,
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.240]   if you get nothing else out of what I'm saying,
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.480]   I know we're talking about a lot of things,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.640]   but if you get nothing else out of what I'm saying,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.160]   it's minding your light dark cycles
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.680]   is our most paramount to strengthening our circadian rhythm.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.760]   I go to these like sleep conferences
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.680]   and believe it or not, they're sleep conferences.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.840]   And some of the biggest takeaways
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.760]   can be boiling down to having ultra bright days
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.280]   and dark nights.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.560]   And that can sound so simplistic,
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.840]   but most of us are not doing this
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.560]   to the point that there was just this year
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.120]   a call from a scientific consensus
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.000]   saying I'm pulling from almost 250 circadian scientists
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.280]   referencing almost 2,700 peer reviewed scientific papers
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.120]   pointing to the need to add warning labels on light bulbs
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.920]   when used at night.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.560]   So why?
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   Because they found that the use of simply
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.880]   just boring old light bulbs that we're using
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.720]   on a routine basis are increasing rates of cancer,
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.240]   diabetes, heart disease, mental health issues,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   as well as of course our sleep awake challenges
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.600]   that we might be seeing.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.520]   So something so simple as swapping out our light bulbs
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.800]   to go from our traditional LEDs,
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.880]   which now 'cause incandescence became illegal this year,
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.800]   which were more closely aligned with the rhythms of nature,
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   those are now illegal, you can't purchase those.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.240]   So now you're left with fluorescents and LEDs.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.000]   So of those, they tend to be very blue rich
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.440]   and blue is gonna disrupt your melatonin production
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.320]   to levels that most people don't realize the impact.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.000]   So at the bare minimum,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.640]   you're changing your light bulbs in your environment
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.280]   to mimic the rhythms of nature.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.840]   So one thing that we used to be around was fire
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.800]   and fire was kind of that first biohack
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.840]   and that was very red rich.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.360]   So we want our light bulbs to be more of that red amber color
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.280]   or candle lights, Himalayan salt lamps,
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.960]   any of this very dim lighting.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.200]   So you wanna first start there, but it doesn't end there.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.040]   You have to in the mornings to help inoculate yourself
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   from any of those negative impacts
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.080]   of even any of this faux light.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   You really need to get that bright light exposure by day
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.760]   and much more than you're gonna be getting indoors.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.880]   Then the second piece would be going into things
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.720]   like temperature timing, meal timing, exercise timing,
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.560]   thought timing, and drug timing.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.720]   So all of this timing phenomenon
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.320]   of where you're putting things in your day
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.520]   will impact your circadian strength
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.680]   and by effect your sleep-wake kind of signaling.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.880]   Okay, so let's run through these.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.200]   So for light, the takeaway is get rid of the blue lights
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.960]   in your room and maybe replace them with warmer lights.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.000]   Make sure that it's not just says,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.440]   'cause some of them will say like, "Oh, warm tone LEDs."
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.880]   But traditionally what we often see
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.280]   is that those are still insufficient.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.240]   They're still have blue in many of them.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.080]   So just making sure they should really look pretty amber,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.440]   hued or red, and now more of them will actually point
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.480]   to that they've been tested
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.320]   so that they'll still be sleep-friendly.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.400]   And I assume if you're not getting outside right away,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.160]   at least open up the windows, but even better go outside.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.440]   Even better go outside because there are studies
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.160]   that show that it can take anywhere from 50
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.320]   to 100 times longer to reset your master clock
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.240]   when getting light from behind windows.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.400]   Like if we're watching the video,
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.480]   I've got all these windows behind me.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.120]   Even though I've got so much light coming in here,
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.600]   it's still insufficient to reset my master clock
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.120]   in the morning if I was just to rest on my laurels
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.200]   and only get light from behind here.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.080]   So you really need to go outside.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.920]   Why?
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.480]   Because the light is gonna hit your eyes.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.760]   You don't want sunglasses on during this period
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.880]   in the morning, hats, any of those things
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.400]   that could obstruct that sunlight.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.140]   You want it to go directly into your eyes,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.640]   which is connected to that suprachiasmatic nucleus.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.320]   And that suprachiasmatic nucleus is kind of
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.840]   that master clock that then's communicating
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.920]   to all of these peripheral clocks in virtually every cell
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.020]   and organ in our body.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:11.040]   So trillions of clocks that are looking to help stay
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.240]   on time and facilitate the workability
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.080]   of your sleep-wake cycle, among many other things.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.720]   So when you first get up, our philosophy is get up and out.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.400]   So you wanna get up out of bed, but outside.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.200]   So the dog walkers and all the things
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.480]   are really winning the day here.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.880]   The people that have reasons to bring their animals
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.740]   or pets outside or what have you.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.440]   So whatever's going on in your life,
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.860]   if you can set yourself up to get out there,
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.380]   that will make such a huge difference
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.200]   for then resetting this master clock.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.100]   And then it creates almost this invisible countdown
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.760]   to when you're gonna get sleepy in the evening,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.680]   16 hours or so later into the night
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.500]   of when you'll be developing more melatonin in the evening.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.880]   So they're connected.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.800]   - So this morning, I just looked, San Francisco, sunrise,
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.080]   6.49, I was up before 6.49.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.840]   If I get up at six, is there a benefit to going outside
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.320]   when it's not bright yet?
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.740]   Or should I really be waiting until the sun is out
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.800]   and it's a bright day to go outside?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.680]   - Yeah, so it's a very good question.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.920]   Because for a lot of people,
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.360]   then there's a reality of life.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.040]   They've got circumstances, they've got kids,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.560]   they've got jobs, they've got whatever.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   So what do you do when you're waking up
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.020]   before the sun is rising?
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.780]   Well, there's kind of a couple camps
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.680]   that have been emerging on this.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.240]   One from sort of a scientific circadian perspective,
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.000]   a lot of the recommendation will be,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.480]   all right, well, if that's the case,
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.000]   then you can use faux interventions.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.880]   So you can use like sad lamps and things that,
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.400]   so seasonal affective disorder lamps,
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.620]   really bright lights, bright blue lights.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.800]   So the time when we would be potentially
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.480]   cultivating more blue light would be in the morning.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.080]   And so that would be the suggestion from that camp
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.140]   is getting as much of that blue light in your eyes
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.640]   as possible in the morning.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   Now, ancestral health proponents will instead point to
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.980]   in the morning versus getting all that bright light
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.960]   and kind of the activity that that would be.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.080]   If you can still align with the rhythms of nature
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.440]   and use a red light during that time,
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   that would be the suggestion of this emerging kind of camp
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   is to then wait till you are getting outside
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.960]   to get that natural light and truly syncing up
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.360]   with those rhythms of nature.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.080]   My suggestion on that is if you are able
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.960]   to align with these rhythms, that's always preferable.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.440]   We did that for thousands of years.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.600]   Edison only came up with the light bulb
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.520]   about 144 years ago.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.360]   So we have this kind of recency bias
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.640]   where we think that this is just always how it's been.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.040]   But in the span of human history,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.480]   this is a very new phenomenon
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.340]   that we can even do these sort of things.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.880]   So if you are leaning towards and have the ability
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.080]   to create your schedule in such a way,
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.920]   that could be great.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.640]   So you could perfectly kind of align with those rhythms.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.560]   But if you cannot, which I have plenty of clients who can't,
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.840]   then you could lean into technology
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.800]   to kind of help wake you up
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.080]   at the times that you are needing to get up.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.600]   With the right lights in the room and that kind of stuff.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.440]   Exactly.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.640]   And there's even like glasses that are being created
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.880]   that will have blue lights that will shoot right into yours.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.500]   So you could be, you know, making breakfast,
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.340]   doing whatever you need,
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.220]   and then you can be kind of Star Trek-esque.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.640]   Okay, so that's lighting.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.680]   What about what's in the room?
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.800]   You know, your mattress, your pillows,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.720]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.200]   Okay, so one of my biggest suggestions,
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.040]   'cause after light-dark is temperature
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.240]   being really important for your circadian health.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.200]   So for temperature,
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.800]   what a lot of people are missing the mark on
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.320]   is that they might know,
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.480]   yeah, we want to sleep in kind of cool environment,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.520]   but they might not know to what degree
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.400]   and some of the things that are available.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.240]   So one, some of the suggestion out of the Sleep Foundation
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.760]   is in the realm of around 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.620]   for ambient sleep temperature,
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.520]   which many people I speak with are not in that range.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.160]   So even just beginning there,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.800]   and of course we don't want this to be
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.720]   massively uncomfortable for you.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.360]   So play with this accordingly.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.720]   But I think people are often surprised,
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.920]   especially when they start tracking
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.040]   to see when they lower the ambient temperature
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.720]   that they often get better sleep results,
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.040]   less sleep fragmentation, less wake-ups.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.640]   'Cause even if it's kind of a little chilly when you go in,
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.600]   then throughout the course of the night,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.760]   you can benefit from that,
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.480]   especially when we're moving into REM
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.860]   and we start heating up the body
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.120]   and that's when often people might wake up
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.040]   'cause now they're hot
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.240]   and when they didn't go to bed hot.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.680]   But the other thing that I would definitely suggest
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.920]   if available to people,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.320]   now this is a bit of an investment,
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.120]   if it's on the table is a cooling mattress topper.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.800]   So like Chili, Sleep Me, Eight Sleep, Sleep Number,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.880]   different companies that offer the ability
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.000]   to cool the mattress itself.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.160]   Why? Because historically,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.800]   we would have slept outside on the ground
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.360]   as part of our thinking or closer to the ground,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.400]   which would have been part of the coolest part
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.960]   of our environment.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.760]   So even though it can sound newfangled and fancy,
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.120]   we're kind of mimicking how we assume
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.920]   we likely had slept for thousands of years previously.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.400]   So getting that cooling effect versus the cooking
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.000]   that can happen when we're in full mattresses,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.680]   covered with these heavy duvets
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.760]   and then have our own body temperature,
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.280]   just in there for seven to nine hours
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.680]   throughout the whole course of the night.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.560]   And many of us are then waking up from that heat effect
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.080]   and that can be problematic.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.160]   - I often go into hotels
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.320]   and it's like they only have these huge thick mattresses.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.520]   I'd rather leave the room cool
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.080]   and just sleep with one sheet.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.400]   But is it better to leave the room really cold
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.920]   if you still need comforters or ditch all the sheets?
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.200]   Like what is the optimal number of sheets
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.120]   and the thickness of them to have
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.400]   if you can control the room temperature around it?
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.520]   - Okay, so one,
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.800]   there's gonna be a bio-individual component to this
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.880]   'cause each person's gonna run cooler or hotter,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.640]   so it will depend on you.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.160]   But I would begin with the most gentle process out of it.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.640]   So if you're usually sleeping at 72 degrees,
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.480]   then I would have you begin at say 67
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.120]   and see how are we faring with that.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.360]   'Cause we're not trying to freeze you
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.640]   out of your sleep results
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.200]   'cause that can be negatively impactful as well.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.520]   So you would start at around that 67,
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.480]   see how that affects you.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.760]   Now this is going to change depending on each individual.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.200]   So especially women of menstruating age,
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.320]   you might find different parts of your cycle,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.160]   you're gonna be massively different on a temperature scale
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.440]   than you would be just two weeks prior
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.480]   if you're in luteal versus the beginning of your cycle.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.920]   I know we'd like to be able to say,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.000]   "Oh yeah, well you just put it at 63
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.720]   and that's how it goes."
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.160]   But it doesn't quite work like that.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.600]   So instead we wanna keep beginning
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.000]   at what can be comfortable for you
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.480]   and keep working your way back.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.720]   This is where trackers can really be helpful
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.840]   in the process too to see how do you respond
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.200]   when you start like that.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.120]   - And when it comes to the environment in the bed,
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.120]   is more or less sheets better?
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.720]   - So I would say that what we're trying to do
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.440]   is a banana shape throughout the course of the night.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.880]   So basically you're starting in
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.400]   when you're comfortably warm, right?
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.200]   And then we're helping to facilitate
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.320]   that we're cooling throughout the course of the night
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.880]   and facilitate that our body can be cool.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.080]   Some of those lower levels.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.680]   And then when you get into REM,
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.120]   you would be warming up into the early morning hours.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.040]   So you might find that if you do have a wake up
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.320]   that you might kind of take off one of those sheets
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.680]   throughout the course when you're going into REM.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.920]   That's perfectly natural and normal.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.840]   It's not a static piece
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.680]   where you're just staying at the same temperature
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.800]   throughout the whole course of the night.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   So it might adjust for you.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.360]   And what you ate, what time did you eat?
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.280]   Do you have alcohol?
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.200]   Do you have all these other things
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.960]   that might've impacted your body temperature?
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.200]   But traditionally we usually want breathable materials
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.040]   in your bed.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.240]   So you want breathable sheets, breathable duvets.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.760]   You want mattresses that are not gonna trap heat
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.000]   'cause a lot of them are trapping that heat.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.240]   So you want the ability for this to not get stuck
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.040]   and kind of insulating you.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.800]   - Obviously, you mentioned the technology.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.640]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.480]   I haven't ate sleep.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.680]   It's been fantastic.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.800]   They've been a partner of the show.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.440]   So I haven't tried every product.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.720]   I imagine there are many products you can use.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.440]   I just happened to have an experience there
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.000]   that was good enough to reach out to them
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.840]   and work with them.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.680]   - Amazing.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.640]   - And it's very helpful when you're trying
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.920]   to do exactly what you described.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.000]   I would prefer to fall asleep a little warmer,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.760]   but I'm okay sleeping a little cooler.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.160]   And for me to fall asleep cool,
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.040]   like it just doesn't work.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.840]   I end up throwing too many covers on
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.960]   and then they're on in the middle of the night
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.840]   and then I'm hot.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.600]   So this has been a good balance for me
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.560]   to have a thin sheet on top, stay warm, falling asleep.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.520]   So I've been a big fan.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.360]   - Everybody listening knows that allthehacks.com/atesleep
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.840]   and you can get a discount on the ate sleep cover.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.000]   So totally vouched on the technology.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.040]   What about pillows or sleep position?
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.200]   You know, sleeping on your side, your stomach,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.040]   all those kinds of things.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.360]   How does that affect sleep?
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.160]   - Yeah, big deal.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.320]   Particularly for the prevalence of mouth breathing,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.360]   we're seeing a lot of that
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.240]   throughout the course of the night.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.920]   And what position can kind of facilitate more of that
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.200]   is often sleeping on your back.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.000]   And so we're just trying to make sure
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.440]   that we're not mouth breathing.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.560]   That's one of our biggest concerns with sleep.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.240]   And so that can often spill over
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.640]   into rates of sleep apnea, upper airway resistance syndrome,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.440]   which is much more prevalent than most people realize.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.520]   So our understanding, we just had an expert on the podcast,
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.000]   a ENT that pointed to our estimations are globally
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.800]   about one in four people having sleep apnea.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.320]   And of that only about 10% of these insurances
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.480]   of sleep apnea being actually diagnosed.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.080]   So we're dealing with just a lot of people
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.880]   running around undiagnosed
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.400]   for some of these respiratory based disorders.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.560]   So sleeping on your back can often
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.200]   be a big flare up for that.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   So our often recommendation for sleep
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.280]   is a side sleeping element,
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.240]   'cause we do see that when we're sleeping on our stomach,
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.960]   then that can sometimes mess with
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.640]   some of both our breathing,
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.320]   and then of course, comfort and some of the other issues
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.240]   that might come up from spine positional piece.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.840]   But if you're just like amazing of a breather
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.840]   and we're not dealing with that,
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.800]   then you could benefit from some of the elements
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.880]   of sleeping on your back.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.680]   If so, there's of course different types of pillows
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.880]   that you might bring in for each one of those
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.560]   side sleeping versus back sleeping.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.000]   - Okay, and so what about mouth tape?
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.560]   'Cause I feel like I'm not comfortable sleeping on my back.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.720]   If the goal is sleep on my back to prevent mouth breathing,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.560]   could I just sleep on my stomach or my side
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.480]   and tape my mouth?
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.840]   - This topic of mouth breathing in the sleep community
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.320]   has really flared up.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.560]   And there's a lot of concern that so many people now
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.840]   are starting to mouth tape.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.520]   And I can be such a fan of mouth taping,
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.040]   but I think here are the caveats,
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.520]   and this is why a lot of the sleep community
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.600]   is upset about it,
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.320]   is that many people are just mouth taping
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.080]   and not taking the steps to get tested
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.800]   to make sure there's no respiratory based disturbances
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.920]   at play, because if you are,
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.840]   you truly are just band-aiding the problem
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.880]   to the point that it can actually make it worse
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.520]   in some cases, if you do have sleep apnea,
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.840]   upper air resistance syndrome, some of the snoring.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.680]   But that's not to say that one,
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.640]   if we clear that out, make sure that's not present
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.920]   and you're good to go,
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.200]   then that you couldn't benefit from mouth taping.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.000]   And it's also not to say that then if we discover
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.160]   you did an at-home sleep test, easy breezy,
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.520]   you find out you have one of these disorders,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.880]   which are really prevalent,
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.840]   then can we use mouth tape to help
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.880]   with the treatment process, that you're also being treated
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   for this and using mouth tape,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.800]   you can absolutely do that as well.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.280]   But I think there's just a concern
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.240]   'cause some people are now just blindly taking these steps
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.200]   without knowing that they might be doing some harm.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.040]   - That makes sense.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.800]   And you mentioned an at-home sleep test.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.920]   We can all buy these trackers
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.440]   and we're gonna get to technology in a little bit,
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.520]   but at what point does it make sense
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.840]   or maybe high level, how much would it even cost
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.880]   to do some kind of more rigorous study on sleep,
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.760]   either at your home or in a lab?
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.280]   - So exciting that we're at a time
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.040]   where now you can be tested at home
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.920]   and for some pretty reasonable price points,
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.320]   even out of pocket.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.800]   So in the United States, there's a number of companies
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.080]   that you can be sent very quickly an at-home sleep test,
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.880]   often around $200 or so out of pocket to be tested
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.440]   for some of these breathing-based sleep disorders.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.480]   So these respiratory sleep disorders.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   Now, if you think that you might have
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.960]   something more egregious, we wanna be checked
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.880]   as far as sleep stages are concerned.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.240]   'Cause again, to truly understand sleep stages,
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.480]   you really do wanna look at the brain
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   and the brain activity.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.920]   And then if you're concerned about things
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.360]   like restless leg or other things, narcolepsy, et cetera,
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.720]   there might be a time and a place to go in lab.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.240]   But now, if you're looking at that respiratory piece,
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.400]   you can just get tested by companies
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.160]   like Lofta, Empower Sleep, other companies are available,
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.840]   no affiliation, but these can send you a medical device
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.360]   that you can test at night in the comfort of your own home,
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.720]   which is a big deal 'cause many people feel like
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.040]   they can't sleep well in some of these facilities.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.840]   And so this can be a nice option in between.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:02.240]   - Are these more for testing sleep-related disorders
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.160]   or could they be a more accurate version
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.240]   of using sleep trackers?
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.720]   Or if you're someone who's like, I sleep pretty well,
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.680]   but I'm certainly open to getting from a 90 to a 100,
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.840]   is the sleep study at home,
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.360]   is that gonna help in that department
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.200]   or is it more diagnosing?
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.360]   - So there are some pieces of tech like the Wesper is one
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.640]   that you can use literally as like a little patch
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.440]   and that will give you some information
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.360]   kind of an in-between.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.320]   It's not quite a consumer grade tracker,
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.760]   it's not quite a at-home sleep test,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.120]   but it's giving you more in-depth information
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.400]   so that can glean some more information
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.840]   from something like that.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.080]   - But the at-home sleep tests that are gonna give you
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.160]   a kind of medical stamp of approval of saying,
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.280]   okay, yes, it does appear that you do have sleep apnea,
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.960]   for example, if that's the case,
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.080]   you're only gonna test for most of them one or two nights.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.920]   And out of that, if we do come back
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.720]   with some disorders present,
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.040]   that is gonna totally ripple into your results
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.920]   with your sleep trackers.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.280]   It won't be the whole story,
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.240]   but it will certainly help support
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.640]   the improvement of those stats.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.720]   - I know one of the most common piece of advice
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.000]   everyone says is, oh, keep your phone out of your room,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.680]   no screen time before bed.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.080]   How important is that?
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.720]   And is there ways to make it better
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.100]   that aren't a total eradication of all screens?
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.640]   Because I think in many cases,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.960]   that's just not practical, right?
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.160]   Like our phone is our baby monitor,
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.560]   like we wanna check on our kid, kid's coughing.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.800]   So we're not gonna get rid of screens before bed
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.200]   or next to the bed.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.000]   - Absolutely, I completely hear that.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.800]   So one, can we leverage the light piece?
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.440]   So can we put red glow to those screens?
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.720]   So what can you do on iPhones?
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.840]   There's this hidden color filter that's within there.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.680]   Even if you Google color filter iPhone sleep,
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.600]   it will come right up of how to set this up.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.760]   So you make it all red.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.600]   And so that in and of itself will make a big difference.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:01.640]   If you have an Android, you can put on twilight.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.220]   And so that will go all red.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.960]   Even that will make it less excitatory,
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.080]   but then there's element of just auditing
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.920]   what type of information are you taking in on those screens?
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.780]   And if it's a TV, then using blue blockers
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.440]   that are amber or red tinted can also help.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.280]   - Okay, it doesn't have to be gone,
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.240]   but there are ways to improve it.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   And obviously I'm sure if it got completely rid of it,
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.600]   it would be even better.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.540]   - Totally, and can we have a bit of a hybrid?
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:30.200]   Can we have the change in color
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.860]   so that it's a little less addictive in nature,
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.620]   but then can we also set up some workable
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.500]   kind of boundaries for ourselves?
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.380]   Some suggestions are in our modern day,
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.140]   if you have your smartphone out,
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.420]   then you're bringing it into your bed.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.940]   And can you just have kind of a no phone in bed rule
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.100]   as far as just when you're laying there,
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.300]   can you even have to stand to use it
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.340]   just to make it much harder to utilize this
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.860]   in a more relaxed state
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:57.900]   so that there's just some sort of boundaries.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.180]   But what could be a boundary for you
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.660]   that would be helpful to make it
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:03.780]   just a little bit more challenging
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.380]   to use a super addictive device?
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.780]   - And what about if you just have that
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.420]   like stroke of creativity,
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.860]   which sometimes happens to me and I'm like,
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.260]   I'm trying to go to bed and I have this idea.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.340]   And now all of a sudden I'm like,
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.020]   I could probably crank out this entire blog post tonight,
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:18.860]   but it's 10 o'clock.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.500]   Do I sit on my computer and crank it out?
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.620]   How much am I screwing my sleep by doing this
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.420]   versus it might take me three times as long
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.520]   without my productivity tomorrow?
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.940]   - What I would suggest now,
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:31.500]   of course there might be some time in life
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.340]   where just such a stroke of genius,
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.660]   you wanna move on that.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.740]   There might be some instances where that can make sense.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.700]   But most of the time,
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.820]   if this starts to happen kind of chronically,
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.780]   what we're looking to do is bracket.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.820]   So you have this stroke of genius
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.020]   and then you put it into your calendar
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.100]   for a time that you know you can keep your word
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.700]   on fulfilling on working on that thing at that time,
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.100]   where it would align with these rhythms,
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.820]   align with your productivity.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.060]   So that now instead of working on it at 11 p.m. or whatever,
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:07.060]   now you're gonna be working on it tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.460]   You can let your brain relax
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.900]   that you're not just giving up on your dreams
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.320]   or whatever this exciting thing might be,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.100]   but you're instead reorganizing it into a time
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.740]   that makes sense for your sleep-wake cycle.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.580]   - Let's go on to food
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:22.700]   because I feel like both timing and what we're eating
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.940]   and let's also include drinking probably has a huge impact.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:26.780]   - Absolutely.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.140]   It's one of the more fascinating areas I find
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.060]   and one of the more challenging areas
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.260]   for a lot of people to make this lasting change.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.500]   What would this change look like?
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.460]   Well, one, you can understand something known
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.540]   as circadian rhythm intermittent fasting.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.880]   And this is just a fancy series of words
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.420]   that basically means that we're looking to eat largely
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.860]   when the sun is out and largely provide a bit
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.540]   of that digestive break in the evening when it's dark out.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.780]   And now this is not to lose your mind over
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.640]   because of course there are certain periods of time
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.380]   when you will be eating, when it's dark out.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.200]   So just looking to kind of cluster a lot
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.540]   of your eating time closer to these rhythms of nature.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.100]   And this is what we would have done for so many years.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.500]   So how can we bring this into our modern society?
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.660]   A lot of the research on this is coming
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.720]   out of the Salk Institute, Dr. Sachin Panda.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.460]   We did a fascinating podcast episode with him
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.100]   and highly suggest checking that out
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.520]   if you wanna learn more.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.720]   But what I would say about the takeaways
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.900]   with that is that his finding after decades of research,
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.520]   lots of great books, et cetera,
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.620]   is that bare minimum, the last bite of food you have,
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:40.260]   you're having that about three hours before bed.
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:44.420]   Now, I'll also say that we also find even just
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.620]   on the ground from a lot of wearable data,
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.260]   some benefits for people even going a bit further than that.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.160]   So this is more in the anecdotal clinical setting.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.260]   But if we look at things like four to five hours
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.980]   before bed experimentation with that,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.520]   your last bite of food, often we see things
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.460]   like heart rate go down, HRV go up,
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.580]   changes in body temperature, blood oxygen,
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.500]   of course, your instances of sleep apnea.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.420]   'Cause we know that if you are having
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.580]   any respiratory based issues or mouth breathing, et cetera,
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.380]   some of these things can flare up
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.460]   if you're eating too close to bed.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.500]   Unfortunately, many people that we look at
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.780]   are now eating most of their day
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.300]   from when they first wake up to when they're going to bed,
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.860]   not too much before that.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.420]   So this is problematic.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.540]   - Any particular foods to avoid
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.320]   either at different times of the day or altogether?
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.000]   - Yeah, so there's a reason that we so often have people
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.260]   wearing continuous glucose monitors
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.740]   because one of the more common reasons
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.380]   that people are having wake ups in the middle of the night
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.780]   is blood sugar instability.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.100]   So we're looking to bring in foods
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.140]   that are gonna help support a healthy glycemic index.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   Can we have something that's not gonna massively spike us
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.300]   throughout the course of the day
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.580]   and then have a subsequent crash?
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.940]   Because how we're managing our days
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.040]   often gets mirrored in our nights in many regards,
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.740]   but that is not excluded with blood sugar.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.480]   Berry is a company that integrates with Aura now
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.980]   so that you can overlay your sleep data
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.300]   and then see, oh, look, I crashed at 3 a.m.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.700]   and I also had a wake up.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.780]   So you can start to correlate some of those things
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.340]   that are very much connected.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.100]   Inflammatory foods that you're having,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.020]   so that can impact the airway
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.100]   and kind of the size of the airway.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.020]   We're looking to avoid things like coarse sugars.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.380]   So we'll see people go on some of these kind of
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.340]   sugar cleanses or Whole30
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.200]   or all these different things that people do.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.020]   And it will visually even look different
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.780]   in their sleep results in those sections of time
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.100]   when they do change their diet type,
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.340]   even aside from diet timing.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.380]   If you look at management of both
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.520]   the timing and the type of food,
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.540]   then you can often get a real change in your sleep.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.420]   And to the point that I have seen reliably
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.060]   people even having things like
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.500]   changes in up to around 10 beats per minute
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.220]   in the heart rate just in a relatively quick period of time
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.200]   just by moving the timing.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.820]   So their heart rate going down markedly
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.300]   just by moving that timing of that type of food.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.900]   And then of course, if they change the type of food as well,
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.820]   that can also be augmented.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.980]   - Are there any foods that you would encourage people
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.540]   to add to their day or their evenings
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.620]   or anything to encourage sleep?
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.180]   - Yeah, one, checking in on your choline,
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.520]   the amount of choline you're having
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.460]   and how that can play a role in things like your REM.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.280]   So quality of REM, the duration of REM.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.120]   - What's choline?
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.540]   - So choline can be both supplemental,
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:42.180]   but also in things like eggs and certain meats
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.360]   and certain things that you can be aware of.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.660]   We wanna be getting choline.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.200]   And if you're not getting that in your diet,
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.780]   if that's not, doesn't apply to you,
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.060]   then we might wanna supplement for some of those things.
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.420]   Now, of course, this is just one piece of the puzzle.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.540]   So I don't want people to feel like
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.700]   they need to immediately go out and supplement,
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.460]   but being aware that some of these nutritional items
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.020]   are so important for our sleep quality.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:07.840]   So the most basic is that we wanna avoid things
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.420]   that are gonna spike us highly.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.660]   So going, if you even Google the glycemic index
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.380]   and go on the things that are gonna be
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.860]   the most spike heavy, we wanna be kind of mindful of those
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.980]   because those are gonna show up in those sleep results.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.260]   Also, if we're eating too close to bedtime,
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.400]   then that temperature spike can often go up
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.060]   and that can be counterproductive
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.900]   to helping us guide off to sleep.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.060]   'Cause you wanna remember
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.100]   that we're looking to set up our evening
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.420]   so that we're dropping our body temperature
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:41.280]   quite markedly in order to facilitate melatonin production
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.980]   and sleep onset.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.460]   But if you're eating late and the types of foods
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.700]   that are gonna be upping your body temperature,
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.580]   like those high glycemic load and what have you,
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.700]   then it can make your body temperature too high
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.420]   and that can be troublesome to fall asleep.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.580]   - What about drinks?
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.620]   I know caffeine and alcohol
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.620]   kind of have a huge impact on sleep.
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.660]   What's the concise advice there?
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:09.220]   - Okay, so this goes under the umbrella of chronopharmacology,
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.660]   the timing of your drugs.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.340]   So where are you gonna put your drugs?
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.900]   Caffeine, we would like to keep
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.020]   on the first half of your day,
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.780]   knowing that there's bioindividuality.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.380]   Some people are slow or fast metabolizers.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.940]   So if it takes you a long time to metabolize that,
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.060]   then you might wanna be aware
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.060]   and move it a bit earlier in your day.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.400]   So what could that look like?
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.100]   So for some people, we try to put it before around 12 p.m.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.960]   This is generalized depending on your sleep-wake schedule.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.700]   But if you struggle to metabolize that,
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.940]   for some people, they might be faster metabolizers
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.000]   and they can get away with a little bit later,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.380]   something like 2 p.m. or so
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.500]   that you have a bit more wiggle room.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.460]   But you wanna kind of check in also subjectively.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.140]   This is where the subjects,
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.460]   you can both test with DNA testing
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.100]   to see how fast or slow a metabolizer you are,
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.700]   but then the subjective assessment of,
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.020]   are you more sensitive to and struggle to fall asleep
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.500]   when you have that higher amount of caffeine?
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.980]   So that would be on the caffeine piece.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.100]   For the alcohol piece, oh my goodness,
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.460]   this is the one where, for most people with wearable data,
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.180]   that's one of the biggest takeaways they get
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.700]   is just how much they're impacted
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:19.420]   by even one drink or two drinks or what have you.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.740]   And even if you're not tracking,
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.500]   then you can likely have a sense
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.540]   that you're waking up differently
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.380]   after a night of a drink or two.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.220]   I very rarely see people be able to have alcohol
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.460]   and it not show up in your sleep results.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:37.340]   What that looks like is a typically improved sleep onset.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.060]   So it truly does often help people fall asleep
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.500]   in many studies, but then it falls all apart.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.180]   Then often we have a whole slew of sleep fragmentation.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.220]   You're hotter throughout that course of the night.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.940]   So it can impact the type of sleep that you're getting.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.180]   So it can just be a whole mess.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:55.140]   And similar to THC being another one
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:57.740]   that also seems to do something akin.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.980]   So similar with often helping with falling asleep,
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:03.380]   but then the quality gets a little funky,
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.380]   but a little different on your readouts.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.660]   But certainly with alcohol,
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:07.740]   the earlier the better.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.180]   So if you can do things like happy hour,
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.460]   if you can do boozy brunches, any of these,
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.020]   that's truly one of the best ways to make it
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.460]   so that it's not hitting at your sleep so much.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:21.860]   But the truth is it is one of the lowest hanging fruits
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.340]   that you can have to take out of your rotation
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.500]   to improve your sleep.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.780]   Even if it's just one drink, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.820]   Yes, there have been recent studies,
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.780]   even within 2023 and into 2024,
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.420]   looking at just one drink having impact on our brain matter
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.940]   in a particular way that we don't necessarily
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.780]   wanna cultivate and seems to show up
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.180]   in some of our sleep results.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.860]   Now I will say there's bio-individuality.
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.260]   So I have some people that it's not showing
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.700]   as much of a hit with say one drink
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.980]   if they're doing it kind of early enough.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.820]   So certainly one is better than two, for sure.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.220]   Okay, so we talked about food.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.500]   Where does exercise fit into sleep?
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.380]   Yeah, so exercise, if we think of our nature of exercise,
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.940]   one, any exercise for most people,
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.740]   'cause we know most people are not exercising
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.860]   and moving their body enough.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:14.140]   So if we're somewhere in that realm of 3,000 steps or so,
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.380]   or just really sedentary lifestyle,
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:19.820]   we for sure wanna be prioritizing exercise in general,
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.540]   'cause we know that this makes such a difference
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:22.660]   for our sleep results.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.780]   If you wanna improve that sleep quality,
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.460]   exercise is a place to look.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.540]   If you're someone that is into stats
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.540]   and you wanna improve things like your HRV,
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.620]   heart rate variability,
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.980]   exercise is definitely a place to look.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.060]   So first beginning there,
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.100]   so I don't wanna dissuade people from exercising,
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.460]   but the time can be helpful as well.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.820]   Can you get a little bit of movement in the morning,
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:46.260]   ideally outside in the sunlight,
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.420]   so a morning walk or what have you.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.340]   But then if you do have this available to yourself,
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.940]   you're stronger, so you're more physically intensive
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.100]   types of workouts later into the day
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.980]   when your body has had the opportunity to warm up a bit
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.420]   and have less of a risk of injury,
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.020]   you're kind of more able to be more cognitively intact.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.580]   To take on this task of exercising at that time
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.660]   is a theory around circadian entrainment.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.660]   Are there any tips you have for people,
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.140]   both in the first stage of trying to fall asleep
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.420]   and the wake-up stage?
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.300]   Sometimes I'll wake up, stuff's on my mind,
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.420]   and I'm just like, "I just need to go back to sleep."
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.460]   Hopefully you're kind of learning some of these things
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.380]   that we've been speaking about.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.380]   So over time, hopefully you have less and less of these,
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.660]   but in the meantime, you're having some wake-ups.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.500]   What do you do?
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   A couple of things that we would practice is one,
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.940]   acceptance, I know this can sound so light,
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.740]   but acceptance of the fact that you're up,
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.620]   because so many of us will fight and resist
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.020]   that we are awake at 3.20 a.m. and we don't wanna be.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.780]   And the more we start resisting this,
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.940]   why is this happening?
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.700]   Is there something wrong with me?
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.380]   Some sort of line of thought,
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.220]   this can wake you up more than we're looking to facilitate.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.340]   Two, if you are playing into,
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.500]   you should know about something called CBTI,
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.780]   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia,
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.140]   'cause if you are struggling with staying asleep,
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.340]   you might benefit from some of those practices.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.780]   Check that out, we got lots of podcasts on that.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.740]   But some of the rules of thumb there
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.100]   can be that if you are awake for a stretch of time,
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.220]   going outside the bedroom
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:18.180]   and doing something light and relaxing in dim lighting.
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.580]   I will say that is one area
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:24.580]   that I sometimes have some of my clients not abide by,
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.300]   that if that fits for you, if that's helping you
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.060]   and you do that until you're a little sleepy, great.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.820]   But it's also important to know
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.940]   that there is the option of kind of laying
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:36.260]   in a relaxed position.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.340]   You can do things like breath work.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.220]   If you wanna bring in like meditations and other things,
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.260]   you can do that.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.460]   And if you have kind of dim lighting,
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.380]   so red lights or what have you,
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.500]   you can bring in things like reading, writing.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   So writing out any of those stressors is a big suggestion.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.300]   So what that would look like is taking a piece of paper,
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.780]   have it always by your bed.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.900]   I actually have pens that glow red.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.860]   So you can use that pen or a way to have dim lighting
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.940]   and have two columns.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.380]   And on the right hand side,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.580]   you're putting in all of your problematic issues.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.260]   So anything that's coming up,
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.780]   you just kind of outline all of those things.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.460]   And then on the other side,
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.660]   what you're doing is you're putting all of those solutions
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.740]   to those concerns.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:23.980]   Even if there is no solution
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.820]   and you have to practice acceptance,
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.260]   you are doing that in that time.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.860]   We just saw this recent study called the Mind After Midnight
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.660]   that showed that our thought patterns
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.860]   actually have a different way of behaving
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.020]   in the wee hours of the morning.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.820]   So we see rates of suicidality, anxiety, depression,
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.580]   all these other things go up in these wee hours.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.060]   So you can be aware that you might not wanna believe
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.860]   some of the thoughts that are coming up
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.540]   in the same way that you might do
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.060]   throughout the rest of your day.
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.420]   - My tactic has previously been to throw on a meditation,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.020]   an audio kind of like guided sleep meditation.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.420]   Peloton has a ton of them.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.260]   - Sure.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.100]   - I don't know if you're familiar.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.700]   Someone recently told me about the cognitive shuffle.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.380]   - Oh no, what's that one?
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.460]   - Okay, so I'll encourage everyone to try this.
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.740]   You too, if you fall asleep
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.820]   and you wake up in the middle of the night
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:13.900]   and you're trying to go to sleep.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.860]   So the way if I remember right that it worked
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.220]   is you pick a letter at random
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.540]   and you visualize a word that starts with that letter.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.140]   And then you take each letter in that word.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.380]   So let's say you say B and you say blood.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.060]   And then you go B and then you just visualize B words
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:32.900]   until you're out.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.340]   And then you visualize L words
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.460]   and two O's doesn't really help.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.620]   But anyways, the idea is that you're just visualizing words
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.460]   and thinking about them.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.700]   So if the word was bat, you'd visualize a baseball bat
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.300]   and like kind of turn it around in your head
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.180]   and think about it.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.980]   And then you'd move on to the next one and it's a bag
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.260]   and you visualize a bag
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.460]   and you imagine looking at it from all perspectives
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.460]   and thinking about it and imagining the word.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.500]   The idea is it kind of puts your mind
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.620]   in this similar to a dream state
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.900]   and you just fall back asleep.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.420]   I've tried it once or twice and it's worked.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:03.860]   They swear by it.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:04.860]   I haven't sworn to it,
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.700]   but that's one obviously not as good
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.660]   as just getting good sleep and not waking up.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.380]   But I will try to find a link and put it in the show notes.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.300]   So for a lot of people, maybe with a partner
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.580]   that one of their routines was watch a show before bed.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.020]   Obviously you could put on some blue light glasses
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.860]   or something, or maybe watch on a laptop
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.100]   with a red profile.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.620]   But are there some activities that you could maybe do
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.140]   with a partner before bed
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.020]   that might be more promotive of good sleep?
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.900]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.540]   Our whole goal in the evening is what are we doing
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:38.660]   in the hours leading up to help facilitate the brain
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.020]   coming out of this hyperactivity state
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.180]   to just calming itself down.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.540]   So how can we do that?
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.420]   So one, we can change the environment.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.300]   So whether that's music,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.380]   whether that's the type of conversations we're engaging in,
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.500]   like massage, reflecting on our day,
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.060]   gratitude exchanges, different things with our partner,
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.340]   the stretching piece,
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.980]   different things that can help facilitate,
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.020]   okay, we're gearing up for sleep.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.660]   Some people will bring in things like Theragun.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.540]   - And what about like playing cards?
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.140]   Where does that fall in the spectrum
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.820]   of like ramping down versus up?
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.300]   - That is a great question.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.100]   What we think of even just from an ancestral perspective
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.660]   is the evenings were often meant for bonding,
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.100]   for connection,
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.180]   'cause we know that loneliness and sleep are interconnected.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.140]   So anything that you can do to kind of bond
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.540]   with your partner, your tribe, your people,
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.580]   that seems to make sense
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.140]   that it can help support our results with our sleep.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.300]   So you just wanna check in periodically like,
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.460]   are you super competitive
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:38.740]   and you're getting really stressed out
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.980]   at the end of this card game?
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.020]   Do we need a bit more buffer time?
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.540]   So would we do this a bit earlier in our evening?
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.180]   And then maybe we add in some time
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.340]   to kind of wind down more with reading
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.420]   or something more low key.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.260]   But if it's something
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.060]   that's just a really joyous activity for you
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.620]   and doesn't bring about stress,
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.820]   then that could be a great activity to bring in.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.780]   - So does that mean if it's non-stressful
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:04.020]   but highly functioning in your brain,
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.820]   it could be okay, like a crossword puzzle?
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.740]   - So the big thing is,
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:11.900]   is that particularly right up before sleep,
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.420]   we're just looking to not be too cognitively engaged.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.900]   So your evenings are this whole wealth of time
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.340]   where you can set yourself up for more off time.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.740]   So we're not working
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.540]   and we're moving over into connection or relaxation.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.420]   But then I would say there is a bit of this buffer time
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:31.900]   before bed where you might not wanna just
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.900]   have the crossword puzzle in your bed.
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.500]   Things that could just get you a little too worked up
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.580]   might take away from our goals.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:40.540]   And so what that could look like is also,
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540]   things that excite you.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.300]   So even you stress, like EU stress, excitement things,
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.980]   those can still be activating.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.620]   So we just wanna keep taking that inventory.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.580]   Maybe for some people, the crossword puzzle
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.500]   is sort of just this relaxing, low-key,
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.060]   down-regulatory activity.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.020]   For other people, they're stressed out about it.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.260]   - The last in the kind of camp that I wanna ask about
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.580]   is sleeping with a partner.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.780]   I feel like I haven't found great data on this,
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.260]   but how does that affect your sleep?
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.420]   What should you do if you do have a partner
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.900]   and one of you is sleeping well, maybe both of you aren't?
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.860]   What are best tips for people that share a bed?
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:17.860]   - So glad you asked that.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:21.540]   This is our number one most popular episode.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.780]   And I would definitely suggest that people listen to this
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.700]   with Dr. Wendy Truxell.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.540]   And this is her whole area of focus.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.980]   And she has a book called "Sharing the Covers."
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.980]   And it's looking at sharing the bed
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:37.340]   with your significant other, kids, pets, et cetera.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:40.020]   Because we do see that can be really disruptive,
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.980]   even if we think it's helpful.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.860]   So meaning that a lot of people
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.740]   will look at their sleep results
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.780]   and their sleep is clearly impacted
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.660]   when they have this other partner or whoever in bed.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.820]   And then we have them sleep by themselves and it's better.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.260]   But then you ask them and they say,
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.020]   "Oh, I always sleep better with my partner."
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.540]   So point being, I'm not saying that everyone needs
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.980]   to separate from their sleep environment.
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.940]   Although what she's pointing to is called a,
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.260]   she's coining instead of a sleep divorce,
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.220]   a sleep alliance, nicer way to put it.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:14.020]   So that you are during certain times
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.580]   when maybe you have different shifts that you're working
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.940]   or different schedules,
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.180]   or you're navigating treatment of things
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.300]   like sleep apnea, snoring, et cetera.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:28.020]   Or kids, dogs, maybe it's a temporary period of time
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.260]   that it can make sense.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.620]   It's not like a failure to be in different rooms
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.740]   if that's available to you.
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.980]   But the big takeaway is yes,
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.740]   your environment can really impact
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.140]   some of your sleep results, including the pets.
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:41.620]   And actually there are high on the rank of things
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.500]   that can disrupt us over the long term,
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.140]   even more so than kids often,
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.740]   because they're usually around for longer in the bed
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.980]   than kids for just a few years.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.460]   So you want to take inventory and kind of audit
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.540]   what is going on with anyone else that's in your bedroom
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:00.900]   and have some real conversations and look at this
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.980]   in a way that is pulling for a great sleep.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:07.060]   So there's no shame if we do have to separate
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.420]   during those periods.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.660]   If we are having the snoring and sleep apnea,
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.020]   upper air resistance syndrome,
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.180]   it's impacting both the person that that's happening to
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.780]   and the partner.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.300]   - For people who aren't having issues,
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.020]   I know even just like the mattress toppers,
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:22.860]   I know they ate sleep.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.420]   Like we could choose temperatures differently.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.860]   And we started to make little changes,
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.180]   but we've got an episode.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.580]   I'll link to the episode in the show notes
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.780]   for people who want to go deeper.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.620]   - Amazing.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.380]   - And when it comes to these trackers,
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.380]   we've talked a lot about Aura
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.660]   because that's the one I'm using
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:36.220]   and one you use with a lot of clients.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.220]   What do you think of the spectrum of trackers?
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.820]   And if someone's using a Whoop,
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:40.900]   are there preferred ones,
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.460]   ones that are like just not good, don't buy the marketing,
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.900]   or how do you think about that?
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.100]   - I think it's a really exciting time
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.940]   that a lot of these can be so helpful
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.540]   to at least just get you some data
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.340]   outside of logging pen and paper
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.900]   because so much can start to get illuminated.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:59.900]   And things like Garmin, Whoop, BioStrap, Aura, Apple,
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.300]   some can be brain-based like Muse,
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.260]   in addition to things like Fitbit and some of the OG ones.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.340]   So a lot of these are gonna be helpful, bare minimum.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.460]   And for sleep in particular,
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.780]   there is a reason that for us still to this day,
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.860]   for years and years,
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.420]   we've required that people have had the Aura ring
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.340]   to participate in our programs
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:22.700]   just simply because as far as a sleep-specified tracker,
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.180]   it does really shine in that area.
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.780]   Now, of course, any consumer-grade tracker
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.020]   has certain things that have those limitations.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.180]   We touched on the sleep stage classifications,
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.660]   which definitely have their shortcomings,
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:38.340]   but there are things that we have a bit more weight in
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.460]   as far as its accuracy.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:42.300]   Like it's, are you awake or are you asleep?
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.300]   That tends to fall more and say like the 90% rate
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.380]   of accuracy as far as, okay,
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.700]   we could probably guess that it's pretty accurate
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.540]   for the most part.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.740]   There might be some flaws here and there,
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.700]   but that's one of the reason we go with Aura.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.740]   But we also, especially in recent years,
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.900]   have been starting to uptick our amount of working
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.420]   with people with the Whoop band.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.860]   So they're doing a lot of really cool things for sleep,
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.660]   even some cool stuff with like AI sleep coaching in there,
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.780]   which is really, really cool.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:12.100]   So they're pulling your data and then they can say,
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.220]   oh, well, Chris, okay, well, let's look at your HRV
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.740]   and you had these trends for the last couple of months
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.460]   and here are some things you could do
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.220]   to improve these numbers.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.660]   So it's pulling with your actual data
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.780]   and then bringing from some of the latest in sleep science
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:28.580]   to provide practical application.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   So I think that's what we're gonna start seeing more of.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.860]   And then in recent years, this year in particular,
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.740]   we're seeing these daytime stress monitors
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.140]   link up more readily.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.540]   So like HRV tracking and how stressed are you by day,
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.740]   'cause that can play a role
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.060]   in some of our sleep results by night.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:46.900]   Wow, okay.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:48.860]   So it sounds like with everything that's going on,
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.380]   both with technology and AI and data,
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.340]   we're gonna get a lot of cool stuff in the future.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:54.180]   Yes.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.020]   I am really excited.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.220]   Maybe we'll have a chat in a year or two
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.180]   and see where the whole world has evolved.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.020]   Totally.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.420]   In the meantime, we've gone over so much stuff.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:02.660]   I wanna make sure people know
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.500]   where they can stay on top of everything you're publishing,
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.580]   reading, sharing with the world.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.420]   Absolutely.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.700]   So at sleepisaskill.com, you can do a lot of things.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.180]   So there you can take a sleep assessment
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.100]   to get some real-time feedback on some things
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.980]   that you can do right away to improve your sleep.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.580]   You can also go to free downloadable PDF
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.340]   on ways that you can optimize your bedroom.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.420]   We talked about some of these
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.420]   and there's 18 high-tech, low-tech things
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.700]   you can do on there.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:31.220]   And you can also sign up for our newsletter.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.500]   It's called Sleep Obsessions.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.620]   Goes out every Monday for over five years.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.140]   And so we give lots of tips on that as well as our podcast.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.340]   But if you're really looking to dive in,
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.660]   then we have cohort groups
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.460]   that we require the Oura Ring to participate.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.300]   But then through that,
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:49.340]   you're coming in with particular stats with your sleep
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.020]   and you're leaving with a whole different set of stats
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.420]   at the end of those interventions.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.220]   So our commitment is really being able to help
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.820]   get us back in the driver's seat of our sleep
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.060]   so that we're not so mystified by it
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.020]   and hoping that it improves
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:06.740]   and instead really getting at the core
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.900]   of what's going on there.
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.380]   And then on the lightest side of things,
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.180]   we also offer audits.
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:13.220]   So we'll give wearable audits.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:16.980]   We'll go much more in depth with that individual's data
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.020]   and then set you up with particular things
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.500]   that you would be taking on for the next 90 days.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.180]   And then we'd auto-trigger some things for you.
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.180]   So in 90 days, you send us screenshots
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.700]   of what you've done to improve.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.020]   So hopefully we've seen actual measurable change
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:32.420]   and we see a lot of really cool stuff for people
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.540]   when they start getting aware of what's going on
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.740]   with their stats and what they can do to make a difference.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.580]   - That's amazing.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:38.940]   - The thing that I would like to leave
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.020]   is that my mission on the planet
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:43.540]   is to help support people with their sleep.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.380]   I really felt like when my sleep wasn't working,
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:51.140]   I felt like I was just losing my grasp on reality.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.340]   Like I was just so disempowered.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.860]   Once I got up under that,
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.660]   it completely transformed my experience in my own life.
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.340]   - Thank you so much for being here.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.180]   I really appreciate it.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.020]   - Thank you.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.980]   - Thank you so much for joining me today.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.140]   I hope you took away as much as I did from this episode.
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.340]   Huge thank you to Molly for being here.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:12.300]   And I'm actually gonna have her take a deeper look
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.700]   at my sleep tracking data to see what we learn.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.700]   And I'll follow up if there was anything interesting
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.860]   worth sharing.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:19.500]   On the topic of sleep technology,
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.740]   if you're interested in checking out the Aura Ring
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:24.500]   or the Eight Sleep Pod cover and wanna support the show,
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.620]   I do have partner links for both.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:29.740]   You can find them at allthehacks.com/aura,
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:34.020]   O-U-R-A, and allthehacks.com/eightsleep.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.940]   So thank you in advance for using those links.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:37.060]   If you're interested,
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.820]   Amy and I use both those products every single night.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.940]   We absolutely love them.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.620]   All right, that's all for today.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.900]   I will see you next week.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.620]   And until then, sleep well.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.200]   (upbeat music)
