[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Easter weekend has passed.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.460]   It was a great weekend to celebrate Christ, but Monday returns again, along with all of
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.800]   its spiritual challenges and sin struggles and roadblocks to our faith and discipleship.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.320]   And that includes the internal turmoil faced by a podcast listener named Billy.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.400]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   I live in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.200]   I'm a relatively new convert to Christianity.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.540]   I'm going through a season where I think I'm hardening my heart to Christ.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.440]   I feel constantly guilty of sins such as refusing to evangelize others, procrastinating, irreverence,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   arrogance, and idolatry.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.280]   I think I desperately want to repent, but also dread surrender of saying, 'Yes, Lord,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.280]   I'll do whatever it takes.'
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.080]   This is because I fear God will make me do something I really don't want to do.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.000]   What's wrong with my spiritual condition?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.720]   Is there a way that I can finally submit to Christ?
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.800]   Is there some spiritual obstacle I'm overlooking, or am I just being foolish?
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600]   Should I simply man up and do the hard stuff?"
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.760]   Pastor John, what would you say to Billy?
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.120]   Billy, there are different biblical ways to describe your spiritual condition, and I'm
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.920]   only going to mention one of them.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.420]   It's serious, but because of the nature of it, there is a way out.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.000]   So I'll describe the condition, because you asked me to, and then the way out.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.480]   I'm basing my diagnosis, since I don't know you and all I have to go on is those words
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.240]   that Tony just read.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.840]   I'm basing my diagnosis of your condition on these two sentences that you gave us.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.200]   You said, "I dread surrender of saying, 'Yes, Lord, I'll do whatever it takes.'
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.960]   This is because I fear God will make me do something I really don't want to do.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.240]   What's wrong with my spiritual condition?"
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.720]   What's wrong, Billy, is that you are deceived about God and what it will be like to experience
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.120]   surrender and a life of total consecration to Christ, what it will be like to say and
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.960]   mean, "I am yours, and I want to be as free as I can be from sin and as fruitful as I
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   can be in glorifying you.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.840]   So do whatever it takes, even if it takes my life."
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.240]   You are afraid that saying that will have consequences you don't want.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   Your dread of this is based on a deception.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.000]   You're not unique in this.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.920]   I'm not pointing my finger at you, but about millions of others.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.000]   This is how the human heart and the devil team up to keep us from the greatest possible
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.720]   holiness, the greatest possible glorification of Christ, and the greatest possible joy.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.920]   Jeremiah 17 9, "The heart, your heart, is deceitful above all things, and desperately
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.720]   sick who can understand it."
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.320]   Now, the heart, when he says the heart is deceitful, he's reminding us that the heart
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.520]   is the seat of sin, and sin has power only by deception.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.400]   That's the only way sin can work.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   So Hebrews 3 13 says, "Exhort one another every day that none of you may be hardened,"
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.480]   you mentioned hardness, Billy, "that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   of sin."
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.600]   That's how it works.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   Or another way to say it would be that our sinful desires deceive us.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   So Paul says in Ephesians 4 22, "Put off your old self, which is corrupt through deceitful
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   desires."
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.600]   You've got desires, desires to avoid something and desires to embrace something, and they're
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.400]   deceiving you.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.640]   Then add to that deception that the world outside us also deceives.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:29.240]   Matthew 13 22 warns against the deceitfulness of riches, which choke the word and it proves
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.120]   unfruitful.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.600]   And then there are people, not just riches, but people outside of us.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   Romans 16 18, "Such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but by their own appetites and
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.440]   by smooth talk and flattery, they deceive the hearts of the naive."
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.200]   And then add to all that power of deception, the devil, which Revelation 12 9 describes
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.640]   like this, "He is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world."
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.940]   That's what you're up against, Billy.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:15.620]   And judging from your fear of surrender, I would say these powers of deception are doing
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:24.100]   battle with your new self in Christ, and they are lying to you, deceiving you, and you have
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.040]   given some ground to them that you ought to take back.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.420]   And I'm trying to help you take it back by the power of God's Word and the Spirit.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.000]   So what is the deception that you are in the grip of?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.780]   And what's the truth, which is the opposite of the deception?
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.840]   You will know the truth, Jesus says, and the truth will set you free, John 8 32.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.100]   And the context of that verse is sin sets you free from the bondage of sin and deception.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.500]   You'll know the truth, free from the enslaving deceptions of untruth.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   And the deception is this, Billy, you test yourself now to see if this is true.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.940]   I'm saying you are deceived like this.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.320]   You are believing in your heart that if you say sincerely, "Yes, Lord, I'll do whatever
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:25.140]   it takes," God will make you do something you really don't want to do.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.500]   Now here's the truth.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:36.460]   Truth is that if you say sincerely, "Yes, Lord, I'll do whatever it takes, and you can
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.620]   do whatever it takes to make me as holy and God-glorifying and fruitful as I can be,"
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.660]   God will give you a heart that wants to do what he calls you to do.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.900]   That's the truth.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.660]   Right now in your deception, you can't see and feel that.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:03.740]   All you can see and feel is that God's call will be against some of your present desires.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.300]   That's what it means to be deceived.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.580]   Most people are locked up in this bondage.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.860]   These desires are what Paul calls deceitful desires, Ephesians 4 22.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.160]   They are lying to you.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:26.640]   They are telling you that surrender will only mean misery, miserable denial of these desires.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.100]   And that's the lie that you are believing in your heart.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.700]   Now here's the truth.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.940]   The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.940]   up.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:45.780]   And then in his joy, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:53.620]   Now while you are deceived, Billy, selling all that you have can only look idiotic, can
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.860]   only look like doing what you don't want to do.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.860]   That's what you said.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.940]   It's going to ask me to do something I don't want to do.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.020]   That's the only way it can look while you're deceived.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:09.860]   But Jesus said that when the kingly rule, the kingdom of Christ comes into your life
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.740]   with power, you see something so stunning, so beautiful, so valuable that selling everything
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.860]   becomes joyful.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:25.420]   On the other side, the front side of deception, it looks burdensome, horrible.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.700]   No way am I going to sell everything for this junk piece of treasure called Jesus.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.700]   No way.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.260]   And then bang, the kingdom comes in, sets you free.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.660]   Let me get rid of it.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.140]   The happiest thing in the world would be to have this treasure.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.300]   It's no sacrifice to sell everything to have this treasure.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.980]   The truth of the beauty and the value of the kingdom has set you free from the deception
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.940]   that selling all is miserable.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.640]   So here's the issue, Billy.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.820]   There is truth and there is a lie.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.660]   There is deception and there's liberation.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:07.180]   The lie, the deception, is that if you give yourself up wholly to God for him to do whatever
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:14.140]   he pleases to make you holy, God-glorifying, fruitful, you will be joyless, miserable.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.140]   That's the lie.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.980]   The number one lie of the universe is that lie, and you're believing it right now.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.580]   And the truth is that if you give yourself up wholly to God for him to do whatever he
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   pleases to make you holy and God-glorifying and fruitful, he will give you an eternal
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:41.540]   treasure, himself and all that God is for you in him, treasure, more enjoyable than
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:49.220]   anything in this world, and he will give you a heart that experiences this treasure as
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.940]   gain, not loss, even if it costs you your life.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:03.860]   So Billy, the way out of the deception is one, look, look, look, look at the treasure
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.780]   Jesus Christ, beholding the glory of the Lord, as Paul says, 2 Corinthians 3.18.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:16.620]   Number two, all the while praying, praying, praying for your eyes to see and a heart to
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.660]   feel the wonder of the treasure.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:26.580]   Third, surrounding yourself in this battle with mature Christians who will exhort you
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:32.980]   every day not to be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, Hebrews 3.13.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:40.420]   Join Paul in saying, "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.740]   knowing Christ Jesus my Lord," Philippians 3.8.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.980]   He is that valuable, Billy.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.060]   He is, that's the truth.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.340]   He is that valuable.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:57.500]   Don't let anybody or anything or any supernatural deceptive power deceive you otherwise.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.580]   Thank you, Pastor John, for your directness, and thank you, Billy, for your willingness
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.500]   to ask such an honest question.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.740]   It's questions like this one that help address the lives of hundreds and maybe thousands
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.860]   of others in the same situation.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.940]   Humble listeners with honest questions lead to episodes like this one that will serve
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.060]   many listeners.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.380]   That's how this podcast works.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.740]   It only works with your humble, honest engagement, so thank you.

[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.500]   Well praise and possessions, those are the two dominant idols of our age.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.140]   The desire for self-glory and the desire for material wealth.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.140]   So what is the Christian's relationship to the praise of the world and the possessions
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.140]   of the world?
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.060]   We have to think this through, and we will next time.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.060]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.500]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.500]   God bless.
