[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.560]   - Thank you all for joining us
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.360]   for our last session of the day.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.360]   I think it's a really good capstone for this conference.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.520]   I am so thrilled to introduce Michelle Singletary
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.400]   to all of you.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.280]   I know many of you know Michelle from her long career.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.140]   She is the personal finance columnist
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.840]   for the Washington Post.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.160]   She writes a regular column.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   In fact, she texted me yesterday and said,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   I've got this last minute thing I'm working on.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.640]   I'm on deadline.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.120]   She's always on deadline,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.160]   always writing really wonderful pieces of guidance
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.960]   for regular folks in the Washington Post.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.440]   She has written four books,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.600]   the latest of which is called
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800]   "What to Do with Your Money When Crisis Hits,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.360]   "A Survival Guide."
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.980]   Very well timed to coincide with the pandemic
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.200]   and all of the turmoil related to that.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.520]   I remember Jeff and I talked to Michelle
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.680]   for the Longview podcast during that time.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.800]   I think it was like April, May, 2020,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.960]   and Michelle was such a calming presence.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.840]   And I know that her readers really benefit for that.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.480]   She has won numerous awards for her work
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.980]   over her long career.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.080]   The most recent was a biggie,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.600]   the 2022 Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.560]   The award is considered the highest honor
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.480]   in business journalism in the U.S.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.320]   I'm choking up just talking about it.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.700]   It's a well-deserved award.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.440]   I wanted Michelle here,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.920]   she has a wealth of wisdom to offer on all things financial,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.560]   but one thing that she writes about
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.880]   that I think is really differentiated
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.800]   is that she talks about kind of spreading financial wellness
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.020]   in her community and her world.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.800]   And of course she does that through her work at the Post,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.600]   but she does it in other ways within her community,
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.120]   within her family.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   And I'll just say that that's one thing
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.460]   that really excites me about Bogleheads,
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.460]   that you're all so well-versed in your own financial lives.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.400]   And of course, picking up more and more acumen
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   is always important,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.220]   but I love the idea of deploying whoever's willing
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520]   within this group out into the world
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.040]   to help make things better for people who need your help
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.300]   and who might benefit from your wisdom.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.120]   So that's why I was thrilled that Michelle was willing
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.920]   to join us for this conversation.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.980]   So Michelle, I'm hoping you can just start
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.640]   with your personal story and how you evolved
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   into journalism and business journalism specifically.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.880]   - Yeah, great.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.640]   Well, first of all, thank you for being here.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.400]   I know a lot of people had to leave to catch a plane,
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.480]   so I don't feel any kind of way about that.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.320]   - Still a full house though.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.660]   - I know, still a full house.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.280]   And I, can I tell y'all, I didn't know I was in y'all club.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.020]   I just, I mean, I'm ashamed to say
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.280]   that I didn't really embrace you all.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   And I came to this wonderful conference
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360]   because I, you know, my husband and I have been indexing
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.520]   and very simple and forget it,
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.520]   and has created great wealth because of Vanguard.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   And that's very significant
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.680]   because our family doesn't have a lot of wealth.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.840]   And because of Vanguard and the principles,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.380]   we've been able to help family members go to college,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.760]   buy their first home, you know, help them with cars.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.920]   And so I'm right here with you
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.980]   and I didn't even know I was in the club.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.700]   So.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.120]   And normally in my normal day job,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.600]   you know, I don't recommend different companies
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.400]   for the obvious reasons.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.840]   But how do I get started in this?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.040]   So really it goes back to my grandmother raised me
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.320]   and my siblings, there were five of us.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.480]   And my parents, lots of issues abandoned us.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.520]   We went to go, my grandmother saved us from foster care.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.420]   And she was, if she believed in investing,
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.800]   she would be one of you guys.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.340]   But my grandmother was so conservative.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.520]   She didn't even buy bonds.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.540]   The only bond she had was the bond adhesive for her dentures.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.680]   So, but she was a masterful money manager.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.920]   Can you imagine five grandchildren?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.000]   Her husband was an alcoholic,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.200]   so he didn't always bring his money home.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   And yet she paid all her bills on time.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.800]   She was an unbelievable saver.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.640]   And she was never apologetic for what she couldn't give up.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   She never had any guilt that we were low income.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.400]   And that's what she, that's the legacy left for me.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.200]   And so I never realized that that would be my career
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   because even as a child, I challenged my grandmother.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.480]   I was the banker in my family.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.720]   And I, my siblings would come to me
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.940]   'cause they knew I always had money.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.080]   I would do odd jobs or I'd find money on the,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.600]   I'd pick up every penny on the ground.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.720]   You know that rule that you're not supposed to pick it up
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.160]   if it's on the opposite side?
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.320]   I think that's just crazy.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   It's a penny, pick it up.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.640]   So, so, you know, and those pennies add up.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.040]   So I always had money.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.520]   And my siblings would ask to borrow money
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.640]   and I would sit them down like they were at a bank.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.720]   Well, what do you need the money for?
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   And when do you expect to pay me back?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.240]   And I would determine whether I'd give them the money
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.520]   based on what they wanted for.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.320]   So you couldn't use my money to buy ice cream,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   but if you needed an extra pencil,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.920]   I'm gonna give you the money.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.120]   And you better give it back
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.280]   when you said you were gonna give it back,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.480]   or I'm gonna run after you to hope,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.920]   where's my money, where's my money?
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.100]   And you can imagine I was not the popular sibling.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.320]   And so when I got into journalism,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.440]   I always love talking to people and finding out something.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   I'm very nosy, and that's really why I'm in journalism.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.420]   And then I won a minority journalism scholarship
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.120]   to go to college, went to work for the Evening Sun
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.800]   in Baltimore, my hometown paper.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.680]   And the business editor approached me
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.760]   because I've been covering religion.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.180]   And because I'm a money person,
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.360]   I decided as a part of my religion beat
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.280]   to talk about economic development.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.320]   And she noticed that.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.360]   So she came over and she said,
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.080]   I want you for the business section.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.840]   And I started to cry because at that time,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.400]   I hope you're all not offended,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.220]   the only people in the business section
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.220]   were old white guys who love this stuff.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.040]   And then the old white guys who were ready to retire,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.200]   and they didn't have to work
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.680]   after the markets closed or weekends.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.480]   And so when she asked me, I thought it was a demotion.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.280]   And so I was like, why y'all putting me back there?
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.640]   And she said, no, I want to diversify the staff.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.880]   I want to have younger business reporters.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.040]   We want to write about more than just the markets
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.640]   of what businesses are growing.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.520]   And so she put me on the bankruptcy beat.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.020]   Who does that?
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.800]   I mean, and the great thing about the bankruptcy beat
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.560]   is 'cause who covers bankruptcy?
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.760]   So the bankruptcy judges,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.240]   normally judges and their clerks
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.200]   don't ever talk to reporters, right?
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.640]   But the bankruptcy judges were so excited
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.600]   that someone was interested in their work,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.080]   they would invite me into their chambers.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.240]   I mean, to talk about chapter seven and 13,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.080]   they were so excited that I was excited about it.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.400]   And so I had like, you know,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   I scoped the Baltimore Sun and The Post on stories
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.160]   'cause they would talk to me,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.480]   and that's how I got into it.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.160]   And little did I know
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.920]   that it really was the little Michelle Banker
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.320]   that was coming out.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.520]   And then I got a master's degree at Hopkins,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.320]   and then The Post came to calling,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.760]   and you know, as they say, the rest is history.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.200]   I've been working for The Post for more than 30 years.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.840]   I know I look 29.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.760]   And it is where I live, what I dream,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.720]   and the column is about doing all that you do,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.640]   trying to get people to understand this money stuff
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.280]   that is very complicated and very scary
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.540]   and very confusing.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.800]   But we all have to handle it.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.440]   And that's been my mission and passion for the last,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.960]   since I, the column is 25 years, since 25 years.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.320]   And my first column was about my grandmother,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.800]   how she taught me about money.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.600]   And this little woman who didn't,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   she wouldn't know, she don't know beta, alpha,
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.520]   you know, ESG, she don't know none of that stuff.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.600]   But, and I had to learn that part.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.160]   I had to incorporate that in my life,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.080]   but she put me on the road.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.040]   And I love what the last panel talked about with,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.080]   it's a lot about income and saving.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.480]   And I'm telling you, I hate those columns where,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.160]   if you just don't buy Starbucks coffee, you could be rich.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.740]   Y'all all know that's not true.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.980]   I encourage people to get that expensive coffee
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.580]   'cause if it's gonna keep you from slapping your coworker
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.580]   when you get to work, buy Starbucks coffee.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.020]   Because it's gonna get you to keep your job
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.300]   so you have the money to invest.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700]   - I went too long.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.700]   - No, that was awesome.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.420]   - I wanted to talk to you about the fact
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.820]   that you're in touch with a lot of people
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.860]   about how they're feeling about their investments.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.460]   Can you talk about the current environment
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.200]   where for the first time in quite a long while,
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.840]   we're seeing stocks and bonds sink at the same time.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.700]   So people who thought they were doing all the right things
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.780]   and diversifying have seen their portfolios
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.940]   and incur some significant losses.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.500]   So what kind of feedback are you getting
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.260]   from your readers in this environment?
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.780]   - Yeah, lots of people are scared.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.980]   I mean, after the Great Recession and things were bad
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.100]   and then we had years and years of growth
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.140]   and you really didn't have to do much
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.300]   to make in the market, right?
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.140]   You could consider yourself brilliant
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.700]   and just be invested in whatever.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.260]   And so we have a population of people
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.360]   who sort of believe that that's what always happens.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.320]   And so you got to have 20% return at 30% return.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   And this whole conference,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   people talk about how boring index investing is,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.760]   but let me tell you, I think boring is sexy.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   My husband is boring and he is sexy.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.940]   He's cheap and he's sexy.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.760]   So that's what we are overcoming right now,
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.520]   where we had all this growth,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.880]   where people didn't really have to do anything,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.120]   that portfolio could be out of whack, whatever.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.880]   And so the conversations I'm having with people is,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.680]   listen, this is just a blip in history.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.360]   Even the Great Depression ended, the Great Recession,
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.240]   it will end and many of us are going to live decades.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.480]   And so they are so worried
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.680]   because we have hyped them up on stuff,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.560]   crypto and everything has to be exciting.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.040]   And game stock, and so now when we hit that bump,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.240]   they're not prepared for that bump.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.640]   We are, 'cause we've been through some bumps,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.960]   we've been through some stuff.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.720]   And so all I'm, they're worried about inflation,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.600]   they're worried about the market, I get that.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.160]   And so one thing I try to do is I don't say don't panic,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.760]   'cause that just doesn't help nobody.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.880]   Go ahead and panic.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.720]   (screams)
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.960]   I panic, and I'm one of you all, I panic.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.560]   You know, and I wasn't looking at my portfolio at all,
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.600]   'cause I'd just be like, "Oh, Lord."
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.280]   But I know my husband, who's very calm,
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   and I'm like panicking and, you know,
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.280]   "Oh, we're gonna go broke."
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.000]   We're not gonna go broke.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.920]   And he says, "Wait a minute, don't you do this for a living?"
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.480]   So I say, go ahead and scream,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.320]   go ahead and feel what you need to feel,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.840]   just don't make a decision based on that.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.400]   And the lesson is that you gotta have everything else
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.320]   in your life in order.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.240]   So you gotta not have debt.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.400]   You gotta pay off that house before you retire.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.920]   You gotta not take on all the student loan debt,
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.160]   'cause if you didn't have all of that stuff,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.080]   during the times that the markets are down,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.480]   you can weather that storm.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.880]   But if you got debt, and you got a mortgage,
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.240]   you're just stretching for, and you're not,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.800]   all that stuff going on, and the market is crazy,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.160]   that's why that mixing bowl of stuff
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.920]   makes people make bad decisions.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.760]   But I scream, but we don't have any debt
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.720]   except for our mortgage, which I hope to pay off this year.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.640]   We sent all three of our kids to college debt-free.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.240]   You know, we use credit, but we pay it off.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.920]   We do all things, so even if I lose 50%,
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.120]   we're gonna be okay, right?
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.720]   We're gonna be okay, we will adjust our life, right?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.880]   And that's the message I think we have to tell people,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.600]   that this is a long game,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.920]   and this is just a blip in history.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.440]   - So you mentioned your family, Michelle, your kids,
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.600]   three children, and it sounds like you and your husband
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.120]   have spent a lot of time inculcating them
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.800]   in the concepts of good financial management.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.240]   Can you talk about, it sounds probably thrift
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.600]   and some of these other things,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.200]   but what are the habits that you've tried to build in them
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.160]   and/or model out for them?
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.480]   - Yeah, so I'm very proud, all three of my kids
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.960]   are very frugal, very cheap, which we embrace that word,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.360]   but my husband and I were very intentional
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.720]   about raising money-smart children,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.480]   and so when they were growing up,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.920]   we liked to make them suffer.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.640]   Not suffer, suffer.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.520]   So we did not give them a bunch of stuff.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.240]   If you opened up their closet when they were little,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.760]   there was very little clothes.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.480]   They had three pairs of shoes.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.280]   I was raised by a Depression-era person,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   so I'm really from the Depression era.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.640]   So we tried to not give them anything
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.560]   because we wanted them to just be kids,
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.360]   and we didn't give them cell phones,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.080]   we didn't buy all the games and things like that.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.040]   We just wanted them to live life with all the stuff,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.120]   and so we had a lot of rules in our house.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.760]   So one rule was, 'cause you know, kids watch television,
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.840]   so none of them ever had TVs in their rooms growing up
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.640]   at all, and we monitored that, not a lot of commercials.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.840]   So we had a rule that when they did watch television,
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.120]   all these commercials.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.360]   So we said, "You can get anything
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.560]   "that you see on a commercial."
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.720]   And we actually pretty did stick to that.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.440]   So my youngest, she's the bane of my existence.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.760]   So she was watching something on TV,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.040]   I'm in the kitchen cooking, I see her watching it,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.400]   I see the thing come up, some doll or something,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.600]   she comes in the kitchen, "Mommy, can I have?"
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.240]   I said, "Where'd you see it?"
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.720]   Now the kid is pretty smart.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.920]   Now she's my daughter.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.760]   So she knows the rules.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.480]   So she stood there, she closed her eyes,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.120]   she tilted her head, and she said,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.720]   "It came to me in a dream."
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.920]   Parents are always telling me,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.960]   "Well, how do I raise money smart kids?"
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.640]   There's one surefire way to raise money smart kids.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.920]   Y'all ready to write this down?
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.160]   I know you are.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.520]   No taking root.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.360]   The one thing is to say no.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.120]   Say no.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.280]   And so one time my kid was asking for something,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.520]   I don't know what it was,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.320]   I don't never listen to what they want.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.080]   It's like Charlie Brown's teacher.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.040]   When they ask for something, all I hear is what?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.480]   Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.560]   It's easy to say no
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.280]   if you don't hear what they asking for, right?
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.000]   "Mommy, can I have?"
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.040]   I said no.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.960]   So it's no plus a reason for the no,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.160]   that was the second part of it, the reason for the no.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.760]   So for our kids, it was to send them to college with no debt.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.520]   So, "Mommy, can I have no?"
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.640]   And I have three words for you, college fund.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.920]   Or two words for you, college fund.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.840]   She said, "Mommy, can I have?
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.880]   "Mommy, can I have?"
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.200]   Two words for you, college fund.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.800]   Or all my friends have it, Mommy.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.600]   Two words for you, college fund.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.440]   I know you have, 'cause she know we got money.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.800]   I know you have the money.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.200]   Two words for you, college fund.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.400]   This went on for about 15 minutes, y'all.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.160]   She was hot mad.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.200]   So finally, you know, after college fund, college fund,
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.160]   she said, "Well, I have two words for you now."
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.560]   I'm an old-fashioned parent.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.480]   Now, I'm not gonna say what I was ready to do to her.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.960]   She says, "I have two words for you, nursing home."
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.680]   Right?
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.240]   Now, you boggle his understand, right?
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.560]   Like I said, that's why I'm saving for my retirement, right?
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.040]   So we denied, denied, denied.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.360]   And I'm not saying that they were happy about it.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.840]   They didn't have what their friends had.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.760]   They didn't have the clothes that their friends had.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.320]   They had, you know, one girl asked my daughter,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   "How come you wear the same pairs of jeans?"
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.520]   And I love her answer.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.160]   She said, "Well, why are you worried about what,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.400]   "that I have one pair of the same jeans?"
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.520]   And so, and we did put a dead book on our bedroom door,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.840]   'cause we knew they were gonna snuff us out in our sleep.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.880]   But when did I know that it worked?
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.600]   When my oldest, the first one, graduated from college.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.840]   And we asked her to speak to a class.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.440]   My husband and I do a marriage and money class at our church.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.320]   We asked her to come in, 'cause everybody knew
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.700]   that our kids were all messed up,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.200]   because of all the stories I told her.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.120]   So we had to bring her in as proof
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.360]   that they weren't all crazy.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.480]   So she came in.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.240]   She'd never told us this.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.160]   She said, "Mom."
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.800]   She was telling the class.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.520]   She said, when she graduated,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.600]   all her friends were saying, "I got six months.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.560]   "I got six months before those lulls kick in."
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.400]   And I don't have that.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.760]   I don't have that.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.880]   When I walked across the stage,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.800]   I walked across in freedom.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.720]   But she ain't never tell me this.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:28.920]   But that's how we rolled as parents.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.600]   You know, I know, I tell a lot of stories,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.720]   and y'all only have a short time,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.320]   and all of us trying to catch a plane.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.080]   But we just, we were very intentional.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.640]   So, you know, we didn't go to the malls.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.440]   In fact, it was like a ban in our house.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.040]   If they wanted to go to the movies,
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.000]   they had to go to a movie that wasn't connected to a mall.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   They couldn't hang out at the mall.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.120]   And so, the few times we went to the mall,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.400]   my kid wanted one of those expensive pretzels.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.840]   She had saved up for it,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.000]   'cause she knew I wasn't gonna buy it.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.600]   She had a little purse and her little $5,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.880]   and she went up to the counter,
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.560]   and she asked for the pretzel,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.400]   and she gave the woman the $5.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.680]   Now, she was smarting money,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.400]   and the woman gave her back, I don't know, like 10 cents.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.880]   She started to fall out, "Oh, where's all my money?"
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.480]   And there were like a long line,
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.680]   'cause, you know, our auntie's pretzels,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.120]   there's always a long line.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.040]   Long line of people, and she was kerking out,
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.840]   like, "Where's the rest of my money, mommy?
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.400]   "Where's the rest of my money?"
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.040]   I said, "Well, that's what the pretzel costs."
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.760]   And she's crying, and she said, "I want my $5 back."
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.800]   And I'm looking at the woman, and she's looking at me,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.840]   and I'm looking at her, and I'm saying,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.320]   "Give her her $5 back."
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.680]   And she did.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.360]   She took the pretzel back, and she gave her her $5 back.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.240]   And I could hear people behind me saying,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.360]   "Well, why she just didn't buy the girl the pretzel?
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.200]   "Why she?"
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.640]   And I said, "Because I'm teaching her a lesson.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.520]   "She wanted that $5 more than she wanted that pretzel."
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.360]   And you know, she remembered that story
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.680]   when she told the college story.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.480]   She said, "I asked my mother for stuff.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.640]   "We asked my dad for stuff, and they said no,
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.000]   "and it would tick me off.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.200]   "But when I graduated, I was glad
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.760]   "'cause I didn't need that pretzel.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.280]   "I didn't need that dress.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.440]   "I didn't need that phone."
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.040]   But now she can be in a profession, she's a therapist.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.320]   Now I'm making a lot of money,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.120]   but I can be in a profession that God gifted me for
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.920]   because my parents said no.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.920]   - Beautiful.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   So one thing I wanna talk to you about, Michelle,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.040]   is sort of moving beyond your immediate family.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.960]   I know that many of us, I would guess many people
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.880]   in this room have loved ones in our lives
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.520]   who are not financially well, who need our help,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.280]   maybe need funds, whatever.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.440]   So I think a key challenge, if you're in that situation,
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.200]   and I've been in that situation,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.960]   how do you help without over-helping
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.200]   and certainly without kind of imperiling
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.920]   your own financial life?
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.560]   Can you talk about kind of creating that balance
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.920]   and delivering financial assistance to others?
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.360]   - Yeah, it's really hard.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.320]   You know, I'm a Christian, so there's a thing in the Bible
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.200]   about you can't be a prophet in your own land.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   And that's so true with your family.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.640]   They don't wanna hear nothing you have to say
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.480]   most of the time.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.280]   And so I had a lot of survivor's guilt.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   You know, I went to college, I got a good job,
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.240]   I'm making good money, and I felt guilty that I survived.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.760]   And so initially, I would just hand out money, right?
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.200]   I wasn't discerning enough.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.880]   And then I realized that people would be wasting my money.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   I'm frugal, I'm frugal, I breast all three of my kids,
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.040]   breastfed 'em 'cause the milk was free.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.880]   I mean, I just, still wearing my maternity underwear
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.720]   and my oldest kid is 27.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.400]   Don't I manage it now?
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.960]   I packed the good stuff for you all.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.640]   So, but then I realized I'm frugal, I'm doing the right thing
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.880]   and they're wasting my money.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.840]   So my husband and I, we're big on rules.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.800]   So we started to put in rules in place.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.440]   We will help you for a down payment on a house.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.880]   We will help your child go to college.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.600]   So we offered everybody in our family,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.720]   if your kid gets into college, we will pay for their books
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.120]   and, you know, incidentals for college.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.760]   So we decided that that's what we do.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.240]   We're not gonna pay for your irresponsibility.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.160]   Now, if you fall, that doesn't mean
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.360]   that we're not gonna help you,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.120]   but we're not gonna enable you
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   to have bad financial decisions.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.120]   And that works so well that,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.000]   and the other thing is, if you come to us,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.360]   you gotta show us a budget.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.080]   You gotta show us how you're gonna get out
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.280]   of whatever his situation is.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.040]   This is a whole thing.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.760]   And so two things happen.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.000]   People stop asking us for money
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   'cause they didn't wanna,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.920]   like my niece would call up and I'd say,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.880]   she'd ask for some money.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.120]   I said, well, you know what, I'm showing you no budget.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.200]   She hang up the phone.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   Save me $20, I'm okay.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.080]   And so we try to invite them to things.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.600]   My husband and I have a ministry at our church,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.720]   a financial ministry at our church.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.240]   We try to give them books and things like that.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.400]   But I decided that I'm not gonna kill myself
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   trying to make grown people do well.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.480]   If you want my help, when you're ready, come and I'm there.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.120]   And until you do, how do I get that passion out
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.960]   to help other people?
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.480]   I help other people that's not my family.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.680]   And eventually, many of them have come along,
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.400]   but I can't beat myself up about it
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.200]   because they won't listen.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.040]   I'm their sister.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.640]   I'm the person that was the banker.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.000]   I was the one who told on them when they was little
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.400]   'cause I'm not gonna get a beating.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.240]   You broke the plate.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.560]   My grandmother would beat all of us
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.240]   if one of us broke the plate and went to hell.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.200]   I tell, I'm a snitch, right?
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   Don't break the law 'cause if they come to me,
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.640]   you know how they offer people the deal,
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.880]   I'm gonna take the deal.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.160]   So we help them when we can.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.920]   And then when they're ready, when they fall,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.800]   because that's when they really are gonna listen.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.680]   You have to let people fall.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.920]   And I'm gonna tell you, I don't know who's in this room,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.880]   but you all have done a great job.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.000]   But statistically, your adult children
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   are not good money managers
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.760]   because you don't want them to suffer.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.920]   You don't want them,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.120]   you want them to have it better than you had.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.560]   You say things like that.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.760]   But because you struggle, because you were frugal,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.720]   you are who you are.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.560]   And so we have to not enable these adult kids.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.840]   So I wait for them to fall
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.240]   because sometimes you're not gonna get up until you fall.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.160]   And then they'll listen.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.680]   And then to satisfy my need to help other people,
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   I have a ministry.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.400]   I go into prisons to help people
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.080]   who are about to be released handle their money.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.800]   That's how I satisfy that part of my goal.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.280]   And I hope eventually that family members will learn.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.720]   And if they don't, I can't rescue them
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.960]   if they don't wanna be rescued.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.440]   - So you mentioned the ministry, Michelle,
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.160]   and I really wanna talk about that.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.040]   Can you talk about how you got involved
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.680]   in setting that up and also how it works?
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.800]   - Yeah, so the first lady at my church,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.960]   we would have women's ministry meetings every month.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   And she wanted to have a five-minute financial minute.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.520]   And that turned into 10 and 15 and 20.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.240]   And she said, "Well, you need to just have a whole ministry."
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.920]   And so that's how it developed.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.080]   And I wanted to create something that was lasting
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   because when you have workshops
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.280]   and people get so excited, and then what happens?
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   They don't act on the information.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.040]   And so I wanted to create a program
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.920]   that we would build relationships.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.280]   And I modeled it after Alcoholics Anonymous
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.080]   because they have sponsors,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.400]   people who they can call when they're at their lowest.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.520]   So we created a money program where there's money mentors.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.360]   And so they help them budget.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.800]   They actually even call people when they're in the store.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.720]   Like someone's in the store, like Target,
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.120]   and they're like spending,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   and they will call their mentors like,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.760]   "I don't know what to do."
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.480]   And we've actually had people talk,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.520]   like, "Put the card away, go to your car."
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.080]   And it's a year-long program.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.120]   We start in January, we go to December,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.640]   we take August off for a vacation.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.240]   And every month for two hours, sometimes three,
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.120]   'cause I hang around afterwards,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.160]   we have topics, get out of debt,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.480]   how to save, better decision-making, investing.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.320]   And they stick around.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.560]   And now with the pandemic, we went virtual.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.440]   Do you know, we have 200 people on average on Zoom
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.920]   for two hours listen to about money.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.680]   Regular, not y'all brilliant people.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.840]   I mean, just regular trifling people for two hours.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.360]   And we build relationships over that year.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.720]   So by halfway through, they trust us.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.800]   We say, "Don't spend, don't give that to that kid."
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.720]   And they actually act on that.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.280]   In this program, people's credit scores go up
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.600]   on average 50 to 100 points.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.880]   During 2021, so on average, on a year,
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.160]   we have anywhere from 150 to 200 people.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.600]   We have a really large church.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.040]   And you don't have to be a member of our church, it's free.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.080]   But during 2021, during the rough time on the pandemic,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.840]   people in this group, this one small group,
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   got rid of $1.2 million in debt.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.080]   That's amazing.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.640]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.360]   And so as a part of that program,
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.560]   is the prison outreach part,
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.000]   where my husband and I go into state prisons in Maryland,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.600]   men and women, and it's part of a re-entry program.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.760]   So it's a five to six week program
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.840]   where we go inside the institution for two or three hours
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.520]   and teach workshop classes
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.560]   to people who are about to be released.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.800]   And so that's, it's a comprehensive, you know,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.680]   and the money mentors stick with the program.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.000]   So we have, you know, several dozen people
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.280]   who we train to help talk to people.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.240]   And they're not accountants,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.200]   they're not showing them how to do Vanguard
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.040]   or anything like that.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.440]   They're just like, "Where's your budget?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.520]   "Where's your budget?
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.560]   "Why did you go shopping?
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.040]   "You don't need to buy nothing for Christmas.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.800]   "That kid don't need no more shoes."
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.720]   That's all we do, to free up money
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.080]   so that they can save and invest for their future.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.600]   - So I'd like to talk about
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.120]   what works in financial education.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.800]   So it seems like you feel like
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.080]   that sponsorship kind of buddy thing really works.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.320]   But I'm wondering if you can just talk about it
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.680]   in your experience,
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   what sorts of teaching resonates and helps improve outcomes?
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.480]   - Ah, that's such a good question.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.840]   You know, obviously I like to tell a lot of stories.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.560]   I think the more personable you make it, the better.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.720]   I love Pristina.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.080]   I go to her all the time
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.640]   because of the way you talk to people.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.920]   I think what we have to do is,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.520]   it's not about dumbing down,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.920]   but like this conference, I'm like so geeky
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.560]   and I'm laughing at the beta jokes
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.760]   and the alpha jokes and stuff.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.760]   But regular people, we not regular, y'all.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.160]   They won't get that.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.840]   And it's very off-putting to them
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.240]   because A, it makes them feel like they're dumb.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.680]   And secondly, it goes so over their head
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.040]   that they're not hearing the basic message,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.400]   which is all y'all need to do is put money
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   in a low-cost index fund and just let it go.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.240]   They don't hear that.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.640]   They're so intimidated.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.560]   And so I think it's very important
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.920]   that we meet them where they are
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.040]   to encourage them to do the things
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.080]   that they need to do to grow their money.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.320]   And I wish there were so many more people here
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.840]   at this conference who would get
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.120]   that they can do this thing
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.000]   if they just be present.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.640]   And we make sure that we're talking to them
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.840]   in a way that they understand.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.120]   - I wanted to, I just have one more question
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.760]   and then I want to open it up to the audience.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.040]   So if you have a question for Michelle, you can queue up.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.240]   We'll be bringing the microphone down there.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.280]   I wanted to ask you about the themes
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.520]   that you find yourself coming back to again
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.560]   and again in your work.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.800]   I think Jason Zweig has said there are like,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.080]   how many columns, Jason?
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.120]   Is he still here?
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.680]   (Jason mumbling)
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.000]   He feels six columns, six topics
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.240]   that he revisits with kind of a current events hook.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.800]   When you reflect on your work,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.640]   are there any key themes that you find yourself
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.960]   coming back to again and again in your articles?
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.800]   - Most definitely.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.240]   And by the way, like, first of all, Jason is so cute.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.080]   But.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.240]   He's just so cute.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.520]   (Jason mumbling)
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.360]   - Okay.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.760]   (laughing)
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.160]   And I just love his work.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   I'm such a big fan.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.800]   So the key things, 'cause here's the thing.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.680]   I love this conference and it's all about, you know,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.080]   like, I don't do spreadsheets.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.600]   I don't do any of that.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   But the thing that'll get some people to where you are
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.080]   is debt, number one.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.400]   This is a country that loves debt.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.320]   So I revisit debt, spending choices,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.000]   better decision-making, love and money.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.280]   I heard someone talk about having this panel
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.560]   about couples and money.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.120]   A lot of reasons why people don't have the money to invest
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.640]   is that they're on different pages with their spouses.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.320]   Because we tend to marry on money.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.160]   Opposite, it's just how it works.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.200]   I could not be married to another Michelle.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.400]   So my husband is way different than me.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.440]   Now, fortunately, we are on the same page money
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.320]   'cause I very purposely wanted to marry a cheap man.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.880]   Which is very unusual.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.200]   Even as a young child, I mean, a young adult dating,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.640]   I knew the kind of man I wanted.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.920]   Like, I didn't want somebody who had fancy cars.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.440]   I could tell y'all a story like that.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.880]   But anyway.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   So love and money, kids and money, and estate planning.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.920]   Those are the topics I try to revisit.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.000]   And I hate debt so bad.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.640]   I mean, if debt was a person, I'd slap it.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   I just, I feel like this country
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.880]   could be in such a better place
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.360]   if we just had a healthy hatred for debt,
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.120]   even for our mortgage.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.280]   Even for the things that we think are worth the debt.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.720]   I'm not saying don't use it.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.960]   Obviously, most of us cannot buy a house outright.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.560]   But you ought to hate signing that thing so bad
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.920]   that you want to get out of it so bad.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.040]   And when I write columns about pay your mortgage
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.000]   after we retire, the hate mail I get,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.840]   mostly from financial planners.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.400]   It's crazy because I can't stand that mortgage.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.560]   And if I don't have a mortgage in retirement
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.960]   and things happen like it is now,
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.360]   I can weather that storm a little bit better.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.080]   If my kids can go, my youngest is a teacher.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.600]   She can live on that teacher's salary a little bit better
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   'cause she don't have any student loan debt.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.720]   And so savings, so important.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.040]   And I'm gonna throw in income building,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.000]   making sure you get enough knowledge
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.240]   and get in the right career
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.540]   so that you can have the right income.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.600]   Although, I don't ever say everybody has to be in STEM
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.000]   or something like that because I believe
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.200]   we all have a gifting for where we ought to be.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.720]   And I want to teach people how to live
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.960]   whatever they decide that that's where they want to do.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.320]   My kid wants to be a teacher.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.240]   I'm not gonna discourage her from doing that.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.440]   I'm gonna teach her to be a really good money manager.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.520]   And then estate planning.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.680]   We had talked about this in the last panel.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.960]   And someone said that it's so depressing
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.320]   because it's about death.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.200]   That's not how I teach it.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.520]   Estate planning is about life.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.520]   It's not about death, it's about the living.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.440]   What hot mess are you gonna leave
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.940]   if you don't do your estate planning, right?
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.960]   I mean, it's about the relationships.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.580]   And then people do estate planning
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.280]   and they want to punish adult kids
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.740]   or people who weren't doing what they're supposed to do.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.520]   But when you are gone and you leave something
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.120]   to one child and not the other,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.520]   who are they gonna blame?
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.920]   You are dead.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.120]   They're not gonna blame you.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.880]   They're gonna somehow feel something about their sister.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.760]   My husband and I update our wills every once in a while.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.280]   We're in the process of doing that now.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.600]   And we sat down with our oldest
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.060]   who's gonna be our personal representative in Maryland.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.180]   And we were talking about everything.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.440]   We got to the house.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.880]   Now, we have a beautiful one acre property house
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.300]   and spent all these years trying to pay it off,
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.140]   love my house.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.260]   And I wanna have a paid off house for somebody
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.560]   so they don't ever have a mortgage.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.400]   And I don't care which kid get it,
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.840]   but somebody ought to have a paid off,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.580]   keep that house, right?
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.860]   She looked at me, she said, "We selling the house."
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.440]   "You can't sell my house."
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   And I'm like feeling all, I'm crying.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.400]   Like, "Why you don't like my house?"
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.840]   You know, black people don't have no property.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.880]   I just, I went there, I went there, you know?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.200]   And she looked at me like I was crazy.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.400]   And my kids have great relationship with each other.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.320]   She said, "Mom, if only one of us
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.020]   "was able to have the house,
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.680]   "that's gonna make the other two feel some kind of way.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.460]   "Even if we aren't fighting,
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.140]   "you're gonna be really resentful.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   "And I don't think that's what you wanna leave."
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.800]   I was like, "Darn if that kid gonna sell my house."
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.360]   But she was right.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.520]   It's just a house.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.720]   We have taught them to be property owners.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.040]   So she said, "We can sell it, split it three ways.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.120]   "And we've taught them to handle money well enough
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.660]   "that they could take those proceeds,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.140]   "buy a house of their own,
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.740]   "almost, if not outright, close to it.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.760]   "So they will be a mortgage-free loan
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   "before my husband had been mortgage-free."
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.400]   And she's telling me all this, 27.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.460]   And I'm a little proud and a little pissed off.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.840]   But she was absolutely right.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.800]   Plan for the living.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.880]   What kind of relationships?
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.720]   If you don't have a good relationship,
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.480]   you need to get some therapy.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.360]   Some family therapy so that you all can come together.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.760]   I had a, I was speaking to some seniors at my church
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.400]   and she was saying her son is her representative,
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.480]   but she don't like his wife.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.520]   And his wife has a lot of influence over her husband.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.760]   Of course she does, she sleeps with him.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.800]   So I said to her, I said,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.900]   "You need to get in good graces with that wife
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.040]   "because let me tell you, it's not just about when you die.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.600]   "If you can't take care of yourself
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.760]   "and he has to take care of yourself,
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.520]   "you're gonna want her to wanna take care of you.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.420]   "So you better build a good relationship with that wife
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.260]   "so that he will take good care of you
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.640]   "and she will take good care of you."
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.480]   And she was like, I said, "Plan a lunch."
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.280]   She's like, "I'mma plan a lunch."
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.680]   - Beautiful, thank you, Michelle.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.780]   I am loving this.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.420]   (audience applauding)
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.280]   We're gonna take some questions from the audience.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.240]   I'll put the mic right here.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:26.620]   - Thank you so much for being here.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.680]   Welcome to the club.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.180]   - Thank you.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.240]   - I've been reading your column.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.400]   I live in Washington, D.C.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.320]   I've been reading your column
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.160]   since I got out of school in the mid '90s.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.400]   I know who Big Mom is.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.280]   And I'm grateful for you and for this whole community,
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   neutral arbiters of exceptional information with no angle.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:51.120]   And my question is, when you look around this room,
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.320]   there's not that many women
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.480]   and there's not that many people of color.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.240]   And I wonder what do you think it's gonna take
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.200]   to bring more diversity into this group
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.800]   that's, as far as I could detect,
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   not prejudiced, not mean, extremely generous with no angle.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.720]   It's been beneficial to me as a military widow
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.000]   when I was seeking out a half dozen advisors,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.200]   each of whom told me something wrong,
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.400]   illegal, incorrect for my situation.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.300]   And this is where I got my information.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.600]   And I wonder, how can we do that for a bigger population?
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.120]   - Yeah, that's such a great question.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.720]   And I spend a great deal of my time
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.040]   trying to get minorities and women involved in this.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.920]   I think just, we can have big things like this,
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.260]   but within your community, just identify populations
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.000]   that you can go and talk to, community colleges, colleges,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.600]   and have just simple forums and meet them where they are.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.760]   So you might start off how to pay off your student loan debt
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.040]   but then you throw in some investing stuff, right?
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.840]   You just have to go out there and be very intentional
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.360]   about trying to reach those groups.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.400]   The program in my church, we've got young people,
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.280]   old people, white, black, so, and as you can see, I do,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.360]   one year I was teaching off of the Matrix.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.040]   And so we all had dressed up like the Matrix.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.800]   I had leather pants on, I can't fit them now,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.600]   but I had them on then.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.160]   One year, the whole thing was the Black Panther.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.840]   So we got all the outfits
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.480]   and we just do really entertaining, interesting things.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.200]   We do kids and money sessions.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   And so that's, you just have to go in,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.320]   find those pockets of communities, set up programs,
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.200]   but make it so that it's not a one-off thing.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.560]   Is there a community college with young adults?
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.880]   Try to go there and see, maybe they've got a math class
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.160]   or algebra class or whatever,
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.280]   and just see if you can kind of incorporate
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.360]   some of this stuff within that system.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.160]   And I think that's how you bring them in.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.120]   But you're absolutely right, we have to get,
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.720]   and I think Vanguard could probably do a better job
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.560]   of reaching out.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.880]   It's a great product just for those kinds of folks.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.680]   And the entry point maybe needs to be
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.360]   a little bit better, right?
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.840]   In order to get the, you know,
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.200]   administrators, you gotta have some kind of money, right?
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.400]   Now, my daughter, she has an investment account with,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.480]   she's got a retirement account
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.080]   and investment account with Vanguard.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.280]   And it was a hard sell.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.040]   Now, you see the house she grew up into.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.680]   It was a hard sell for her.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.280]   And she has three funds, 3,000 each,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:36.200]   'cause she had $25,000 saved up, y'all, 25!
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.440]   I did not know that!
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.800]   So she has an account.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.880]   And unfortunately, we set her up
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.080]   just as the market started to go down.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.720]   And so when we're in the kitchen preparing something,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.440]   she comes in, 'cause all my kids live with us,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.680]   that's another story, which is great, we love it.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.520]   We love that they live with us.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.160]   She comes in and she kind of looks at us
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.920]   and she just cast her eyes.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.200]   And she's like, "You're making my money go down."
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.440]   But I said, we keep saying, "Be patient, be patient."
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.640]   So that's how you do it.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.800]   You do it within your own life,
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.080]   you do it within your community,
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.440]   and you have to go to where they are.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.360]   - Thank you so much for being here.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.720]   You mentioned helping folks with causes,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   or a purpose you value, like buying a home.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.680]   And you also mentioned the importance of spending choices.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.720]   How do you navigate or offset
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.240]   the fungibility aspect of money?
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.760]   So someone brings to you something you value,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.160]   like buying a house, but you're aware of spending choices
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.040]   in their life elsewhere that you may not approve of.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.960]   So in one sense, arguably, you're possibly enabling
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.560]   something you don't support.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.280]   - So when you, okay, wait, go back to the mic,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.360]   'cause I think I wanna make sure
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.400]   I answered your question right.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.240]   So are you saying if someone comes to me
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.080]   and they wanna buy a house, but they're not a good spender,
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.320]   I mean, let's say, how do I,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.120]   should I tell them to go ahead and get a house,
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.480]   or is that what you're asking me?
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.320]   - Let's say if they told you they wanna buy a crazy SUV,
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.840]   you might say, I don't support that,
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.800]   I'm not gonna lend you this money.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.120]   But they're borrowing from you to buy the house,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.880]   while with their own separate funds, buying a crazy SUV,
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.960]   or whatever other choice that you may not support.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.320]   Because funds are fungible, one could argue
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.560]   they're using their own funds for the house,
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.360]   and using your money for the crazy SUV.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.040]   - Okay, I see that.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.560]   Well, yeah, that doesn't happen with us.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.240]   So the times that we help people
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.360]   with like a down payment on a house,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.000]   we have looked at their situation,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.720]   and we see their spending pattern.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.960]   So if you were buying that kind of car,
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.520]   we're not gonna give you the money.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.520]   So we are very discerning on who we choose to help that way.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.560]   So we do look at your life challenges,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.800]   and we do say to people, no, you got this over here,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.960]   you need to wait.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   So we are very discerning, and I'm very like,
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.920]   no, I'm not gonna give you that.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.040]   You're spending it on this very expensive car.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.000]   I have a 2006 Honda Odyssey, and duct tape is my friend.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.720]   So I'm not gonna lend you money for a down payment house
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.840]   if you got like a Lexus, that's just not gonna happen.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.720]   So I'm looking at your life choices as well,
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.760]   before I give you some money.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.000]   And my husband, me more than my husband,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.040]   he's the good cop, I'm the bad cop.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.400]   I'm like, that's a dumb decision.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.840]   I'm very candid.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.120]   And when people, for example, whenever a form,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.400]   not this form, but they come up and say,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.760]   you know, should I buy a house?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.600]   And the first thing I ask them is, do you have debt?
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.040]   And if you have consultant loan debt,
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.240]   I said, absolutely not, absolutely not.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.720]   You get rid of that debt first.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.200]   And the whole audience, not you all,
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.560]   'cause y'all are from, you know.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.840]   They're like, oh, how could you have ownership?
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.760]   You have to buy a house.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.440]   I said, you already got a house,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.200]   especially if the debt is like three, you know,
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.560]   six figures student loan debt.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.520]   Absolutely not.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.840]   And, you know, one woman came up
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.440]   and she wanted to upgrade to one.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.680]   She had a townhouse and an upgrade to another house.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.520]   And between her and her husband,
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.280]   they had $200,000 in student loan debt.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.920]   I said, are you insane?
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.200]   No, you're not gonna live in that house.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.800]   Oh, the boys need more room.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.040]   How much room do they need?
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.520]   Right, you know, there's not enough backyard space.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.880]   Take them to the park.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.240]   So I'm very opinionated.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.360]   And I think that a lot of people just need to hear that.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.440]   I mean, in our space, sometimes we're a lot like it depends.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.360]   I'm not a depend kind of woman.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.160]   I'm like, don't do that, that's dumb.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.400]   And I'll help you show you another way.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.560]   So that's not a situation I find myself in.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:41.840]   - Michelle, is there a curriculum
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:46.120]   or the teaching material that you're using
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.000]   that we could use to get this message out?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.400]   - Wow, so we are working on that right now,
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.880]   as a matter of fact.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.800]   It's been taking forever.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.680]   My job has been all-consuming since the pandemic,
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.840]   but we are working on a curriculum
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.920]   that is both biblically-based and a secular version.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.000]   And my book before this last one
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.320]   called "The 21-Day Financial Fast"
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.400]   is biblically-based about a fast, the Daniel fast,
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.480]   where you don't eat fruits and vegetables and no meat.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:22.360]   And so this fast is that you don't spend on anything
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.880]   that's not a necessity, and you have to use cash.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.280]   And so based on that book and my last book,
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.920]   we have created a curriculum.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.400]   And it's a year-long curriculum.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.960]   The prison curriculum is much shorter.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.120]   So we are working on that.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.560]   We hope to get it up by 2023,
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.760]   and it'll be accessible through our website.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.480]   - Let me ask you a quick question, Michelle.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.520]   I want to ask about your charitable giving,
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.080]   because that's something we've talked about,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.600]   your approach to charitable giving.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.040]   And I specifically like your thoughts
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.000]   on a really big-picture question
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.080]   is figuring out how much is enough
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.160]   for you and your family and your needs
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.320]   versus how much you want to direct to charity.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   You told me that giving and having a giving plan set out
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.880]   and having it be automatic makes you better
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   about managing your household finances.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.160]   So can you talk a little bit about that?
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.360]   - I would love to talk about that.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.200]   So my husband and I are tithers,
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.360]   so we give 10% of our gross income,
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.320]   'cause my pastor says,
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   "Do you want a gross blessing or a net blessing?"
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.280]   And we decided to make giving
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.480]   as important as paying our mortgage.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.440]   So it's not last, it's first.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.400]   And because we give 10%,
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.360]   we got to really manage that 90%.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.480]   And boy, do we manage that 90%.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.480]   Now, I come from a low-income background.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.240]   My grandmother didn't do tithing.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.360]   She couldn't afford it.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.480]   But my husband and I decided that we have been so blessed.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.400]   We both came from childhoods that didn't have a lot.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.760]   His parents divorced and kind of left my husband
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.920]   on his own when he was like 14.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.360]   Not on his own, but they kind of disengaged from his life.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.760]   My father tried to kill us.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.360]   My grandfather was an alcoholic.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.040]   And here I am at the Washington Post
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.840]   and my husband's working in a great government job
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.360]   as a manager, and we make an income
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.640]   that we never, ever dreamed that we would have.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.080]   And we thought, what are we gonna do with this?
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.320]   Buy more cars?
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.760]   Buy a bigger house?
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.040]   That can't be all.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.520]   Give it to our kids.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.560]   I want them to work for their own self.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.080]   We're gonna leave stuff to my kids,
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.200]   but we don't wanna leave them so wealthy.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.640]   I love when Warren Buffett says you wanna give them enough
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.520]   that they can do something,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.640]   but not so much that they do nothing.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.320]   And so we decided that a 10% plus another two
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.240]   to other charities that we believe in
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.600]   has to be a priority in our life.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.200]   Give first, then you manage the rest of the 90%.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.400]   And we belong to a church that has a Shabbat center
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.080]   where we give to the poor, we feed the hungry,
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.640]   so we make sure that our money is being used well.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   We have a jobs program, we have the prison ministry,
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.760]   I do the financial, we have 100 ministries,
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.200]   so we are well aware that our money is in good use.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.920]   And so I think for all of us,
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.680]   we have to make giving a priority.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.640]   And not, I mean, we get a great tax break,
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.000]   but not just for the tax break.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.840]   And it's so interesting.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.040]   Y'all talk about tax harvesting and all that kind of stuff.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.360]   I don't wear none of that stuff.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.600]   I just give.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.880]   That's a huge tax break.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   And I don't have to worry about taxes.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.360]   And I'm helping our community.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.960]   And so I believe that who much is given, much is required.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:48.360]   It ought to be a key part of your financial life.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.640]   Who are you helping besides,
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.000]   not just yourself or your immediate family,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.640]   but outside of that sphere?
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.960]   Who are you impacting?
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.560]   What kind of financial legacy
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.520]   are you leaving for other people?
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.560]   It's gotta be key.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.240]   The government can't do it all.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.680]   And we know they don't even wanna do it.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.160]   So it's up to us to help and make sure that our money,
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.960]   the thing that you work so hard for,
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.320]   is helping people live a better life.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.600]   And so that is key part of who we are.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.760]   We give to our church.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.280]   We give to, you know, public radio.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.440]   (audience applauding)
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:32.160]   - Michelle, your giving is close to my heart.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.080]   I really appreciate it.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.840]   But before I get into a point I was gonna make,
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.360]   I have a 2003 Honda Odyssey.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.560]   You know, in terms of making a difference,
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.960]   the topic that you just teed up
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.200]   is exactly what I came up to talk about.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.160]   I've been very blessed myself.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.120]   Struggled through life.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.040]   Had a very stressful career.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.240]   Two-time cancer survivor.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.440]   And I made it to retirement.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.120]   And so I'm blessed as well.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.160]   The thing that I decided to do when I retired
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.440]   was to set up a private foundation
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.280]   to help cancer patients and their families
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.200]   because when they're undergoing treatment,
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.960]   can't work, can't pay their rent,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.240]   can't put food on the table,
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.800]   can't pay utilities, things like that.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.560]   And so I found that very rewarding.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.800]   And I'm not encouraging anybody here to do the same thing
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.320]   because there's a lot to that.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.000]   But, you know, bless you for the work that you do.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.760]   What I did wanna suggest to this group,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.040]   because it's available through Vanguard,
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.760]   through Fidelity, through Charles Schwab,
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.320]   the donor-advised funds, the DAFs,
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.160]   these are things that if any of you are fortunate enough
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.680]   to be in the position where you do have money
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.760]   and you do have the willingness and the heart to give,
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.840]   by all means, you can do this, and it's quite efficient,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.520]   and it cleans things up from a tax perspective, so.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.480]   - That's great, I'm glad.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.320]   And thank you for what you're doing for those families.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.520]   Michelle, I wanna thank you on behalf of Bogleheads
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.160]   for making the trip to speak with us.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.560]   I have loved hearing from you.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.280]   I think the audience has, too,
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.440]   based on the reaction that I've been hearing.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.440]   Thanks a million for doing this.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   (audience cheering)
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
