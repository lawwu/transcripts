[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.260]   Well, when it comes to global missions, we Christian hedonists camp on a couple of incredible
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.680]   texts in the Psalms.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.400]   There we find a couple of texts that have deeply shaped Pastor John and how he thinks
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.120]   of the church's mission to the nations.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.880]   The first one is, of course, an Old Testament prayer for the nations.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.620]   Let the peoples praise you, O God.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.840]   Let all the peoples praise you.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.600]   Let the nations be glad and sing for joy.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.360]   That's Psalm 67 verses 3 to 4.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.360]   Let the nations be glad.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.040]   I mean, that's our prayer.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.720]   But we don't just pray to this end because the psalmist also delivers a command to the
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.400]   people of God in relationship to the nations.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.400]   It's this, quote, "Sing to the Lord, bless his name, tell of his salvation from day to
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:58.600]   day, declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples."
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.200]   That's Psalm 96 verses 2 and 3.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.560]   So let the nations be glad as they see our gladness in God.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.000]   That's a powerful tandem of texts.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   The first text became the title of Pastor John's classic book on missions, Let the
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.080]   Nations Be Glad, of course.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.380]   And the second text, the command, was Pastor John's choice text that he preached recently
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280]   at the 2021 Getty Sing Conference in Nashville.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.600]   Here's Pastor John explaining the connection between our joy, our singing, and our reach
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.200]   to the nations.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.040]   And he begins here with an illustration from his marriage.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.320]   Have a listen.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.020]   When we traveled together, which we did yesterday coming down here on the plane, and which we've
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:58.640]   done for 52 years together, I have said to her countless times in airports, on elevators,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.480]   "I'm so glad that you can go with me.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.000]   It makes me happy that we can do this together."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   And do you know that never in five decades, never once has she said, "You are so selfish.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.680]   It makes you glad that I'm along.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.060]   Makes you happy that we can do this together.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.380]   You are so selfish.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.520]   Makes you glad.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.560]   Makes you happy."
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.120]   Never once has she said that.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:00.360]   The reason that this conference exists is found in the answer to the question, "Why
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.800]   would she never think to say that?
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:14.500]   Why would it never enter her mind to say that?"
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:27.720]   The worth and the glory that we see in others is measured by the gladness that we have in
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.400]   their presence.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.440]   My pleasure in her presence is a tribute.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   It's not selfishness.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.640]   It's celebration.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:59.080]   My pleasure is a measure of her treasure to me.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.880]   And so it is with God.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:21.200]   In worship, God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him and His presence
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.840]   as our dearest friend.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.520]   God has given singing to His people as one of the most precious and powerful expressions
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.000]   of our gladness in His glory.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.840]   It's the gladness of Godward singing, especially through suffering, as Johnny said last night,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.480]   say it again.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:02.360]   It's the gladness of Godward singing, especially through obedient suffering, that makes God's
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.240]   glory shine most brightly.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   So for those two reasons, I'm thankful to be here, and this conference exists.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.720]   Now my task as part of it in these last few minutes is to draw out some of the connections
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:35.000]   between the gladness of Godward singing and the finishing of the great task of the great
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.040]   commission to gather God's elect from all the peoples of the world, or as Isaiah 35
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:51.020]   says, to see all the ransomed of the Lord come to Zion with singing and everlasting
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.320]   joy upon their heads.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.840]   So I have five connections to draw your attention to.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.720]   I'll just point to them, and you can trace them out later, and I'll give you a scripture
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.760]   for each one.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.400]   Number one, the gladness of Godward singing sends the lovers of Christ to the nation.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.640]   Psalm 96, sing to the Lord, bless his name, tell of his salvation from day to day, declare
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.000]   his glory among the nations.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.920]   While you're singing, do that.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:38.800]   His marvelous works among all the peoples, for great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:48.440]   How many thousands of missionaries have heard their call in Psalm 96?
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.280]   Declare his glory among the nations.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.720]   Do you hear that?
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.760]   Declare his glory among the nations.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.640]   Sing to the Lord a new song there to them.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.760]   Every year Bethlehem, when I was a pastor there for 33 years, we would have a pastors,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.520]   I mean a missions conference, and the close of the missions conference we gave an invitation
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:21.160]   to all those who in the conference for the last two Sundays had heard or felt what they
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:31.180]   sensed to be a compelling leading of the Lord to cross a culture, to take the gospel, spending
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.480]   the rest of their lives to do it.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.440]   That's a pretty high standard for an invitation.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.600]   We would sing, we would stop, there would be no music and no head bowed and no eye closed,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.120]   and I would wait.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.660]   And Chuck, who helped me with that for so many years, sitting over there as a precious
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:01.560]   partner in it, our worship leader, and they'd come.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.680]   They'd just get up out of their seats and come.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.600]   Twenty, fifty, one time two hundred.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   Then we'd get them connected with the nurture program, and then we'd close with a song.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:30.320]   We rest on thee, our shield and our defender.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.360]   Thine is the battle, thine shall be the praise.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:46.600]   When passing through the gates of pearly splendor, victors we rest with thee through endless
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   days.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.320]   Because, that's the hymn that the five Ecuador martyrs were singing when they were speared
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.240]   to death in 1956.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.560]   And I believe with all my heart that as they walked to the front, uncertain and struggling,
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.840]   but sensing God's leading to give their lives to world missions, that call was sealed with
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.720]   that song.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.920]   Singing sends lovers of Christ to the nations.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.800]   Yeah, I'm going to end it abruptly.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   That's from John Piper's message titled "We Win the World with Singing," a message preached
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.280]   at the Getty Sing Conference Global 2021 Conference in Nashville, Tennessee last November.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.800]   You can find the whole sermon and audio and video at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.400]   Again, the message title, "We Win the World with Singing."
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   Thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.040]   Our clips are crowdsourced.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.580]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life, and we share that clip with the
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.580]   APJ audience.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.920]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.560]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.160]   the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:00.280]   Send the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.240]   Well the church is fractured.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.040]   Over the past couple of years, we've experienced a lot of division among Christians at the
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:14.560]   levels of networks and denominations and even inside local churches and friendships.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.820]   So is this division a good thing?
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.480]   Is it only a bad thing?
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.040]   Will division work for the church's greater purity and final good, or will division work
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:29.880]   to the church's final detriment and to the lessening of her testimony in the world today?
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.600]   It's a relevant question, a great question.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   It's up next time.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.720]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.680]   We are joined in studio again with Pastor John when we return on Friday for that question.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.160]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.660]   [END]
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:59.460]   [ Silence ]
