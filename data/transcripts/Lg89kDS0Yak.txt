[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780]   What sins disqualify a pastor for life?
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.780]   Are there any?
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.480]   It's a great question I've wondered about for a long time and today it's a question
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.760]   from a young woman we get to address now on the podcast.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.960]   She writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.520]   My church is currently discussing hiring a man to join our church staff full-time.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.080]   However, this man recently left another church because of adultery.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.240]   He was caught, repented, and asked for forgiveness.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.200]   I certainly believe Christ forgives adultery.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.760]   But from reading the passages on church leaders in the pastoral epistles, I don't see how
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   it could be God's will for him to continue pastoring."
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.880]   What are your thoughts?
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.040]   Is repentance enough to make this man a leader in another church?
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.680]   And more generally, what sins, if any, disqualify a pastor for life?
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.880]   What I can give here is my considered opinion, informed, I hope, I believe, by 50 years of
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.000]   watching ministry and being in ministry and 50 years of soaking in the Bible.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.520]   But I can't give you a word that I think has the absolute backing of God's authority behind
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.920]   it with regard to any specified amount of time that might need to elapse before somebody
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.440]   could prove himself a new person and thus able after adultery to serve again.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.880]   Because I don't think the Bible gives a clear instruction about how a disqualified pastor
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000]   can become qualified again.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.240]   I'll try to unpack that as we go.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.760]   I don't think this is the kind of issue where the church as a whole will ever have agreement.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.000]   And that's not simply owing to the fact that the Bible doesn't give pointers.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.520]   It does, I think, and I'll try to share those.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.760]   It's owing to how incredibly diverse our minds and hearts are when it comes to prioritizing,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.040]   one, the protection of the flock and the honor of the gospel on the one hand, and two, on
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.920]   the other hand, acknowledging the preciousness of God's patience and compassion and forgiveness.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.440]   People assess relationship between these two, severity that says, "You will never touch
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.960]   this flock again.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.120]   This flock is too precious and the gospel too precious for the way you have dishonored
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120]   it."
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120]   That's kind of one mindset.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.320]   And the other says, "No, no, no.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.680]   We must exalt in God's patience and compassion and forgiveness."
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.560]   And even this restored pastor can model that.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.960]   You hear the two poles that we feel, and both are real.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.200]   They're both biblically rooted and genuine.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.440]   And the question is, how do you bring them together in making decisions like this?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.280]   I don't think that means that each local church or each denomination shouldn't come to one
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.820]   mind about how they will, in fact, function in the calling and the keeping or not of elders
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.920]   and pastors.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.280]   I think every local church should pray and think and study their way through the Scriptures
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.580]   into a position from which the elders can work in unity with regard to these kinds of
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.440]   things.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.260]   The fact that it may be different from some other churches, I think, is almost inevitable,
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.760]   but I think a church has to function, and so there needs to be a biblical effort to
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.240]   say, "Well, here's where we stand, and we're not going to elevate this to absolute law
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.160]   for all churches, but we must function.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.360]   Here's what we see in the Bible."
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.520]   So having said all that, let me give you my opinion and a few biblical pointers.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.120]   The very fact that in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 there are criteria for eldership, pastorate,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.080]   shows that churches are to put in the necessary and difficult effort.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.680]   We're put in a position that's necessary because of those texts and difficult regarding
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.120]   the fact that some men are suitable and others are not for the role of pastor.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.280]   That's what qualifications mean.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:42.200]   This necessarily means that you can be a completely forgiven sinner walking in a way that is pleasing
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.280]   to the Lord and not be qualified to be an elder, and not just because you don't have
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.080]   the gift of teaching or the wisdom of governance or leadership.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   So the first thing to say is that churches and Christian leaders in particular need to
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.180]   have the emotional backbone to live with the blowback of making difficult decisions like
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.300]   this, because there will be, especially in our day where we don't like the idea of saying
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.140]   that some Christians qualify for this and some don't.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.880]   That's the first thing to say.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.320]   Emotional backbone is going to be essential.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.160]   Second thing to say is that there is a vast difference between being forgiven and being
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.400]   trusted.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.240]   Forgiveness is based on the blood of Christ and can be granted and received instantaneously
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.320]   upon genuine repentance.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.720]   But being trusted is not based merely on the blood of Christ.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.440]   It is based also on proven trustworthiness in life.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:03.520]   Adultery committed against one's wife is just about as bad a blow against a man's trustworthiness
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.900]   as could be delivered.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:14.440]   She may, I pray she would, have the grace to forgive him if he is repentant.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:24.320]   But the restoration of trust with her, with others, with a church, may take years, and
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.200]   he should be in no hurry to expect it or demand it.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:40.040]   His whole bent should be toward winning it by an absolutely trustworthy behavior that
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.140]   goes the extra mile to demonstrate his self-control, his radical devotion to Jesus, his willingness
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.640]   to gouge out his eye rather than lust, and his deep, heartfelt commitment to his marriage
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.240]   vows and his wife no matter what.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.160]   Here's the third thing I would say.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.480]   Adultery and other sins committed after one's conversion and well into one's Christian life
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.420]   are more serious indications of unfitness for ministry than are sins prior to the new
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.600]   birth and the new creation in Christ.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:26.640]   Adultery committed after conversion is a sin not only against a wife and against God, but
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.080]   against our new nature and against the indwelling Holy Spirit and against the whole drift of
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.520]   Scripture in describing the new person as a new creation in Christ.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:44.000]   Adultery after conversion is sinning against the glory of the light of Christ, whereas
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.280]   before conversion we were all in spiritual darkness.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.600]   We were acting according to our nature.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.000]   And when a pastor commits adultery—a pastor now, not just a believer, a pastor commits
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.480]   adultery—he's sinning not only against God, not only against his wife, not only against
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.520]   the light of the biblical witness of the new creation in Christ, he is also sinning against
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:17.800]   the glory of the gospel ministry and sinning against the trust of a people of God and against
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.700]   the reputation of the gospel in the community.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:29.240]   And for these reasons, the issue of restoration is not an issue of forgiveness.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   That's a given.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.120]   That's just not the issue.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:43.160]   The issue is that the offense has been compounded by its deeply multilayered betrayal of God,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.760]   wife, Christian newness, the Holy Spirit, the people of God, the gospel, the reputation
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.120]   of the gospel in the Christian ministry.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   I find in talking to some fallen pastors, they're just oblivious of how serious this
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.880]   is.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.600]   The fact that these things did not suffice to keep this man out of bed is evidence of
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:18.640]   such profound unfitness for gospel ministry that the time and process by which he might
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.160]   prove himself a radically different man is long and painful.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:32.020]   The final thing I would say is what I wrote on this question 10 years ago, it was in response
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:39.440]   to how quickly some men have been put back in and really how quickly some men put themselves
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.480]   forward—unbelievable—how quickly they put themselves forward to be back in ministry
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   after adultery.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.240]   It's still valid.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.520]   What I wrote then is still valid.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.160]   I was looking at it just the other day.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.200]   What I've seen is this.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:03.160]   Men who have lived in deception and immorality and hypocrisy for a significant time and then
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:12.720]   are caught have hardened their hearts and dulled their capacities to repent for so long
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.480]   that their ability to see things for what they really are is profoundly impaired.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.400]   Their ability to see that they're calling themselves repentant, but they can't see.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.120]   They don't have the sensibilities that they've been deadened for so long, and so they are
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:35.680]   in no position—now mark this, this is really important—they are in no position soon after
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.520]   their discovery, they are in no position to make any good judgments about their fitness
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.240]   for ministry and what is good for the flock and the glory of Christ.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.120]   So here's what I wrote, and I'll end with this.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   Here's what I wrote.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.680]   I said, "A man who commits adultery in the ministry should immediately resign and look
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   for other work, and he should make no claim on the church at all.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:09.400]   He should get another kind of job and go about his life humbly receiving the discipline and
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.240]   the regular ministries of the church, whether in his former church or in another church.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   If he returns to ministry, it should be after a long time of humble, contented acceptance
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.640]   of a new way of life outside the official ministry of the church."
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.120]   Sobering counsel, very relevant for the church today.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.520]   Thank you, Pastor John, for walking us through that.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.680]   And thank you for listening.

[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.040]   Well is the Christian's heart deceitfully wicked?
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.080]   You've heard that phrase, "deceitfully wicked," probably in the Old Testament from the prophet
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.400]   Jeremiah, but does such an indictment apply to the regenerated Christian heart?
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.440]   It's a great question, and it's up next time on Monday.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   [END]
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   1. What is the Christian's heart deceitfully wicked?
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   2. What is the Christian's heart deceitfully wicked?
