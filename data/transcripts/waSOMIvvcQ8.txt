[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What are a few things that you do and or avoid
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.920]   in light of what you know about these endocrine disruptors?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.820]   And by the way, it goes without saying
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.080]   that you're in spectacular cognitive and physical shape
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.520]   for any age, but it's really remarkable.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.200]   I feel comfortable sharing this
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.300]   because someone else published it online recently.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.560]   You are soon to enjoy your what birthday?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.440]   - 89th.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.200]   - 89th birthday, amazing.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.560]   And with all the talk about longevity,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.840]   cognitive and physical longevity,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.480]   everyone's thinking, including me, like, what does she do?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.600]   Well, she avoids all these endocrine disruptors
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.240]   and she has a wonderfully rich life
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.720]   of curiosity and other things.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.480]   But yeah, what are some other things that you do
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.160]   and avoid in light of what you know,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.100]   for which there may or may not be a controlled study,
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.720]   but I think we're all just curious.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.220]   We'll frame this as what you do.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.540]   - So water, our water, I worry about the water.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.960]   I studied water for a long time in my past life.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.040]   So we actually distill our water.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.980]   So we have a tabletop distiller.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.080]   My husband, Steven, cleans it out.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.680]   There's a lot of gunk in it, by the way,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.020]   even though it's San Francisco that has clean water,
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.580]   at the end of the day, after you've distilled the water,
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.420]   there's a lot of gunk.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.920]   - So you distill the water, so this is not reverse osmosis.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.200]   - No, distilling.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.040]   - Okay.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.640]   - Yeah, so it's steam distilled
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.440]   and then it condenses in a glass container.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.200]   And then we put that in glass containers in the fridge.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.160]   And so, and it tastes really good, by the way,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   really, really, somebody was just over and he said,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.320]   "This tastes like melted snow."
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.160]   - Hmm.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.000]   - I thought it was lovely.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.160]   - And you use that for drinking, for coffee, for tea,
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.400]   for cooking too, if you make rice, you're using distilled.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.720]   - Actually, no, no, but for ice cubes.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.280]   And you know, whenever I can think about it,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.400]   we can't use too much 'cause you'd be too busy.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.240]   You always did.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.080]   - Right.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.520]   - But he does it once a day, it's just the two of us.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.360]   So water is important.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.920]   We try to leave our shoes at the door.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.000]   - Tell me about that one.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.060]   - Well, dust that you bring in contains a lot of the,
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.200]   particularly the PFAS chemicals.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   And so that's actually, I'm not 100% good on that,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.860]   but we try to do that.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.280]   And I'm careful with the products I put on my face.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.760]   I check them out the way I suggested,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   you know, environmental working group.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.640]   And I go to the farmer's market.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   I always buy organic, always buy organic.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.720]   But I know that's a cost issue for some people
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.120]   and an availability issue for some people.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.360]   But in San Francisco, you can do that.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.040]   Some areas where I don't do more of what I should,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.960]   I think I'm starting to be aware of the chemicals
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.380]   in clothing.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.760]   We haven't talked about that, but there's a,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   turns out there's a lot of, particularly in,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.320]   it's a problem for workout wear
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.800]   because you're absorbing so much,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.880]   you're sweaty, you're hot,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.160]   and you're bringing these chemicals into your body.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.880]   And that may be one of the interventions that we do,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   get a bunch of athletes to use safe clothing
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.040]   and traditional clothing
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   and see what their body burden is.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240]   That's how you know.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   - So erring toward cotton as opposed to synthetic materials.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.360]   - Right, and the dyes are important.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.680]   So you don't want, you want maybe plant-based dyes.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.160]   It's not my area of expertise.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.120]   I have a colleague who I work with on this
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.080]   and I'll go with her advice.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.240]   But I'm just saying that's another area
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.440]   that I think people will soon be paying attention to.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.460]   There's also the area that is much more difficult,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.900]   which is what's in building materials and furniture.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.960]   But a lot of these PFAS and the flame retardants
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.860]   are in our furniture and in our building materials
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.040]   and trying to think about how to build.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.560]   I was asked about safety in a new village
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.480]   that's being built in California, by the way.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.560]   And it's really challenging to think about
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.860]   if you were gonna do this right
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.160]   and you were gonna build a town that was toxic free,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.300]   how would you do that?
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.560]   I'm thinking about that.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.520]   - I'm thinking about the opener of the Simpsons
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.200]   and doing the exact opposite.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840]   Where like in the opener of the Simpsons,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.000]   there's like a three-eyed fish
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.540]   and there's the chemical plant.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.380]   And I'm just thinking,
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.560]   you just look at the opener of the Simpsons,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.900]   you do the inverse of everything that's there,
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.800]   the inverse of everything that's there,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.440]   including alcohol intake,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.960]   which is robust on the Simpsons.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.720]   But interesting.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.040]   So, and when it comes to food sourcing,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.080]   like non-fruit, non-vegetable food sourcing,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.520]   is there anything we can do?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   I mean, it's so hard for people to get eggs from farms.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.160]   I mean, you can, if you go to a farmer's market,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.360]   but this stuff can get pretty tricky, pretty expensive.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.480]   And most people listening are not gonna be
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.120]   living in Sonoma where they might have a neighbor
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.640]   that has chickens or something.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.320]   It's a hard problem.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.560]   - It is a hard problem.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.560]   And I think maybe people asking for it more would help.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.100]   I don't know.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.480]   I mean, in San Francisco,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   I'm lucky 'cause I can just get, you know,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.680]   just on the phone, fresh direct order,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.360]   and I know it's okay.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.400]   But I know that's not the case everywhere.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   So I think being aware, honestly, is a really big step.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.920]   If you are aware that this is something you want to change,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.340]   you will find ways to change it.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.100]   - It's interesting because a few years back,
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.600]   there was a lot of discussion about dyes in children's toys,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.140]   in particular toys from overseas, right?
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.400]   Remember, kids are not, you know,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.600]   babies are always gnawing on stuff and teething in.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.880]   And there was a lot of attention like,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.520]   "Hey, like what's in these sippy cups?"
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.200]   And my understanding is toys and sippy cups.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.640]   And my understanding is that BPAs
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.320]   were banned from sippy cups.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.160]   - Phthalates.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.060]   - Phthalates, excuse me.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.900]   - Based on my work.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.720]   - Based on your work.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.560]   Thank you so much.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.280]   Thank you for the clarification, truly,
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.040]   and for the work that led to that.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.560]   We know that baby skin is more absorbent than older skin.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.540]   We know, and so there are literally laws in place
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.520]   and restrictions in place to make sure
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.820]   that some of this stuff is minimized in young kids.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.360]   But then we sort of, after age 12,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.000]   we're kind of like, "Okay, well, it's a free-for-all.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.200]   It depends on your budget, where you go."
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.820]   And so we can't rely on governing bodies to do this.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.640]   But I think it's a useful conversation,
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.000]   especially given your relationship to Scandinavia,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   which is a fun one to elaborate on,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.520]   to illustrate some of the discrepancy
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.340]   between the U.S. and Europe.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.220]   What sorts of chemicals are banned in Europe,
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.240]   in food, in lotions, et cetera, that you're aware of,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.860]   that are prominent here in the U.S.?
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.980]   Maybe that's a good filter
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.040]   to place some of this choice-making through.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   - Europe has had a policy called REACH,
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.460]   and under REACH, you have to show
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.680]   that a chemical is safe
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.600]   before it's put into the marketplace.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.360]   So the way our system is here,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.200]   it's put in the marketplace,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.800]   and then if somebody gets worried about it,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.680]   they might do a study, they might find harm.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.600]   Remember how long it took me to find that phthalate connection?
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.240]   It was 10 years.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.780]   Two studies, 10 years, $10 million, by the way.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.360]   So if you're gonna wait for that,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.680]   I don't know, given the number of chemicals out there,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.660]   80,000 or more, forget it.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.300]   So I think the REACH policy of testing
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.140]   before something's put in the market
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.460]   is making a big difference in Europe,
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.340]   and I think that's one reason why they're much better off.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.460]   - Are those animal tests,
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.740]   or animal and human tests that they're doing over there?
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.260]   - Whatever defines safety.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.500]   It depends on the chemical,
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.900]   it depends on what the product is.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.820]   I can't answer that in general.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.120]   - So that might be a good avenue
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.580]   for changing legislature here, right?
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.460]   To install something similar to REACH.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.680]   - Absolutely, but it's not gonna happen, I don't think.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.520]   - No? - No.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.460]   Because there's too many forces against that.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.800]   It's very, very hard for manufacturers to make changes.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.260]   I'll give you one example.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.200]   So you know that, you might not know, but should know,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.340]   that phthalates are very prevalent in the hospital setting.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.300]   If you think of a tube, you know, to dialysis,
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.640]   to chemotherapy, to IV, that's all phthalates, right?
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.800]   And that's going into your body.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.240]   And there was recently a bill passed in California
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.840]   that DEHP could not be in IV bags.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.320]   It's fantastic success.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.240]   - In the actual bag? - Yes.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.960]   - The bags could not contain these endocrine disruptors?
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.440]   - Yes, DEHP specifically. - DEHP, okay.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.760]   - Diethylhexyl phthalate, the most anti-androgenic phthalate.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.300]   So that was a great step forward,
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   but that's like one chemical, right, in one product.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.340]   And that was a battle.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.340]   So you see how hard it is to do this, extremely hard.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.220]   There's a company, Bbron, which makes hospital products,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.080]   and they are very forward-thinking,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.760]   and they set up a factory in Florida
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.480]   to make alternative IV bags
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.880]   out of another product, polyolefin.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.720]   And the problem is that we're not sure
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.840]   about the safety of polyolefin.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.920]   So it gets really difficult.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.440]   You know, you can say, "Remove DEHP,"
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.280]   but now we scientists have to say,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.480]   "What does it mean for a chemical to be safe?"
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.820]   And we don't know that.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.560]   I don't mean to disillusion you and your listeners,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.200]   but that's a huge challenge that we're up against.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.940]   We know it's safer, we know it's safer,
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.640]   and we know what the bad actors are,
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.980]   and we know the things we don't want to be exposed to,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.360]   but we have to be careful when we think
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.040]   about what do we want to put in instead.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.320]   - If people are interested in limiting their exposure
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.540]   to these endocrine disruptors,
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.460]   one of the key questions that's going to come up again
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.120]   and again, especially in light of PCOS and sperm counts,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.100]   is we can't control what happened to us during pregnancy.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.560]   But once we have some sense of agency
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.880]   over what we put into our body
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.740]   and how we put it into our body,
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:42.400]   do you think that there's plasticity
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.480]   and resilience to this system?
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.800]   So, you know, God forbid, if somebody was exposed
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.200]   to a lot of these things early on, can they, you know,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.760]   by making changes, can they rescue themselves
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.600]   to any degree? - No.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.440]   - No? - No.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.800]   - So it's really just dependent on what your parents did.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.480]   - Yes, that's not to say that your own exposure
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.840]   cannot change things further and make things worse.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.540]   But here's a fact.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.540]   If a male's mother smokes when he's in the womb,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.020]   then he has a, this is a Danish study, by the way,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.200]   50% reduction in sperm count.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.880]   - If his mother smoked while he was in the womb,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.440]   how much smoking are we talking?
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.240]   - I don't know, I don't remember.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.200]   But the reason I bring this up is because
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.240]   there's nothing he can do to change that, okay?
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.600]   If he smokes as an adult, he has, I think,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.680]   a similar reduction in sperm count.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.480]   He can stop and his sperm will be restored.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.280]   He can get his sperm health back.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.520]   But whatever happened in the womb stays in the womb,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.160]   if you will, so it's developmental.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.220]   It's not going to, you know, it's gonna be there for life.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.920]   And that's true for the brain as well.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   So I think anybody who's thinking of conceiving a pregnancy
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.280]   or pregnant has a responsibility to really learn
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.540]   how to reduce their exposure.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.960]   Because these things are, by the way,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.920]   passed on for several generations.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.400]   It's your child and your child's child,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.080]   because the germ cells for your grandchild
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.140]   are going to be carried in within your child.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.600]   - So germ cells are not germs as in infectious germs?
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.440]   - Right, right, right.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.040]   - It's the cells that will produce the egg and sperm,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.000]   that germinate, hence the word germ.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.480]   - So it's a huge responsibility.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.020]   And I think people should take it very seriously,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.540]   that they have, you know, they're going to be affecting
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.120]   the health of subsequent generations.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.980]   Some labs say it's seven generations.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.000]   I don't know if that's true,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.260]   but certainly three generations.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.980]   (upbeat music)
