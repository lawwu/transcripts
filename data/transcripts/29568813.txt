[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.060]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.660]   of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.340]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.780]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.020]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.700]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.000]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.040]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.140]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.140]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.780]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.140]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.400]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.400]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.200]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.840]   Well friends, I'm super happy to welcome you
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.400]   to this podcast on what is here at my house,
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.780]   a really cold January day.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.420]   And lots of you, I happen to know, are under snow cover,
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.940]   and I'm really jealous about that and slightly bitter,
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.780]   but I'm happy for you to have some snow to play in.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.820]   I remember Januarys from my college years
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.200]   as sometimes full of snow.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.980]   I went to college in North Carolina,
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.100]   and I remember one year that we had snow
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.740]   every Thursday in January.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.140]   It was delightful 'cause we had people to play with.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.780]   But another thing that I remember about Januarys
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.060]   when I was in college is something
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.680]   that my college called a January term.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.900]   It was a time sort of in between the fall semester
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.920]   and the spring semester when we all came back to college,
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.560]   but we didn't jump into our 15-week semesters yet.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.500]   We were all ready to come back and be with our friends
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.940]   and probably do something with purpose,
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.580]   but not necessarily to jump into something
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.780]   that was in our major or was highly academic.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.300]   And so they had these things called January terms,
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.300]   and it was for a short-term pursuit.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.460]   So it lasted about a month,
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.400]   maybe six weeks, a short-term pursuit
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   of something interesting that you might not study otherwise,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.700]   something totally outside of your major,
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.060]   maybe something not even particularly academic,
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.980]   but it was a cool way to get back
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.740]   into the routine of college,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.140]   back with your buddies,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.340]   doing something together that was interesting,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.560]   but not as academic as we had had before.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.340]   So I want us to talk about together today
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.340]   ways to jazz up January as homeschoolers.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.780]   And I've got one of my favorite homeschool friends,
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.540]   Amy Jones, with me today,
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.100]   and we are gonna brainstorm some ways
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.300]   to jazz up January for you and your homeschooler.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.380]   Amy, thank you so much for coming.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.780]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.620]   Talk about getting out of the doldrums.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.940]   This is gonna be a delightful conversation.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.540]   - I'm gonna enjoy it.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.140]   You always have such great ideas
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.500]   and such fun memories to share
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.980]   that I know that all of our listeners
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.980]   will be eager to capitalize on your brainstorming with me.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.900]   Let me ask you,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.360]   what were January days like for you as a homeschooling mom?
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.820]   I know your kids are grown now,
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.060]   but those January days are really memorable.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.940]   Did you and your children ever get stuck in a rut
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.340]   in January?
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.940]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.960]   I mean, I used to think you had the summer
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.340]   and to look forward to a new school year
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.900]   and there was all that energy and excitement to get back,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.540]   but then somehow January,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.900]   in Tennessee, it's not snowy most of the time.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.740]   It's just gray and cold and wet
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.540]   and you're coming off Christmas,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.980]   you're a little tired.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.980]   Usually there's somebody that's got sniffles or sneezes
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.660]   and you haven't seen your buddies in a while
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.980]   and you probably overspent a little bit at Christmas.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.660]   A little depleted in all areas.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.660]   And then just looking,
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.660]   one of the things I think that it discouraged me at times
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.220]   that I allowed to discourage me was,
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.660]   oh, what we didn't get done last semester,
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.500]   we need to get done this semester.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.340]   And I just remember feeling burdened by anticipating,
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.360]   oh, we're already behind the eight ball.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.520]   And that was unfortunate because that's not true at all.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.540]   The law directs our steps.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.100]   But yes, we would be,
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.620]   I would sense the doldrums invading our home
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.020]   and those early January days, absolutely.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.040]   - So how did you get back to that?
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.260]   We always talk about the daily delight of family learning
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.540]   and it is delightful, but when you're in the doldrums,
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.380]   well, Amy, how did you and your family get back
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.740]   to that daily delight of family learning?
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.800]   - You know, it really started with me
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.040]   and of course with my husband
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.700]   that I really needed a perspective shift myself
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.100]   and just spending a little time, extra time with the Lord,
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.900]   I think helped me be relaxed,
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.240]   not feel anxious or overwhelmed or down
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   and to just recognize all that God had already been doing
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.540]   in our home, that sort of energized me.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.460]   And it also just not feeling isolated.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.500]   I usually reached out to a few
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.020]   of my close homeschool buddies and said,
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.020]   hey, can we get together and brainstorm a few of these
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.580]   like something fun to look forward to?
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.460]   And believe me, when you get all these homeschool moms
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.100]   together, just two or three ideas start popping,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.060]   things that they didn't have time to do, they'd love to do.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.860]   So that really energized me.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.100]   And then also just having a really honest conversation,
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.940]   especially with my older kids, like, hey,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.500]   what are some things that you would love to try or do
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.540]   or kind of miss out on?
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.480]   What kind of things would you enjoy?
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.160]   And really trying to hear what their hearts desire is
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.080]   because they get a little down
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.820]   and some people are a little more affected
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.220]   by all this dreary days.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.220]   - That's true.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.060]   - And with them and just really hearing
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.620]   or recognizing they're lonely right now.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.980]   And we need to, even if the house is still,
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.620]   there's still Christmas ornaments stuck around.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.340]   - Yes, yes.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.180]   - It's been vacuumed in a while, whatever.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.340]   We need to kind of plunge into our mental health
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.340]   and get just kind of reset button with just recognizing
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.620]   God is with us, he's got something great planned
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.340]   and being open, what is it?
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.620]   And just trying to kind of incorporate some things
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.900]   that we were hoping to do, didn't get to
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.980]   or just some new adventures that come up.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.140]   So those were the kind of things that we did.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.620]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.620]   I love that you are encouraging us all to be real,
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.180]   to recognize that we all take stock
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.260]   and tend to major on what went wrong
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.960]   or what we didn't finish or what we're disappointed in.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.620]   And that our children sometimes do that too.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.220]   And they look back and think, oh, I left that undone
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.800]   or I could have done a better job.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.660]   And now there's a whole new semester that has,
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.160]   wow, some really daunting things ahead of it.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.420]   This is gonna be hard or I'm not,
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.460]   I feel unsettled or uncertain about this.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.860]   And just looking at one another
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.420]   and recognizing that there's some anxiety,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.020]   whether that's because of seasonal affective disorder.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.020]   I had one daughter who was very affected by long dark days
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.540]   and that dreariness of the weather seemed to work its way
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.540]   into her mindset and into her perspective.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.540]   And it really does affect our willingness to do hard things
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.600]   and her willingness to work.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.180]   And so I really appreciate you being upfront and real
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.180]   and saying, look, mamas, look around at your house,
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.460]   look around at your children, look into your own heart
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.100]   and realize that you might need to do something different
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.580]   to shake things up.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.580]   And I love your suggestion that you ask your students,
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.760]   especially your older students, what are you missing?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.580]   What is something that you've always wanted to learn
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.660]   or you feel like you're missing out on
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.300]   because I really liked that.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.540]   And we're gonna explore that in a few minutes
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.180]   because sometimes what we come to this podcast for
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.260]   is concrete, practical ideas.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.100]   And so we're listeners, we're not gonna leave you
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.900]   just feeling better about feeling bad.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.100]   We're gonna actually give you some good ideas
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.020]   about how to jazz up your January.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.960]   Let me ask you, we talked about some of the signs
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.620]   that you might need a January term,
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.280]   that you're just not maybe as motivated as a mom or dad
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.400]   or your students aren't motivated
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   or you're seeing the downside of everything
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.200]   or you're just, you're tired.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   I think it's really smart to acknowledge that the holidays,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.900]   while they may be holly and jolly, drain us.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.920]   They drain us a lot of times.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.600]   I feel like sometimes we need a little space in January
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.020]   just to get back to equilibrium.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.840]   - Yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.680]   I think we do.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.300]   I think I remember a conversation,
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.300]   I think James Dobson did a long, long time ago, of course.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.840]   And he said, one of the primary quote, task, jobs,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.260]   responsibilities of a mom at home is to manage the holidays.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.120]   So that should be one of your,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.960]   that's one of your key responsibilities.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.960]   And it does, frequently doesn't get recognized.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.440]   And because it's Christmas and everybody's happy.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   But a lot of times the mom is doing the scheduling,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   the cooking, the arrangement.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.300]   And I think post that holiday season,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.040]   even moms need a little tender loving care
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.000]   to recognize, hey, we just came off a holiday
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.320]   that could have gone well, we've had them go well.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.040]   And just to give yourself a little space,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   but also think, I just keep thinking of renewing my strength
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.600]   and just saying, Lord, give me the new strength,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.080]   new excitement, joy, because that is,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.360]   as the doldrums come in, you can,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.060]   you counter that with your own joy and thankfulness.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.680]   And I don't think we need to be happy, happy, happy,
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   pretend, but sometimes I would kind of allow myself
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.040]   to get a little blue when I thought,
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.260]   you know, a good cup of hot cocoa will go a long way.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.080]   And I think those simple little things
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.780]   that we can add to a day, just change it up a little bit,
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.760]   gives people a sense of a little brightness.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.720]   And I think we as moms have the privilege actually
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.440]   of bringing that into our home, that there's a lot of hope
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.480]   and there's a lot of joy to look forward to.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.880]   So yeah, you're right, you're right about that.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.080]   - Yeah, yeah, I can close my eyes and see listeners
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.740]   out there waving their hands.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.440]   Yes, that's me, that's where I am.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.420]   Those are the signs that I need a January term.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.240]   I need something to jazz up January.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.200]   So let me ask you this.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.040]   What could, 'cause I told you what J term was like
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.760]   for my college, it was like four to six weeks
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.660]   of you signed up, it was a class, you did go,
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.360]   but it was stuff you probably would not have signed up for
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.120]   otherwise, it didn't necessarily fit in your major
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.840]   or anybody else's major maybe, but it was something
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.760]   that would pique your interest.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   What might a January term look like for homeschoolers?
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.040]   And maybe you don't agree, I think that this early part
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.640]   of January is the perfect time to try a J term.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   What could it look like for homeschoolers, Amy?
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.360]   - Oh, you know, I think it's really great
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.040]   to give yourself permission.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.680]   I think Lee even alluded to this.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.280]   You aren't governed by the curriculum.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.340]   You are the, you are the governor.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:05.000]   So I think it is really great to give yourself permission
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.680]   to say, okay, over the next two weeks before,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.380]   you know, challenge starts up or nation starts up,
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.320]   we are gonna really do some fun things.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   And this is, you've probably been maybe listening around
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.920]   or asking your students, hey, what are some things
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.480]   that you guys would like to do?
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.520]   And just sort of plunge in.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   I know for us, there were little hobbies
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.760]   that the kids really wanted to do,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.800]   but we quote, never had time to do.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.280]   So we did a little, I know my daughter
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.320]   wanted to make doll clothes.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.880]   You know, she was in the American doll phase of her life.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.400]   And so I just called some moms and said, hey,
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.840]   you have a girl, you know, this age, come over,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.520]   we're gonna have a couple of sewing days.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.880]   You're gonna make a pillow case.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.420]   I mean, I can make a pillow case.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.660]   (laughing)
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.760]   - Yes, yes. - I can make a pillow case.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.680]   And we just gathered, you know, materials
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.520]   and just had like a three day.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.060]   It doesn't have to be weeks and weeks.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.800]   You know, you can see Friday, we're gonna get together
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   and we're gonna show off what we're gonna make.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.600]   You know, we're gonna buy some fabric in.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   And I honestly was not the primary source of this.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.520]   I tapped my good friend who is a seamstress and said,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.700]   hey, would you mind moving it?
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.120]   I'll get the materials of you.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.760]   And she's like, I'd love to do that.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.720]   And one year I, some homeschool moms
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.420]   that were particularly good at like one made pies.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.320]   I said, hey, can we come over to show us how to make a pie?
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.760]   I'm not a good pie crust maker, you are.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.000]   And they're like, yes, one person loved making chicken
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.840]   and dumplings.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.360]   I said, hey, would you mind us coming over
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.780]   and we'll all bring some chicken or whatever you need
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.120]   and help us make dumplings.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   And you know, that's the kind of thing is to grab the,
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.900]   it's kind of recognized on what's in your very community.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.520]   You know, if you have someone that can, you know,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.600]   cut flowers or I don't know,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.040]   know how to clean a silver platter, whatever it is,
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.760]   it can be random, but just gathering people together
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.520]   and going, hey, let's spend like this next week or two
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.240]   and just tapping into each other's giftedness in it.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.940]   And one of the dads, he wanted his sons
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.640]   to know how to change the oil in the car.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.200]   So I said, hey, would you mind our sons,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.880]   if I gathered the sons together or our daughters
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.720]   to know how to serve the car?
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.080]   And he goes, I'd love that.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.200]   So he parked a bunch of you, we got some,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.440]   he was even instrumental in grabbing some widow's cars
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.960]   from our, we live in.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.880]   - Oh, what a great idea.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.040]   - Signing them up and just going through
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.400]   and showing everybody, this is how you do it.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.880]   And it was January, super cold, but they didn't care.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.120]   They love being together, being outside
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.740]   and the dad was just super good at that.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.960]   So I think just giving yourself a lot of freedom
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.120]   to look at the non quote, non-academic world.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.680]   I mean, we can do a lot of academic stuff too.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.800]   That's really fun, geography, deep dive into things
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.380]   that you've wanted to tackle.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.800]   But I think sometimes thinking a little outside the box
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.300]   and giving yourself permission to say,
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.520]   this doesn't look like school.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.540]   - Yeah, the tradition.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.800]   - Well, but the Lord, he's shaping all of us.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.840]   And part of it is building community
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.880]   and then recognizing each other's gifts.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.140]   So those are one part, but then there's the other part
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.200]   of saying, hey, we wanna,
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.160]   like if you have an essentials child,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160]   let's, we've been doing history and American history,
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   especially in cycle three this year, let's pick a person,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.440]   let's pick an event and grab some books and dress up,
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.280]   do some kind of write up a drama.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.800]   The other day, my daughter being homebound,
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.160]   they wrote a ballad, how fun is that?
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.800]   Dang it, and performed it all looking goofy and dressed up.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.600]   But it's that sort of thing like, okay, what do we,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.180]   like, is there a piece of literature?
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.200]   Like maybe we haven't done poetry, maybe we're all tales.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.080]   Maybe we wanna dive into a region
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   like we did a Japanese culture day
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.600]   where we had a tea party and all the children,
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.240]   including the guys, which weren't thrilled at it,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.880]   but dressed up, we ate squid,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.880]   which I don't know if they, that's very Asian day.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.640]   And it was so much fun because people brought,
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.520]   they each had to bring a fact
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.960]   or a artifact they'd created or part
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.360]   and just have like a sharing time of what we learned
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.040]   and really, and then we prayed for someone
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.120]   had been a missionary to Japan and we prayed for Japan.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.880]   And I thought, well, that was a really fun day
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.440]   of just focusing in on something
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.720]   and like those timeline cards are great for that.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.760]   - Yes, deep dive history is super fun.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.000]   Because a lot of times, I know with my kids,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.040]   during the semester, you're going through the work
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.600]   and you're touching on these things
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.000]   and my kids would a lot of times ask a question
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.760]   that I would think that probably has,
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.160]   that's an interesting tentacle
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.680]   and we could chase that a long way,
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.400]   but we also need to do X, Y, and Z today.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.120]   So maybe we're not, go back and find those things
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.160]   that your kids or you wondered about.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.520]   It is so nice to have the freedom to chase a rabbit
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.280]   as far as he'll run.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.280]   I just think that I loved what you said about,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.640]   so you've been studying, so your challenge A student
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.880]   is getting ready to study a certain region
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.640]   or draw in their cartography a certain area of the world.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.400]   Pick a country from that area
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.640]   and then do things you never would have taken time to do,
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.640]   like sew a costume or find out about the music
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.040]   from that country.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.560]   Like what's that country's national anthem sound like?
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.800]   What instruments do they use?
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.120]   Could you find some or make some and play it?
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.760]   It's just so, there's so many directions to go
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.000]   and I think when our children are little,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   they are interested in so many things
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   and they can riff off the main tune so easily,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.600]   they can find all of those side harmonies that go with that.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.920]   And I think that sometimes in our effort
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.480]   to help our children do hard things,
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.440]   we stifle the opportunity to chase
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.960]   all of the daily delights.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.040]   And so a January term is perfect
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.800]   for getting back to those daily delights.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.080]   Let me ask you this though.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.080]   What about, 'cause I hear what people's concerns might be,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   what about the challenge kids?
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.880]   All right, isn't it hard to take a break
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.480]   from the regular course guide for those older kids?
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.440]   I know it is, I've had that situation.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.400]   So how do we include our challenge kids?
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.320]   Amy, what would you say?
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.120]   Oh, I think again, one of the things
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.080]   is just helping them, like talking to them.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.600]   For my children, especially when they were at that age
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   of early middle school, high school,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.520]   they loved being with friends.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.480]   And I had little ones as well as high schoolers.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   And sometimes high schoolers,
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.960]   especially you have smaller children in the house,
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.240]   they get a little weary with the three year old
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   and just the rhythm of their little day.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.000]   No, we have nap time now, that sort of thing.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.880]   So what I really tried to do with at that level
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   is to just bring, be with people like--
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.320]   Yes, that's great.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.640]   And just let's have a chili cook-off.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   I mean, like I said, the dumpling person,
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.280]   we did a chili cook-off at their house,
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.120]   just where people came in.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.880]   Of course, the guys put through in hibernaries
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.600]   like you couldn't believe and--
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.040]   Oh, gosh, yes.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.600]   You have to eat the hottest thing in the world.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.720]   But just having a time where they're together
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   and science experiments that you have
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.320]   either done the previous semester
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.760]   or are participating this next semester,
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.360]   there is no rule against doing a science experiment
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.440]   multiple times.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.760]   So trying to saying, okay, we've got chemistry coming up.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.920]   Here's some of the experiments
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.120]   that we're gonna be looking at next semester.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.720]   Let's see if we can gather people together
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.840]   and see if we can do this.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.320]   Let's see if we can work this out
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.440]   or even doing something along the same lines
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.040]   that mirror that unit that you're doing.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.360]   Something that's a little bit hands-on,
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.600]   off the beaten path, but they don't feel like,
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.400]   oh, I'm gonna get behind.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.480]   And you're looking at spring semester,
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.600]   a lot of times kids are getting ready for the ACT or SAT,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.680]   they're getting all that.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.840]   So I think trying to,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.880]   for us it was being with other students
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.920]   that we were actually accomplishing quote, quote,
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.120]   accomplishing something, but we're also doing it
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.800]   in a really kind of lighthearted way,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.120]   like covering a piece of literature that we're gonna read
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   or something that even watching, we had our challenge class
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:22.280]   was mainly boys for a while and so we watched
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   Pride and Prejudice much to their dismay.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.960]   - Oh, yes, yes.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.760]   - But it was fun because we did it together.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   It was something they knew they were gonna be anticipating
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.800]   doing for the semester so they didn't feel
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.040]   like they had lost quote, time,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.520]   but also just hearing what are some skills
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.040]   they would like to do because we also,
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.120]   like one of our children, well, two of our sons
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.920]   were very interested in electronics
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.840]   and so they spent one particular period of time,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.520]   it wasn't the full weeks, but of spending half the day
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   building a computer and just sort of tinkering with it,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.240]   having friends over that knew the incident,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.440]   which I did not, what little things to plug in where
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   and what, and so one of our son's friends
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.640]   was really interested in shooting those little discs
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.600]   that flow up in the air.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.920]   - Oh, yes.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.200]   - They would go practice shooting in the afternoon.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.120]   - Shooting clays.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:37.000]   - Yes, and that was something they wouldn't have done
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.360]   if they hadn't had the extra time.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.920]   So just looking for avenues of their own exploring
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.200]   in a way that usually is with some other friends
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.000]   and we did, I know one good friend set up
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.640]   this very elaborate aquarium in his,
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.400]   so he all went over and I had a son
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.120]   that was really interested in that
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   and how did you go about it and just explained it to us,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.480]   just kind of shared with us how he went about doing this,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.240]   how he maintained it, what was required, he loved that
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.360]   and we did too, it was something that we wouldn't have taken
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.520]   the time otherwise to do and of course,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.320]   there's tons of volunteer things,
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.240]   they can volunteer at a shelter or you can,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.880]   anything like collecting food,
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.120]   get them involved in the community.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.880]   We have a couple of thrift stores here that love it
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.760]   when you collect canned goods or especially in January,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   coats, shoes, ministries that are really eager for you
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.520]   that need an extra pair of hands
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.880]   because usually volunteers aren't clamoring.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.520]   - In January, you're right.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.880]   The animal shelter here in our county really loves
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.640]   to have volunteers and so, or just calling and saying,
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.120]   hey, can you tell us a little more about the services
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.000]   that you provide?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.680]   Usually people are eager to share that.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.960]   Nursing homes, usually after the holidays,
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.120]   people aren't, they're lonely.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.600]   - Right, right.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.480]   - So just getting, tapping into opportunities for service
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.760]   or learning something that you've been kind of interested in
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.280]   or something that you don't know anything about,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.920]   those are really good thing.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   I just feel like it's a time you can say,
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   okay, in the next two weeks, we're just gonna do the,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.120]   if you wanna keep doing, whatever it is that you feel like
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.880]   we need to maintain this for the first two hours of the day,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.280]   we want the academics cared for.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.360]   But then this part of the day,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.760]   we're gonna be looking at these things
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.360]   or doing these things and for our older kids,
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   it was doing something with other homeschool kids
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   that seemed to be the most exciting thing for them.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.000]   I couldn't have, we didn't have a party every day.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.840]   (laughs)
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.920]   - Right, right, right, right, right.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.280]   - But it was fun.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   And usually moms in the same desperate situation
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.040]   are also, you pool your energy.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.000]   And of course that always, I know for me,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.400]   just being around other moms,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.360]   it always brought me a little bit out of my hole
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.480]   and was encouraging and laughing
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.880]   when things did not go right.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.960]   We could mutually encourage each other.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.720]   So that was always a good time.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.120]   - That is so good.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.520]   So many practical ideas.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.040]   I think that is awesome.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.480]   I think you have brought up some really good ideas.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.080]   If you've got little kids in essentials,
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.480]   then you know that you guys are working
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.720]   toward faces of history.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.120]   So a January term might be the perfect
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.280]   deep dive time for that.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.880]   And so beyond just researching your person
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.640]   and starting to write your paper,
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.360]   you're gonna do that, right?
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.640]   But do with a deep dive.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.200]   Like you were saying, learn how to sew the costume,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.920]   make the costume, go on a citywide scavenger hunt
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.640]   through all the thrift stores that you have
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.680]   to find implements for your costume,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.480]   old jewelry that you can sew into,
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.720]   the robes of a king or a queen.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.680]   You could write a play about your history person.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   My kids used to love to write plays.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.920]   Oh my goodness.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   At the drop of a hat, they would write play.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.520]   I remember one year for her birthday,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.960]   my older daughter, what she wanted for her birthday,
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.440]   she never had a regular birthday party in her life.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.240]   And what she wanted one year was
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.800]   she was going to write a play and all of her friends
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.280]   were gonna join her at her party and put on the play.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.560]   And so we kind of had to talk her down a little bit.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   Okay, so you're gonna come on this one day
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.720]   and you're gonna want people to know their lines
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.000]   and they're not gonna know their lines.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.400]   You can't, okay, so if we want to do a play,
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.080]   we've got to pick a story that people know
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.760]   and you have to let them have,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   I knew her controlling nature.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.480]   I said, you have to let them be able to control
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.800]   the script a little bit.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.280]   And so we actually did,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   we took the little red hen and rewrote it
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.920]   as the brave little princess.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.240]   And so she, everybody that was coming to her party
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.320]   had a part assigned.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.240]   We had a court jester and the court guard
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.400]   and the giggling princess and the pretty, pretty princess.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.960]   And so all the different people and, you know,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.440]   will you help me do this?
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.000]   No, and that, it was just, and so we acted out the play.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.440]   We still have the movie of that play,
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.880]   but what a fun January term for an eight, nine,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.220]   10 year old to do, you know?
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.200]   I loved your idea about volunteering.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.480]   That is so good.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.040]   Find out, you know, you can even do a study
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.680]   for your older students, your challenge students
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.800]   might want to do a deep dive into
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.100]   what is that local nonprofit all about
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.680]   and how did they become a nonprofit
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.200]   and what are the tax implications of that?
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.600]   And how do you set up something like that?
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.220]   And how do you assess the need?
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.580]   Learn about what they do,
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.380]   but also you could write an ad for that.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.780]   If you've got a child who is very creative writer,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.700]   write an ad for that nonprofit
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.180]   and research their business model.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.400]   I bet all of you live somewhere
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.900]   where there are tourist sites.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.220]   Now you might not think of it as a tourist site
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.840]   'cause you live there and you never go visit,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.100]   but be a tourist, become an expert on a local site
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.300]   or a historical site or even a business interest.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.580]   You know, the company that is the biggest in your town,
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.800]   find out about it.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.280]   Why might somebody want to come and see that?
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.740]   Interview somebody, you know, you could make a map.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.960]   We have national parks close to us.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.440]   You could make a map of that
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.100]   and see how well it matches the map
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.680]   that the park service made.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.060]   You could pretend to be a tour guide for that.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.580]   You know, we mentioned you could learn a song
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.100]   from another nation or about the instruments
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.180]   from another nation.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.460]   You could learn a craft.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.220]   I loved what you said about getting somebody to come
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.300]   help your girls make doll clothes.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.980]   Like I'm like you, Amy, I can make an apron
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.460]   and I can make a pillowcase.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.660]   One time I made a Hawaiian shirt for my husband
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.780]   and it was like the fluke of life
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.740]   that all the wild patterns matched up.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.500]   I don't think I could ever do it again,
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.820]   but I have friends who are beautiful seamstresses
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.940]   and I have a mother-in-law who knows how to knit.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.260]   And so, you know, if you wanted to learn woodworking
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.260]   or bonsai gardening or jewelry making or candle making,
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.280]   there are all kinds of things that we could do
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.000]   with our children.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.580]   And that's part of what I want to encourage all of us to do
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.580]   is to use the January term as a time of family learning,
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.140]   where you do something altogether,
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.420]   where everybody's not doing their own little thing
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.300]   and you're just the puppet master that supervises.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.340]   - Good, yes.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.020]   - I like it that we could all choose something
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.340]   that none of us know a lot about
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.480]   and we could learn in front of each other.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.100]   - That's such a good, that's a good analogy, Lisa.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.080]   That's right.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.480]   It's a great time to connect with each other.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.740]   And one, I remember one time we did just,
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:17.860]   we all created this goofy game, board game
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.980]   of all the quirky things that dad did.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.260]   And, but it was a thank you, you know, like dad,
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.140]   you know, take three steps back
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.820]   because we have to listen to dad sing that song again.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.480]   And we, by the time he got home, we all played it.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.900]   And it was just so fun,
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.500]   like that kind of thing where you're together
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.180]   or, you know, when you were talking, I was thinking,
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.780]   we had a good, a neighbor down the street
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.940]   that was a Korean War veteran.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.940]   And we all marched down, planned a day and interviewed,
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.720]   but what was it like?
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.260]   Share that story.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.500]   And there are people in our life, grandparents or aunts,
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.740]   uncles, even us as parents, you know, interviewing like,
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.040]   hey, what was, give some fun book you read
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   or something that you share together as a family.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.740]   I think that's a really good insight that it's not,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.920]   like you said, it's so easy to get just kind of isolated
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.840]   in your own world with your own work,
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.900]   even if you're living in the same home.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.980]   Really spend that time going,
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:35.900]   hey, let's all go and do this thing together
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.560]   and recognize the fun of being together.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.560]   And I think that's a great, great insight to reconnect,
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.540]   to join us. - Yes.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.660]   - And then just to be praying,
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.860]   one of the things that we did try to maintain
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.340]   was the same kind of rhythm of the home,
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.840]   even if we were doing different things
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.540]   like just having a time in a devotional.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.580]   That was always something,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.240]   there's always something fun to do that's different,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   but also some of my children really gravitated
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.400]   toward like the consistency of things.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.260]   So we did consistent mourning routine,
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.460]   you know, to pray together and be together and connect.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.020]   And even in those cases,
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.820]   you can change up your devotional time.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.120]   You can do, I know we did missionary stories
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.140]   for a couple of weeks.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.100]   - That's good.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.580]   - It's a little different, but I think there's,
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:40.180]   I think part of it is you don't have to be a camp counselor
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.180]   and all of a sudden you're exhausted after two weeks.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.100]   - Yes, that's great.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.220]   - But saying there are little things
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.340]   that don't require a tremendous amount of energy
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.180]   that can build and that your children,
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.420]   especially as they're energized,
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.140]   I found like I was energized.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.100]   The hardest thing was pushing, getting it going,
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.180]   but once you got it going,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.300]   then they kind of clicked in and took it on.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.500]   And sometimes in directions I wasn't anticipating,
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   but that was fine.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.100]   And so I think that helps to know,
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.780]   okay, let me just get something going.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.580]   And sometimes Lisa, things just fell flat.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.420]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.460]   I think that is, thank you for sharing that.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.620]   We don't want everybody to think that everybody else's stuff
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.700]   always works out well and mine hits a brick wall
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.620]   or a pothole.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.620]   No, I mean, I can remember things that did not go well
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.220]   or that we got in the middle of it and the kids were like,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.620]   why are we doing this?
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.940]   This is terrible.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.740]   I mean, it doesn't always fly.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.020]   But if you can laugh together and just that,
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.500]   and then just stop, there were times when I stopped
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.100]   and I would just look at them and say,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.940]   this is not really very much fun, is it?
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.380]   And they would say, no mama, it's not.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.980]   And I would just throw up my hands and say,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.140]   well, then let's go do something else.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.020]   This is not what it's all about because,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.580]   and this is important.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.780]   And this is kind of what I would like for us to end on.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.060]   What are we, why are we doing this?
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.180]   Why are we trying to jazz up January?
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.260]   It's not so that we can make ourselves
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.540]   crazy camp counselors, like Amy was saying.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.300]   It's not because we're trying to add something new.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   The whole point is that we want to make connections
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.740]   with our family.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.140]   We wanna do something different together.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.140]   We want to rekindle that spark, that joy of family learning
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:44.620]   that we've been trying to keep burning all this time.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.460]   We want to be together.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.220]   Here's the deal, homeschooling is a journey
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.820]   that we take with those we love.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.380]   And here's the truth and you all know it,
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:01.540]   journeys are more pleasant when we pace ourselves,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.900]   when we make use of all the rest stops as needed,
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.980]   they're more pleasant if we notice the scenery
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.620]   as we go along, journeys are more pleasant
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.740]   if we take time for conversation and reflection.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.380]   So jazzing up January is not one more thing
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.220]   to put on your list, mom, dad.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:28.180]   Jazzing up January is about taking a deep breath,
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.060]   finding joy in learning together,
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:36.060]   and giving yourself a little rest and reset
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.660]   before you jump both feet into second semester.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.220]   Amy, what last words of encouragement
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.700]   for weary homeschoolers looking for inspiration
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   do you want to offer?
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.620]   - Well, I think you just said it so beautifully, Lisa.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.060]   And I think that just recognizing
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.740]   we're sort of all in this little weary period together
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.380]   and that the Lord is our strength.
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.740]   He is anxious and eager to renew us.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.660]   And he has a vision for our next semester
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.780]   so we don't have to have it all together.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.440]   And I think you said, just like you said,
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.140]   just kind of stepping back and thinking,
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.500]   why are we doing what we're doing here?
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.180]   It's not to fill out a transcript at the end of the year.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.660]   It's really, there's so, so many,
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.140]   and we could have a whole other conversation about this,
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.980]   but there are hundreds of other beautiful things
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.620]   that happen within your family
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.980]   that you will reap the fruit of for years.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   That little goofy thing you did that didn't go well,
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.940]   you will laugh at that, like, oh yeah, mom, I remember that.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.100]   But that's a memory that holds together
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.520]   and that inspires your child as they have a homeschool
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.740]   and things can go well there,
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.120]   they can look back and go, yeah, we remember that.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   That you are building, I think of as we're building a family
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.760]   by the grace of God, that is a heritage.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.620]   We're building a heritage of generations as you,
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.020]   and you probably see this with your grandson,
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.500]   that your family, those little decisions,
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.080]   those encouragements, that togetherness builds,
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.200]   and it builds a heritage that your children reap
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.660]   in their families.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.520]   And I just think, just to know, to recognize,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.480]   it's happening, God is working,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.360]   and even if things don't go well,
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.240]   that God is working in your family
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   and that you can recognize, you can put things in priority
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.440]   according to his priorities and rest assured
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.820]   that other things will take care of themselves.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.660]   But first things first, second things come.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:01.360]   And I think I had to do that reset frequently,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.300]   not just in January, but frequently to remind myself
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.420]   of God's good faithfulness in our family.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.460]   - Oh, Amy, this has been so great.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.960]   You know what, I think this might be
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.820]   one of my favorite podcasts of all time.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.620]   I think this was a lot of fun.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.220]   It ministered to my soul.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.880]   I pray, listeners, that it has ministered to your soul

[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.400]   who will help you to gather the tools of exciting

[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.380]   your students' learning
