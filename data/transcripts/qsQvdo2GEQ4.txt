[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   One of the peculiar things about us human beings is our mortality.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   Ernest Becker explored it in general.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.160]   Do you ponder the value of mortality?
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.040]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.160]   I used to when I was about 12 years old.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   I wondered.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.200]   I didn't care much about my own mortality, but I was worried about the fact that if my
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.160]   consciousness disappeared, would the entire universe disappear?
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   That was frightening.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   Did you ever find an answer to that question?
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.440]   No.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.240]   Nobody's ever found an answer, but I stopped being bothered by it.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.720]   It's kind of like Woody Allen in one of his films, you may recall.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.200]   He goes to a shrink when he's a child and the shrink asks him, "What's your problem?"
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.640]   He says, "I just learned that the universe is expanding.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.120]   I can't handle that."
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.760]   And then another absurd question is, "What do you think is the meaning of our existence
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   here, our life on earth, our brief little moment in time?"
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.360]   That's something we answer by our own activities.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   There's no general answer.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.360]   We determine what the meaning of it is.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.640]   The action determined the meaning.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.080]   Meaning in the sense of significance, not meaning in the sense that a chair means this.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.280]   But the significance of your life is something you create.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   [silence]
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.520]   [silence]
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520]   [silence]
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   [silence]
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   [silence]
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   [silence]
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   [silence]
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   [silence]
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
