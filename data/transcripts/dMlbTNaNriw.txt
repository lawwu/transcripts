[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.920]   Judas is the greatest tragedy in human history because of his unparalleled privilege.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.220]   He is the ultimate in wasted opportunity.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.500]   He was greedy, he was a materialist, he was a money lover.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.800]   Most powerful demonstration of wasted opportunity ever.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.100]   Back in Matthew 16, Jesus looked right at Peter and said,
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.040]   Get behind me, Satan.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.380]   Satan put things in the mind of Judas.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.180]   Satan put things in the mind of Peter.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.320]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.820]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:01:07.800]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.880]   possible way he can.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:22.560]   I want to talk about the reality of deception from a very clear narrative in Scripture.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.100]   I want you to turn to Matthew chapter 26.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.920]   This is a tale of two preachers, and a tale of two sorrows.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's a tale of two men that you know very well.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.540]   Both had the most unique privilege.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.860]   Both had the most unique opportunity that has ever been given any human being.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.160]   Both were called by Jesus personally.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.680]   Both answered that call, and both followed Jesus for the duration of His ministry.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.880]   And both declared repeatedly their personal destiny.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:17.380]   All devotion to the Lord Jesus, one in spite of his wicked betrayal of the Savior, is considered
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:29.640]   so honorable a man, so exalted a person, that millions of people have been named after Him
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.600]   through the centuries.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.060]   He is loved.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.840]   He is considered noble.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.180]   He is considered a man of the Lord.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.400]   Some of you even have His name: Peter, rock, stone.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.360]   The other one is considered so dishonorable, so despicable, that even though His name means
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.200]   praise, no one has His name.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.100]   None of you do.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800]   None of you would name your child.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.040]   None of you would name your child with that name.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   The name means praise.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.220]   It's the most hated and reviled name in the world.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.240]   It has even been illegal in some European countries to give a child that name.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.840]   His name is Judas.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.140]   Now this is an important message because churches are full of Peters and Judases.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:44.020]   And I'm convinced that there are many Judases who don't know they are Judas.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.840]   People sitting side by side, hearing the same truth, having the same experience, seeing
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.960]   the same expression of divine grace and power in people's lives, serving.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.660]   But in the end, they're going to end up as far apart as one could ever be.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.380]   The story of both of these men is a mystery.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.420]   Both of these men is in Matthew 26.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.120]   Let's look at it.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.500]   In verse 6, when Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, a woman came to Him
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.800]   with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.640]   at the table.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.880]   But the disciples were indignant when they saw this and said, "Why this waste?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.300]   For this perfume might have been sold for a high price.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   Why this waste?
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.060]   For this perfume might have been sold for a high price.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.040]   And the money given to the poor."
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.840]   It says there that the disciples said, but in John 12:4 it says it was Judas.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.580]   It was Judas.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.180]   And why was he protesting?
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.820]   John tells us because he kept the money bag.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.580]   He had already decided to get out.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.520]   He'd already wasted three years, and he wanted to get as much money on the way out as he
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.220]   could.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.520]   Here is really the first revelation of his character.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.180]   None of the disciples had any suspicions of Judas, none.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.700]   But he reveals himself by being outraged that this is being wasted when the money could
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:34.020]   have been put in the bag, and he said that because he held the bag.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:44.780]   Verse 12, "When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare for my burial."
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.360]   This is another crushing blow to Judas.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.740]   Judas wants money.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.620]   He wants power.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.920]   He was riding the Messianic hope of Jesus to the end.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.900]   He wanted significance.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.940]   Primarily.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.940]   Primarily.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.440]   avarice or greed.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.120]   Now he hears Jesus is going to die, and Jesus is going to be buried.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.840]   And all his hopes and three years of his life chasing this dream of prominence and power
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.400]   and money is being smashed.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:35.160]   All this talk of death is more than he can stomach.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.380]   So in verse 14, "One of the twelve named Judas Iscariot, Judas from the town of Kerioth,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.180]   the only non-Galilean, went to the chief priests and said, 'What are you willing to give me
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.020]   to betray Him to you?'
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.700]   They weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.200]   From then on, he began to pray.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   He began to pray.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.440]   He began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus."
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   By the way, according to Exodus 21:32, thirty pieces of silver was the price of a slave.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:15.140]   We're now into the Passion Week, and it's Thursday night, verse 17, and they're going
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.380]   to go eat the Passover.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.640]   Verse 18, our Lord says, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.600]   says, 'My time is near.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.000]   I'm to keep a Passover at your house with my wife.'"
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.800]   Verse 19, "I'm to keep a Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.340]   The disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:42.100]   When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:50.840]   As they were eating, verse 21, He said, "Truly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.800]   It would be hard to imagine the shock.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.220]   The horror.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.900]   The disbelief.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.040]   And they had no idea who that betrayer would be.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   And they were honest enough with their own sinfulness to think it might even be one of
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.080]   them.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:25.600]   Verse 22, "Being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, 'Surely not I, Lord?'"
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   And He answered, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me."
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:41.520]   They dip bread in a bowl with a kind of a dip as part of the meal.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.840]   One who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.940]   The Son of Man is to go, just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man - " woe means
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.400]   to curse or condemn " - to that man by whom the Son of Man is to go.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.760]   To him the Son of Man is betrayed.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:05.580]   It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:15.220]   And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, "Surely it is not I, Rabbi."
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.520]   He needed to say that because everybody was saying it.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.200]   Jesus said to him, "You've said it yourself."
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.080]   I think that's the most horrible thing that could ever be said about a human being.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.960]   It would have been better for him if he'd never been born, because once born, he'll
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:42.700]   never die.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.820]   Judas can't hide from Jesus.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:55.000]   Down to verse 30: "After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.180]   Mount of Olives.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:05.020]   That evening that Passover was over, the betrayer was unmasked.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:12.240]   Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John to pray because He had to pour out His soul
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.040]   to the Father.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.800]   Starting in verse 36, you have Him come to Gethsemane, and He asks them to pray with
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   Him, but they all fall asleep.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   At that point, Judas goes into action.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:39.840]   Verse 47: "While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:47.920]   with a large crowd with swords and clubs, who came from the chief priests and elders
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.160]   of the people."
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.600]   Notice how Judas is identified, one of the twelve.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:04.320]   Always, always identified that way in the gospels, always, to underscore the shock and
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.940]   insidiousness of this man's betrayal.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:19.280]   At this point, of course, Satan entered Judas.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.400]   Verse 48: "Now he who was betraying Him gave him a sign, saying, 'I am the Lord of the
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.720]   saying, "Whomever I kiss, he's the one, seize him."
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:39.640]   Immediately, Judas went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi," and kissed Him repeatedly in
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.340]   the original.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:49.820]   Then Jesus had to him "friend" - and He used, by the way, not the normal word for friend,
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.460]   but associate.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:59.840]   "Friend, do what you've come for."
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:07.220]   Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:17.140]   At that point, we drop down to verse 57.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.040]   Those who seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:28.600]   And you know the rest of the story of the trials.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.420]   Go down to verse 65.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:38.920]   "Finally, the high priest tore his robes, and he said with regard to Jesus, 'He has
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   blasphemed.'"
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.460]   He has blasphemed.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   "He has blasphemed."
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.460]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.960]   Blasphemed by declaring that He is the Son of God.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.080]   "What further need do we have of witnesses?
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:01.700]   Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy."
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.960]   "What do you think?" they answered.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   "He deserves death," they replied.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.700]   Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him and said,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.800]   "Prophesy to us, you Christ, you Messiah,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:18.840]   who is the one who will save us from the evil of the world.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:18.920]   Who is the one who will save us from the evil of the world.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.960]   Who is the one who will save us from the evil of the world. Who is the one who hit you?"
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   The action of Judas led to this true blasphemy,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:40.140]   as the Jewish leaders blasphemed the Son of God.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:47.960]   Go to chapter 27, verse 1.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   Go to chapter 27, verse 1. Now when morning came, the people of Israel were in the midst of a great battle.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.160]   Now when morning came, the people of Israel were in the midst of a great battle.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.540]   conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:05.200]   And they bound Him, and led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate, the governor.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.160]   I just want to point out one word, verse 1.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   All, all the chief priests, all the Sanhedrin, a body of 70, all the elders of the people, all of them conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.960]   All, all the chief priests, all the Sanhedrin, a body of 70, all the elders of the people, all of them conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:20.600]   All, all the chief priests, all the Sanhedrin, a body of 70, all the elders of the people, all of them conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:30.680]   It was unanimous, a unanimous decision.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:40.680]   Then the tragedy of Judas comes to its crucial moment, verse 3. Then the tragedy of Judas comes to its crucial moment, verse 3.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.080]   Then the tragedy of Judas comes to its crucial moment, verse 3.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.360]   Then the tragedy of Judas comes to its crucial moment, verse 3.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:15:10.200]   Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, He felt remorse, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to that yourself. You gave us what we wanted. You led us to death. We are not guilty."
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.840]   "You led us to Jesus in the dark."
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.200]   He threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.360]   Very simple ending.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.800]   He went away and hanged himself.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:35.180]   He went away and hanged himself.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.460]   Chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "Not lawful to put them into the temple
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.700]   treasury."
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.720]   That is a statement of legalism like none I've never read.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.460]   They're about to kill the Son of God, but they're not going to break one of their ridiculous
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.460]   rules.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:03.120]   "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.720]   They would take the money and execute the Messiah, but not put it in the temple treasury.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:15.080]   So they conferred together, and with the money bought the potter's field as a burial place
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.180]   for strangers.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:22.860]   For this reason, that field has been called the field of blood to this day.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.100]   Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, and they took the
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.140]   thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one whose price had been set by the sons of
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.720]   Israel, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:45.300]   And by the way, that is from Zechariah chapter 11, but it mentions Jeremiah because Jeremiah
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:52.240]   was sort of the head of the list of prophets.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.600]   The Hebrew Old Testament list of prophets began with Jeremiah.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.180]   The horrible tragedy of Judas, the greatest tragedy in human history because of unparalleled
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.180]   opportunity.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.120]   "You know, our Lord said, 'To whom much is given, much is required.'"
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.260]   And he said that as a warning, as a warning.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.620]   You don't want to be too close to the truth because the implications of rejecting it are
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.960]   more severe than anything you could ever do.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.080]   Judas is the greatest tragedy in human history because of his unparalleled privilege.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.700]   He is the ultimate in wasted opportunity.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   He was greedy.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   He was a materialist.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.000]   He was a money lover.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.580]   He was motivated by a desire for riches.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:47.560]   So strong was his selfish greed that he could literally be in the midst of the living truth
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:53.140]   and go to hell on purpose.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.900]   He loved himself way too much.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:05.580]   He rejected the truth way too easily, and he resented Jesus much too strongly.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:19.160]   Most powerful demonstration of wasted opportunity ever.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.960]   That's Judas.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:27.000]   But our Lord has the writer weave in the story of Peter, so let's go back to chapter 26,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   verse 33.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.580]   "Peter said to Him, 'Even though all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away.'"
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:41.580]   He was boastful.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:50.740]   "Jesus said to him, 'Truly I say to you this very night, before a rooster crows, you will
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.340]   deny Me three times.'
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.360]   Peter said to Him, 'Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.'
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.580]   All the disciples said the same thing too.'"
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:11.940]   A shocking prophecy by our Lord.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:19.040]   As evil as was Judas' betrayal, as heinous and wicked as was his rejection of Jesus,
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.100]   his shame over Christ, Peter would do the same thing.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:32.580]   Back in Matthew 16, when Jesus said He was going to die, Peter said, "No, no, no, Lord.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.620]   That's not going to happen."
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:42.080]   And Jesus looked right at Peter and said, "Get behind Me, Satan."
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.700]   Satan put things in the mind of Judas.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.780]   Satan put things in the mind of Peter.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.940]   Judas was influenced by Satan.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.340]   Peter was influenced by Satan.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.580]   Now, let's pick up the story.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.580]   Let's go to Matthew 16.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.580]   Let's go to Matthew 16.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:07.220]   Let's look at the story of his betrayal in verse 69.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:16.260]   Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.480]   too were with Jesus the Galilean."
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.500]   Now, remember, this is the courtyard at the high priest's house where Jesus is on trial,
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.420]   and Jesus has been deemed a blasphemer.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.620]   "You too were with Jesus the Galilean."
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.840]   He denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:46.480]   And we gasp for breath, because Peter had just said, "Even though all may fall away
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.560]   because of you, I will never fall away.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.100]   Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you."
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.620]   So much for knowing his own heart.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.620]   "I will not deny you."
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:10.260]   When a little servant girl says, "Oh, you were with Jesus the Galilean," he denies it
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.120]   not only to her, but before everybody around the fire in the courtyard.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.740]   "I don't know what you're talking about."
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.180]   When he had gone out to the gateway, he relocates to get away.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:27.740]   Another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.780]   Nazareth."
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.500]   And again he denied it, this time with an oath.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.640]   "I do not know the man."
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:41.440]   A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.500]   them, for even the way you talk gives you away."
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:52.440]   You talk that sort of Galilean Jesus talk.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.960]   Then he escalates.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   He began.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.740]   First, he said, "No.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.740]   Then he said, "No," with an oath.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:11.020]   And now he says, "No," with a curse and swearing, "I do not know the man."
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.640]   And immediately a rooster crowed.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.740]   Sad account.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.580]   Sad account.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:33.020]   Peter actually pronounced a death curse on himself if he was lying.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:38.080]   He pronounced a death curse on himself if he was lying.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.340]   Did he kill himself?
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.820]   No.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.200]   Judas pronounced a death curse on himself and carried it out.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:53.280]   But there's an amazing moment in verse 75.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.580]   Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.900]   "Before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.820]   It doesn't say he went out and hanged himself.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.700]   It says he went out and wept bitterly.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.020]   Amazing moment.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:21.600]   Crushing sadness led Judas to suicide without repentance.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.580]   Crushing sadness led Peter to restoration with repentance.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:32.480]   This is the crucial moment.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.600]   Both knew they were betrayers.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.620]   One kills himself.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.120]   The other is restored.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.980]   How did Peter fall so far?
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.900]   Well, he boasted too much.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.900]   We know he prayed too little because he fell asleep.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.340]   We know he acted too fast.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.820]   He grabbed a sword.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.980]   And then we know he followed too far.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.300]   He was way out in the courtyard.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   Why was this not the end of Peter?
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.820]   What distinguishes Peter from Judas?
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.820]   What's going on here?
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.020]   I'll give you the simple answer.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.780]   This is where all of this goes.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:34.280]   Judas hated Jesus because he wanted something Jesus was not going to deliver to him.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:42.060]   He had false expectations of what Jesus intended to do for him.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:48.920]   When those expectations aren't met, people hate Jesus.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.660]   False preachers will give people lies about what Jesus did.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.800]   They will tell people what Jesus intended to do for them to fulfill their drives and
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.380]   ambitions.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:09.400]   When it turns out that doesn't happen, they will hate Jesus for it.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.540]   The difference was Peter didn't hate Jesus.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.640]   He loved Him.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.400]   Jesus says to him in John 21 three times.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.540]   You know the story.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:30.420]   Verse 15, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   More than these.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.380]   "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.780]   Second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.260]   "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.260]   Third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.980]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?"
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.280]   And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.700]   You know that I love You."
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.420]   And the Lord accepted that.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:26:02.620]   He accepted that as true because He said, "Feed My sheep, feed My lambs, feed My sheep."
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.320]   That is the deep and compelling reality of a true believer, love for Christ.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.260]   That's where we're going, right?
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.060]   That's what sets people apart.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:18.520]   Two followers, two disciples, two students, two preachers, indistinguishable even to their
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.380]   own close companions.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.300]   One a suicide and went to hell.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.380]   One a saint who's in heaven.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.060]   Both betrayed Jesus in very adamant public ways.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:39.580]   All the similarities did not lead to a common end.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:47.220]   They are forever separated by an impassable gulf.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.220]   Judas hated Jesus.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.220]   Peter loved Him.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.180]   Our Father, we thank You for the...
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.020]   the Scripture.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:27:05.300]   We thank You for its profound poignancy, its power.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:14.160]   We thank You that all You ask of us is not that we earn anything, but that we love You.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.500]   And we know we can't even do that.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:23.060]   If we do love You, we love You because You first loved us.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.060]   We love You and we love You.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.060]   We love You because You are the one who loved us.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.060]   We thank You for the love that You gave us.
