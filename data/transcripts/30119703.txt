[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.260]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.920]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.700]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.900]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.220]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.940]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.420]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.400]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.480]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.460]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.280]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.620]   But don't forget,
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.260]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.200]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.800]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you back
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.620]   to the podcast and I'm excited about this episode.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.100]   Mock trial is something that I loved for a lot of years.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.720]   I spent about seven years as a Challenge B tutor
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.920]   years ago, admittedly,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.040]   but I absolutely loved working on mock trial
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.540]   with my students, with my students who lived in my house
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.560]   and with the students that I tutored week by week.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   And there were lots of reasons that I loved it.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160]   And I know that some of you have loved it in the past
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.540]   and some of you are looking forward to loving it.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.320]   And some of you maybe are not as big a fan of mock trial
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.080]   as I am and as my guest is,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.280]   I'll introduce her in just a second.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280]   So I wanted to use this episode
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.720]   to kind of set your minds at ease
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.160]   if you're anxious about mock trial,
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.860]   cast a vision for what it can become
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.820]   if you are not sure why we do this in Challenge B
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.640]   and what the good of it is,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.520]   or if you're just not excited about it,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   I would like to cast a vision that might make you excited.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640]   And I have the perfect guest to do that.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.520]   Stephanie Meador is here with us today.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.320]   Stephanie, thanks for joining me.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.500]   - Thank you, I'm really excited.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.120]   I happen to know that Stephanie also loves mock trial.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.240]   Now, why would I invite somebody
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.040]   who did not love mock trial to talk about mock trial,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   but she has loved it as a student herself
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.080]   and as a tutor mentoring students
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.900]   through the 15 weeks of the mock trial process.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.300]   So she has got some great insights to offer us today.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.760]   And so I'm really glad that she's here.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.800]   Stephanie, I know that you spent,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.680]   have spent a good many years yourself
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.440]   as a Challenge B director
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.260]   and interacting with lots of communities at practicums
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.840]   and with parents who are thinking about joining your class
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.520]   and all of that.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.080]   Have you ever heard of families
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   considering skipping Challenge B?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.120]   You know, maybe their student is coming into CC late
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.000]   and they're a little more than the 13 year old age group,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.780]   12, 13 year old age group.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.100]   They could begin in Challenge 1.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.220]   They're just thinking about skipping Challenge B.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.700]   How would you advise them?
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.520]   - Well, I would never advise someone to skip Challenge B
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.740]   because I think it's super fun.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.960]   First of all, I just think it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.440]   And it's a great level for this age group.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.360]   I think it really meets students where they are
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.160]   in this transition phase between sort of the younger
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.640]   wanting to just memorize things
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.800]   and have things given to them phase,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.060]   as opposed to the arguing and taking things apart
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.440]   and putting them back together phase
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.880]   and communicating phase.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.120]   Challenge B is a really good example of a program
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.020]   that's kind of tailored to that.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.780]   It harnesses that energy and helps them learn
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.060]   to learn some discipline, channel that energy.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.400]   It's just a really good bridge for students to practice
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.600]   reading and writing skills on some easier literature
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.400]   and learn to tackle subjects that are unfamiliar.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.360]   I think about formal logic can be intimidating
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.000]   and unfamiliar and it's nice that they tackle that
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   before we have to start thinking about high school credits.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.680]   And students just build a lot of confidence, I think,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   through experiences like mock trial.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.640]   So I wouldn't recommend skipping B
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.240]   just because it's a lot of fun
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.380]   and a really good transitional bridge
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.360]   between that elementary school and high school.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.080]   - I love your metaphor of a bridge.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.880]   I agree with you completely.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.600]   I mean, let's face it, Challenge B students,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   especially when B starts in the late summer, early fall,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.640]   y'all, I love to Challenge B students,
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.900]   but they are still kind of goofy.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.720]   And they, I think it is, you're really right, Stephanie,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   it's a really lovely bridge that lets them be who they are
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.520]   and grow into who they're becoming.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.480]   That's really good wisdom there.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.720]   I also know, and partly I know this from speaking
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.240]   at practicums all over the country for so many years.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.880]   And so I feel like I have a kind of a,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.000]   I've taken the temperature of a lot of families
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.200]   who look at Challenge B and they worry.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   You mentioned unfamiliar subjects like formal logic.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.920]   So families tend to look at Challenge B
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   and they sometimes are a little worried about that
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.360]   'cause maybe mom, neither mom nor dad had formal logic,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.400]   but they're also a little put off,
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.880]   some of them, by the whole idea of mock trial.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.680]   They feel like it's gonna be too much for their kids,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.800]   for their eighth grader.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.360]   I've had families who have thought about doing Challenge B,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.360]   but skipping the mock trial seminar for various reasons.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.120]   Have you ever had this experience?
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.780]   And what would you tell a family
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.960]   that is just really worried about mock trial?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.040]   - Yeah, I think there are maybe a couple of reasons
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.900]   that families get nervous about mock trial.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.440]   And one of them is just that they're worried
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.400]   that it will be too much for their student work-wise.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.920]   And I mean, I understand that fear mock trial is a lot.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.960]   You're just given a bunch of case materials
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.840]   and told to do this thing that you've never done before.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.280]   But in terms of it just being a lot,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.540]   I think it's still appropriate for the age
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.780]   because of two things, time and teamwork.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.380]   So time, mock trial is a semester long process
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.120]   and it's broken into steps.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.200]   So it is a huge task, yeah,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.420]   but they have three months to do it.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.700]   So students are working on this for their whole semester
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.240]   and working on it little by little
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.800]   in steps that are broken down for them
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.440]   in the challenge guide and the mock trial notebook.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   And then the other T, the teamwork,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.640]   there are roles for every type of kid in mock trial.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.620]   I mean, if you're a performer kid, if you like to argue,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.660]   if you want to be a detective, you want to be a leader,
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.020]   but then also if you are quiet and you notice things
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.180]   and you want to support your friends' ideas
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.660]   and you want to do more behind the scenes things,
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.940]   there's something for you there as well.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.760]   And every class has kids that are like both of those parties
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.600]   and they learn to work together.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.080]   They learn to talk and listen.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.860]   They learn to see things from different perspectives.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.260]   They learn to win and lose gracefully,
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.500]   not just mock trial at the end,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.260]   but within their own little team
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.200]   as they are going through this process.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.340]   Sometimes their ideas will be the one that everybody adopts
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.100]   and sometimes it's not and they just learn about that.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.220]   At the end of the day, the time and the teamwork
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.440]   really makes this whole huge endeavor possible.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.780]   And then I would really hate for kids
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.540]   to miss out on that process because they all can do it.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.420]   And the fact that they get to the end of the semester
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.340]   and they have done it builds their confidence
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.420]   like nothing else.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.900]   - Man, you made so many good points.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.720]   I was jotting down notes furiously.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.620]   So much good wisdom in there.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   I absolutely love the time and teamwork, the double T there.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.480]   And that keeps it, you're right,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.720]   that does keep it from being too much.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.000]   Students are never left alone to figure it out.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.200]   I mean, they never are.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.720]   As homeschoolers and in classical conversations
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.000]   and on community day, nobody's ever left alone.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   But I love the way that you remind us that they tackle,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.960]   they eat this elephant one bite at a time.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.240]   They work in steps.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.400]   So then the steps are prescribed for them
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   so that they're not just thrown on their own
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.280]   and we assume that you will know how to break this down
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.820]   in the best possible way.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:42.120]   I really like what you said about not depriving our students
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.680]   of the beautiful lessons that they learn.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.040]   I never really thought about how much they learn
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   about winning and losing and teamwork during the semester.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.620]   I really like that.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.320]   They do learn to put forth an idea
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.340]   and sometimes have their idea adopted
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.760]   and learn how to react to that, respond to that.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.840]   And then sometimes have their idea not chosen
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.000]   and have to learn how to live with that gracefully.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.400]   That's lovely.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.260]   That's a great thing.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.600]   And so you have your experience
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.240]   and you've done this more than once or twice.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.580]   So your experience has been that by and large,
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.200]   it's not too much for an eighth grader to experience.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I've never had a student
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.320]   who couldn't participate in mock trial.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.580]   I've had students who given the choice
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.480]   would not have chosen to do this.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.840]   But at the end of the day, no one has ever,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.020]   I mean, and maybe this has happened in other communities,
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.880]   but no one's ever cried on the stand.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.500]   Like no one has ever not been able to do mock trial.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.740]   And part of that is just the director wants your student
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.800]   to have a good experience as well.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.720]   So he or she is not going to give your student a role
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.760]   that isn't a good fit.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.440]   So there really are roles for all different types of kids.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.220]   If you have a student who really needs to be fully scripted,
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.400]   there is a role for that.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.500]   You can read from a paper if that is where you're at
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.800]   at the end of the semester.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.180]   - Right.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.640]   - Yeah, so I've never had it actually be too much
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.480]   for a student.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.920]   And really every time, by the time it's over,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.580]   everyone is glad that they did it.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.520]   I've never had a student just all the way up
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.940]   into the very end, like they still hated it
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.580]   and still didn't wanna do it and it was terrible.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.140]   Everyone is always glad that they did it.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.020]   And they're impressed with themselves.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.980]   They feel really proud and they should.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.640]   - Yes, you are right.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   You know, and I will just mention this,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.360]   parents who are listening.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   I have had more parents who are afraid
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   that their child can't do it than I have had students
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.680]   who were afraid that they can't do it.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.500]   And part of that is, you know, the eighth grade mindset.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.640]   They still are pretty sure they can do everything
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   and they are real emboldened to try most anything.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.480]   Now you do have some students who, for whatever reason,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.400]   maybe don't like to speak in public
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.180]   or don't like to be put on the spot,
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.200]   don't like to have to think on their feet
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.280]   or various other issues.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.840]   But usually it's the parents who are thinking
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.640]   that just sounds like a lot.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.940]   That is a lot of pressure, that's a lot of thinking,
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.760]   that's a lot of new vocabulary,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.260]   that's a lot of skills I've never done.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.180]   I don't know if my child can do this.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.820]   I think it's just too much pressure.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.140]   And usually what we as parents mean
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.820]   is that I'm afraid of this and I'm not sure I can help well.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.740]   And I think this could go south really easily
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.860]   and I don't think I'm a good tour guide for that.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.140]   And so parents tend to worry.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.840]   I had more years that I was a B tutor than not.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.360]   I had parents who would come to me
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.900]   about middle of second semester and say,
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.500]   "I'm just not sure this is going well.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.460]   "I just don't know if my child is gonna be able to do this.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.760]   "I know what's expected.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.820]   "I just don't know how this is gonna work out."
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.320]   And I will say, "Well, this is not my first time through."
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.240]   And so I am assuring you that you're going to be
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.120]   very pleasantly surprised by the way
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.740]   that your child steps up to the plate.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.780]   And I have told parents, I bet you have too, Stephanie,
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.620]   for years that, okay, this Challenge B student
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.340]   who begins Challenge B in August
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.800]   is absolutely not the same student
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.960]   who is going to present at mock trial in April.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.260]   These are not the same people, would you agree?
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.820]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.840]   And also, I will say that every year,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.520]   mock trial looks very rough for a very long time.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.060]   - Oh, such a long time.
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.060]   - Every year.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.740]   Every year, I get into the last two or three weeks
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.580]   and I'm like, "You know what?
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.400]   "This might--"
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.940]   - This is gonna be the year.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.060]   - But it always does.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.780]   Always, it always does.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.900]   It's so rough for so long and it makes me nervous.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.240]   But I have at least learned to trust the Lord
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.820]   and then also to trust the process
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.100]   because really, really, by the time it actually happens,
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.780]   I am always impressed.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.160]   But yeah, the parents coming to you midway
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.740]   saying they don't think this is going well,
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.160]   I mean, the director's like,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.820]   "Yeah, I don't think it is either."
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.220]   - Yeah, it doesn't look pretty.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.060]   It doesn't look pretty.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.820]   - Right, the process is messy,
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.520]   but the outcome in the end is really always beautiful.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.860]   - And it is.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.320]   I will tell you, parents, that it is frankly amazing,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   even to those of us who have seen it time and again,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.740]   it is frankly amazing to get to the end
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.160]   and you look at your students
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.320]   and you're listening to them and you think,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.720]   "And where have these people been all year?"
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.320]   Well, where they have been is becoming.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   They have been becoming excellent thinkers.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.400]   They have been becoming awesome argument architects.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.060]   They have been becoming clear and persuasive presenters.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:45.180]   They have been becoming gracious teammates.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.060]   And it's beautiful to behold.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.860]   So I guess what Stephanie and I are saying is
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.860]   don't skip challenge B and don't skip mock trial.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.860]   We do understand that mock trial is very polarizing.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.100]   Some families really look forward to it.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.500]   Some students really look forward to it.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.260]   And some students really dread it.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.220]   Does this happen to you in most of your classes, Stephanie,
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.520]   that you have some that are for and some that are against?
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.600]   - Yes, yes.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.080]   Every once in a while you'll have a student
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.100]   who's just neutral.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.900]   But for the most part, it is in those two camps,
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.660]   the kids who are so excited.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.500]   - And who are they?
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.300]   Why are they so excited?
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.660]   - Yes, usually these are the loud kids.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.060]   The loud kids are excited and the quiet kids kind of dread it
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.900]   because they think there's nothing for them to do
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.380]   or nothing that they'll be comfortable doing.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.220]   But there is.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.340]   - Yes, yes.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.220]   - Yeah, and so it's the students who like to talk
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.120]   that are usually excited.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.420]   They go into this maybe already even thinking
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.020]   that they want to be lawyers.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.540]   These are the students whose parents probably feel
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.420]   the dialectic stage like a ton of bricks at home.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.940]   - My goodness, yes, yes.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.700]   - The kids, the students love to argue.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.620]   They love to collect evidence.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.420]   They love to challenge things just for fun.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.140]   They might be the students who write LTW papers
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.940]   with stances that the family does not even believe
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.780]   just to practice.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.620]   - Yes, yes, devil's advocate positions, yes.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.560]   - Yes, yes.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.940]   Then there's also students who are excited about Mock Trial
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.060]   because they are serious and they love to do big tasks
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.760]   and do them right and apply themselves.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.080]   These are the students who are detailed oriented.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.560]   They like to notice things, really iron things out.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.160]   So not always the argumentative students,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.720]   but sometimes just the students who like to see details
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.280]   and like to do things right.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.480]   - Yeah, or who like to work puzzles.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.360]   I've had kids, students who like puzzles who like Mock Trial
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.760]   because it's like putting together a puzzle.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.860]   And then the students who typically don't look forward
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.880]   to Mock Trial at first, they are those quiet ones
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.960]   who worry that they're too shy to do it,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.180]   or they've internalized a belief that they can't
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.360]   or that they're not smart enough,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.280]   which I think is so sad because that's not true.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.420]   And I'm sorry that if they would ever think that,
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.260]   because it's like with the guidance of the director
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.840]   and their parents, that doesn't need to be
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   the student's experience.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.240]   They are capable of doing Mock Trial
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.960]   and just we need to shepherd them and stick up for them
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.620]   and sometimes help classmates learn to listen to them
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.820]   because sometimes these students are quiet.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.440]   And I'll be honest, these are the students
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.860]   who will knock your socks off at the end.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.260]   It is quiet students, the ones who were nervous,
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.660]   who have the biggest transformation in the end,
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.820]   really every time.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.700]   - Wow.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.840]   That is such an encouraging thing for the parents
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.540]   on this call to hear, that your go get 'em,
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.020]   I wanna make a splash, students are gonna love Mock Trial.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.800]   You're quiet, I want to notice the details,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.300]   students are gonna love Mock Trial.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   But also you're retiring, I'm not sure I can do this.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:10.160]   Students can be led to see their strengths in this endeavor.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.840]   And like you have said before, it is very confidence
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.580]   building for all of those students.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.580]   You made a good point that all of our students have helpers
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:30.500]   that are going to help them find success
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.600]   as Mock Trial participators.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.160]   So they have parents who are, and we wanna talk about
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.360]   how each one of these really does help.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.520]   They have parents who are gonna be at home
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.240]   and parents who are gonna help you know what you can do
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.200]   to help your Mock Trial student,
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.980]   whatever kind of Mock Trial embracer they are.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.980]   They also have the guide which helps them break up
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:01.020]   the process of building the case into steps
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.060]   that are doable, that are easy to see.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.540]   And if you will follow all the steps,
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.900]   you will get to the end and have a hold.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.100]   There won't be things missing.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.740]   But you also have your director who is gonna guide you
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.980]   by asking you wonderful questions
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.440]   and not telling you what to think
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.480]   or even necessarily how to think,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.120]   but ask you questions that will show you
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.760]   what the next best step is.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.800]   But Stephanie, I want you to encourage
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   our parent listeners also that there are other parts
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.080]   of the Challenge B and other parts
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.520]   of the Classical Conversation curriculum
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.400]   that has come before this that are preparing these students
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   by showing them and sharpening their skills
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.000]   before they ever get to Mock Trial.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.720]   Can you speak to that?
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   In what ways do students, other studies
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.500]   help them prepare for Mock Trial thinking?
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.220]   - This is a question that I usually address
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.280]   in my Challenge B orientations
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.920]   because I really think that all of the strands go together
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.660]   and kind of get synthesized in Mock Trial.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.680]   So I'll just do broad strokes of what I see
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.120]   and all of the seminars helping,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.240]   but then three in particular.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.280]   So from Latin studies, students have been sharpening
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.100]   their attention to details and pattern recognition
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.480]   and even some vocabulary, the legal system
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.360]   and the medical system use a lot of Latin-based words.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.160]   So that's helpful from Latin.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.880]   With formal logic, students can draw a lot from,
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.240]   well, fallacies for sure,
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.160]   but also just general reasoning skills,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.200]   noticing that you have to build a case slowly
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.040]   with all the necessary pieces
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.320]   and guard against that correlation
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.260]   leading to causality kind of thing.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.440]   Just because something happened
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.080]   doesn't mean it caused something else
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.280]   and formal logic teaches them to notice that.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.360]   With literature, students have practiced
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.920]   persuasion techniques and evidence gathering
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.260]   and learning how to appeal to particular audiences.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.540]   With history of astronomy,
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.860]   students have worked on a timeline construction
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.200]   and seeing relationships and studying the scientific method,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.740]   which has some overlap in Mock Trial as well.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.240]   In their defeating Darwinism studies,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.680]   they learn a lot about expert testimony
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.760]   and again with some fallacies and how to use evidence.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.720]   And then with American Experience Storybook,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.320]   they have studied storytelling,
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.640]   seeing both sides of an issue,
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.680]   thinking about cause and effect,
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.000]   and then even math is more logical thinking,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.620]   following the orders of operation,
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.960]   which can be similar to court procedure
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.080]   and that idea of connecting the dots,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.260]   seeing how everything leads to something else necessarily
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.220]   by the way that a problem is constructed.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.560]   But in particular,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.260]   I know I just went through all of the strands,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.680]   but I really noticed exposition,
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.740]   the formal logic and the defeating Darwinism,
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.980]   which is the research strand.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.300]   So the formal logic sort of goes without saying
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.140]   what we've mentioned, the fallacies and the argumentation
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.540]   and defeating Darwinism,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.120]   learning about expert testimony and evidence.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.540]   But short story is one that I actually bring up
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.540]   pretty frequently, both first semester and second semester.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.540]   So in first semester, students are writing persuasive essays,
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.600]   and you need to learn how to gather proofs or evidence
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.160]   and then support each proof with some supporting facts.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.240]   And you even want to have an exhortium,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.600]   an opening to your presentation
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.340]   that catches people's attention.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.160]   You need to have a thesis statement.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.660]   You know, what is the overall argument
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.400]   that you're trying to convince?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   You need to think about refutation.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.400]   So what is the other side likely going to say
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.720]   and how will you refute that?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.340]   So really all of the things from "Lost Tools"
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.140]   comes into play with mock trial.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.220]   But then also at the end of the day,
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.340]   what you're doing with mock trial is telling a story.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.600]   And so we bring in some elements from short story
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.880]   with Frytox Pyramid.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.520]   What is the setting of your trial?
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.800]   Who are your characters?
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.900]   What is the conflict?
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.560]   Even what is the theme?
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.360]   We talked about theme and mock trial
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.320]   and trying to guide students to come up with something
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.200]   that is memorable and powerful as the theme for their trial
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.600]   that the jury can hear over and over
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.900]   and associate with your side of the story.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.420]   Yeah, I mean, really just you are telling a story
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.260]   the whole time.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.200]   So what perspective are you going to present to the jury?
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.520]   How are you going to make that compelling
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.000]   and provide enough context and support
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   that the jury thinks?
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.280]   I think you're right.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.080]   Gosh, that is so good.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.640]   Parents, you need to play that on repeat
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.160]   for your students, for your challenge B students,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.700]   because all of those things that they learn
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.480]   and they work on during challenge B
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.400]   are skills that are useful across the board.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.640]   That is the coolest thing about a classical education,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   the connections that exist between all of the things
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.240]   that we learn, all of the things that we study,
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.340]   all of the things that we talk about.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.780]   And you're absolutely right, Stephanie,
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.780]   the students who pick up on the truth
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:51.200]   that mock trial is about who tells the best version
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   of the story will convince the judge or jury,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.940]   if you had a jury, because the truth is you could tell
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.880]   the story a number of different ways.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.200]   There are lots of stories to be told within the framework
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.520]   of the case materials for every trial.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.520]   And it's the person who recognizes that there is likely
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.000]   a theme and if you can pull it out and keep putting it
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.560]   before the hearers, that will carry the day.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.560]   And recognizing that how you draw the characters
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.000]   will affect how sympathetic the hearer is
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.500]   to your character's cause.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.960]   I just think what you said is really, really good.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:47.080]   And parents, that will help you to ask good questions
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.840]   as your students begin to work on mock trial.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.560]   You can ask, even if you don't know anything
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.120]   about court proceedings or this mock trial case,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.920]   you can ask questions like, what is your character like?
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.040]   What are his positive qualities?
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.600]   What are the negative qualities?
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.360]   What qualities do you want to highlight?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.600]   How could you highlight those qualities?
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.520]   What qualities do you want to downplay?
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.080]   And all the things that Stephanie mentioned
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.900]   will really help your student.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.160]   And you can ask those questions about short story
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.880]   and about mock trial.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.960]   So that's really good.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.880]   That was one of the questions I was gonna ask you, Stephanie,
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.780]   is how much help does the curriculum offer parents
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.240]   who know nothing about trials and court proceedings?
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.480]   So we have said that making sure you understand
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.240]   how the skills practiced in all of the other strands
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.520]   will help your student prepare for mock trial, that's good.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.900]   But how does the curriculum help me as a parent who knows,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.280]   I know none of this vocabulary.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.240]   I don't know how to build the case.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.560]   I don't know anything about these procedures.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.780]   How much is the curriculum gonna help me as a parent?
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.480]   - Well, the curriculum offers enough.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.840]   You know, it's not going to prepare a student for the bar.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.480]   - Right, right.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.800]   - But students are given real direction
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.480]   as far as they need to be.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.600]   So the mock trial notebook and the challenge guide
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.440]   walk students through the vocabulary
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.920]   and some of the sentences that they need to know,
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.160]   just how to enter evidence,
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.480]   what the bailiff says at different times.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.520]   So the curriculum will give students all that they need.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   And also it's all that students are allowed to use.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.500]   So across the board, all the challenge B communities
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.120]   are only allowed to use the challenge guide
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.560]   and the mock trial notebook.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.240]   So there's not a student who's being wildly coached
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.160]   or brought in with all of this evidence
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   from online or something.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.040]   That's not even allowed.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.360]   There is an opportunity in the challenge guide
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.120]   for a lawyer to come and speak to your community,
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.280]   just to answer questions about court procedure
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.480]   or very general strategy.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.320]   You know, what may--
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.960]   - But not specifically about the case, right?
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.800]   - Right, right.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.640]   - So just general court protocol guidance.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.720]   - Sure, and like what makes a good cross examination
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.640]   question generally,
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.080]   and what makes a good direct examination question.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.000]   So the lawyers are never coaching students on this case.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.440]   They really probably don't need to know
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.640]   what the case is about at all.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.520]   But if students want to know just very general strokes
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.800]   about how to write a good question,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.820]   that's something that they can get
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.000]   from the guest speaker lawyer.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.520]   - That's really good.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.520]   Okay, so the curriculum, the mock trial notebook,
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.840]   and my child's director are enough
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   to help me help my child do this well.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.180]   - Yeah, that's all you need.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.840]   Yeah, and a lot of times-- - That is so good.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.780]   - There's just collaboration and community
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.620]   between the students,
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.760]   which I think is where they probably learn the most.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760]   - Yes, I was gonna ask you,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.240]   what do the students get from community day activities?
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.360]   And so you said they get confidence.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.460]   What else do they get, practice?
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.280]   - Yes, community day is where a lot
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.560]   of the collaboration happens.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.860]   So students may meet together outside of community,
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.000]   especially once the roles are assigned
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.300]   about halfway through the semester,
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.020]   but they should not have to meet outside of community
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.800]   very often, if at all.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.020]   So in challenge B, in person, in community,
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.300]   is where you break into your groups
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.620]   and talk about the witness statements,
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.340]   where you saw discrepancies,
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.460]   what you think might have happened,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.220]   what kinds of questions you want to ask.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.300]   So community day is when a lot of that collaboration happens
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.140]   and what you're collaborating on specifically
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.200]   is broken down by the challenge guide as well.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   So it will tell you the weeks that you are studying
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.180]   and rewriting witness statements
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.620]   or learning to write direct examination questions
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.200]   or cross-examination questions
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.800]   or learning about opening statements and closing arguments.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.700]   So the challenge B guide and the mock trial notebook
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.460]   tell you what to focus on.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.160]   And then in community, students do.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.080]   The director will usually give the students
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.560]   some guiding questions or a particular activity to do
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.000]   and then students work on that in community together.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.680]   - Gosh, that is so good.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.720]   It's making me feel excited about mock trial again
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.540]   and I don't really have the opportunity
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.060]   to work on a mock trial with students right now,
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.720]   but it's getting me excited again.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   And I suspect that there are lots of sighs of relief
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.880]   going through our listening audience right now.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.840]   Thinking, well, this does not sound so over the top.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.120]   This does not sound like something we can't do
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.080]   and enjoy as a family.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   And I really think that that was my aim for this podcast.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.480]   So I appreciate Stephanie,
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   you talking us through that so very well.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.180]   Parents, I want to encourage you.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.000]   We have spent the last several summers learning together
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   during practicums ever more about our tools of learning,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.020]   our classical tools, the five core habits
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.180]   and the five common topics and the five canons.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:25.180]   And so I want to remind you as parent lead learners
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:30.720]   who have worked to put these tools into practice
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.800]   in your homeschool, that these are still the tools
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.700]   that will help you and your student explore
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.160]   this new subject, this mock trial subject.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   So naming, naming all the participants in the trial
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:51.680]   and all the parts of the trial, the opening statement
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   and the cross exam and the direct exam
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.200]   and what does the bailiff do and all of that.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.720]   The attending to the details of the trial,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.480]   whether that means just reading it over and over
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.240]   until you notice a new detail every time,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.780]   that's really important.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.160]   Memorizing, what is it that your student needs to memorize?
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.760]   Are there pieces of the witness statement
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.320]   that need to be committed to memory?
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.240]   Are there procedures that you need to have memorized
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.800]   so that in the moment of nervousness during the trial,
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   you don't forget what to do?
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.520]   Are there ways that you can express yourself?
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.880]   Student, one of the most fun parts of mock trial
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.120]   for students is that they get to act out other characters.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.640]   Stephanie, have you had students
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.880]   that really love the acting out part?
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.040]   - Yes, yes.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.640]   I have had students that I now associate,
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.300]   well, I associate different roles
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.580]   with the particular students
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.680]   who just knocked it out of the park.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.520]   I love that.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.480]   - Yes, I love it.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.140]   And there are kids who just love
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.140]   to become their character and they find different ways
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.940]   of expressing traits or truths
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.280]   about their characters or situations.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.600]   All of those tools of learning, those classical tools,
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   parents, you can use those to help your student
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.640]   mind the depths of this mock trial project.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   I just think that it is such an opportunity
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.900]   for it all to come together.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.600]   For me, mock trial is the synthesis of all the skills
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.080]   the students have practiced so far.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.600]   How do you see that, Stephanie?
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.760]   - The synthesis of all of the strands?
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.460]   - Of all the skills, like all the skills.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.340]   Have you seen that come?
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.420]   Have you seen them synthesize all the skills
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.920]   that you as a tutor have worked on with them
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.760]   through the Challenge B year and channel them all
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.880]   as they work on this presentation?
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.420]   - Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.840]   All of the skills that we learned in the strands
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.920]   that I kind of had listed them earlier,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.720]   all of that comes into play big time.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.320]   And I think it's fun to watch.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.480]   Students realize that as well.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.400]   I'll tell them that they're going to see
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.200]   this big synthesis at orientation
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.100]   and they're not really thinking about that yet.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.260]   But at the end of the year,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.520]   when they actually get to feel it,
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.460]   I think it's very, very cool.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.060]   And I love to unpack with them
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.840]   after the trial has taken place.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.680]   What did you learn?
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.380]   What skills do you see being important?
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.920]   And I have a little document on my computer
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.820]   called Collective Mock Trial Wisdom.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.940]   And it's just kind of the students' takeaways
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.420]   from years and years about what they learned,
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.980]   what they wish they had known,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.240]   and how they saw all of their skills working together.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.520]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.000]   Collective wisdom.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.480]   And I salute you for having that
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.860]   after mock trial talk with your students
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.860]   so they can look back and recognize the strides they made
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.120]   and the connections that they made.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.480]   I think that's really, really good.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.520]   What, out of all your years of Tutoring Bee
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.160]   and shepherding these mock trial teams,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   what have you seen students gain from their participation?
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:35.420]   - I know I keep saying it, but really confidence.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.920]   The students are so, and just a healthy amount of pride
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.420]   in the work that they've done.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.140]   They get to the end of the semester
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.200]   and they know that it was a job well done.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.040]   And I also see that their friendships are deeper as well,
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.160]   because going through an experience like this,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.620]   sort of doing a big task that seemed scary at the beginning,
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.040]   builds relationships in a very deep way.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.560]   So students have seen each other struggle really hard
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.760]   and they've seen each other succeed
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.500]   and it knits their hearts together
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.920]   in a way that's really cool.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.760]   So confidence, but also deeper friendships, I think.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.720]   - That is lovely.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.200]   What a blessing.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.600]   And parents, what parent would not choose
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.280]   to have your child participate in an activity for 15 weeks
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   that was gonna teach them how to be a better friend,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.400]   who was going to imbue them with greater confidence?
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.960]   Because I will tell you, I agree 100%
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.980]   with what you said about confidence, Stephanie.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.980]   I have seen it absolutely change students
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.640]   to come out on the other side and recognize
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.200]   that they did this hard thing that in lots of ways
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.460]   was harder than they ever thought it would be.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.800]   And for some of them, they did a hard thing
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.440]   that they were scared to do,
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   or they were unsure of how it would turn out.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:12.360]   To come through that and to know that they did it
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.960]   and that they pushed through with their friends
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.480]   that together they did this great thing
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   builds confidence like absolutely nothing else
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.720]   that I have ever seen.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.880]   And it carries over, that confidence carries over
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.180]   to the next time they're faced with something
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:36.180]   they've never done before that other people think is hard.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.880]   They seem to have a resilience and a,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.320]   well, I did it once, I can do it again,
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.100]   attitude that is beautiful to behold.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:51.420]   All right, Stephanie, I want you to finish this sentence.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.840]   Mock, because the title of our podcast today
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.360]   was Mock Trial, What's the Big Deal?
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.480]   So I ask you to finish this sentence.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.000]   Mock trial is a big deal because?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.980]   - It's transformative, is what I would say.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.640]   - Ah, I love it.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   Mock trial is a big deal because it's transformative.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.140]   I would give you two thumbs up for that.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.180]   All right, parents, you have signed up
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.680]   for a transformative experience with your child.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.180]   So I suggest to you that not only will your child
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.160]   be transformed, but you can be transformed by mock trial
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.920]   and your experience with it as well.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.800]   Stephanie, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.840]   and your collective wisdom of the years
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.780]   about mock trial with us, I really appreciate it.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.760]   - You're welcome.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.580]   - Parents, if you have listened to this episode
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.620]   of the Everyday Educator and it has helped you in any way,
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.080]   pass it on, pass it on to a friend,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.760]   to a fellow challenge be-er or a family
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.080]   who's considering challenge B for next year.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.280]   And let me say, if you're enjoying listening
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.240]   to the Everyday Educator, you might enjoy
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.280]   our other classical conversations podcasts as well.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   If you're a mom looking for parenting tips
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.160]   or stories of encouragement, just fun, honest conversations
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.840]   about the ups and downs of motherhood,
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.280]   join Delice and Jenny on the podcast
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   Blessings and Motherhood.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.520]   And if you're interested in current events or politics
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.520]   or culture or classical education and how Christianity
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.160]   relates to all these topics, you're gonna wanna check out
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.200]   Refining Rhetoric with Robert Bortons.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.760]   Robert will guide listeners in using those 15 classical tools
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.400]   that we were just talking about to navigate current events
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.120]   and critical issues.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.480]   So if either of those sounds up your alley,
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.160]   you can listen to both of those shows
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   on your favorite streaming app or on their website
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:16.360]   at blessingsandmotherhood.com and refiningrhetoric.com.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:23.120]   As always, it has been a pleasure being with you guys today.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.320]   Stephanie, thanks for joining us.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.480]   And listeners, I'll see you next time.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.440]   (gentle music)
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.500]   you
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:43.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
