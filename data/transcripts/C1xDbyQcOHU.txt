[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Today we're going to learn about two preachers. That's right, two preachers. Two
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:16.200]   people who walked with Jesus 24/7 for three years, heard everything He said, saw
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.600]   every miracle He did, even were delegated the power to do miracles and sent out to
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:32.080]   preach concerning Him. One of them is in heaven, the other one is in hell.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.240]   They had life in common together and ended up as separated as anyone can
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.720]   possibly be forever. It's a fascinating story. Stay with us.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.000]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:19.400]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.320]   Now as we come to the 26th chapter of the book of Matthew, I want to introduce to you
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   two familiar men and maybe introduce them to you in a way that you haven't seen them
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.920]   in the past. It's a tale of two men in this chapter. While when you read Matthew 26 and
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   on into chapter 27, you are focused on the Lord Jesus Christ who dominates these chapters
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.920]   as He goes to the cross. These are the accounts of His arrest and mock trial. You can read
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.220]   exile, and scourging, and execution on the cross.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.460]   Because the light is so bright on Christ, because he's such a dominating figure, you
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.840]   can lose sight of a tale of two men that is going on at the very same time, and it's a
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.300]   very remarkable, remarkable tale.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.500]   It fascinates me that these two men are the secondary characters in this chapter, and
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.440]   there really are no others.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.620]   It's Jesus and these two men.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.220]   You know them very well.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.080]   They both had the most unique privilege and opportunity ever given to a human being, ever.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.760]   Never to be given to anyone before or since.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.200]   Both were personally called by Jesus to follow Him.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.960]   Both answered the call and followed Him.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:56.780]   They followed Him 24/7 for three years, every day, all day, and every night, all night virtually.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.420]   Both declared repeatedly to Him and to those around them their personal devotion to the
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.660]   Lord Jesus.
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.180]   Both were personally trained by Jesus for ministry.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.760]   Both were students of Jesus.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.480]   They were in that.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.080]   They were in that all day long classroom called discipleship.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   Both of them were being trained for ministry.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.360]   Both of them were taught by Jesus, the unparalleled teacher, the most profound teacher that ever
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.100]   walked on earth.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.000]   They were taught by Him in ways that they could understand that which was profound and
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.120]   known to the world.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.960]   They were taught by precept, proposition.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.360]   And they were taught by example to know the Word of God and to know the will of God and
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.940]   to know the truth concerning all things.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.000]   They were given a divine worldview.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.520]   They were taught how to respond to the truth of God and live it out obediently.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   Both men saw the miracles of Jesus every day throughout the duration of His ministry.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.600]   They saw His power over demons.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.060]   They saw His power over disease.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.700]   They saw His power over death.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.700]   They saw His power over nature.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.840]   They saw His intellectual power to deflect every assault on Him from His enemies that
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.940]   came verbally as they tried to catch Him in His words.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.640]   They saw the mastery that He had of the language.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.160]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.780]   They saw the wisdom that He had of the Word of God.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.560]   that Jesus had come to proclaim good news to sinners.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.120]   Both of them received and used divine power, power from Jesus and authority from Jesus
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.180]   was delegated to them so that both of them were enabled to do miracles and to exercise
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.820]   power and authority over demons.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.940]   Eventually, both of them were sent out to preach.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.900]   Both of them became preachers and they preached that the Messiah, Jesus, was the Savior and
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.500]   the Son of God and the King.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.820]   And they shared all the experiences together for those amazing three years.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.820]   They were exposed to the Lord Jesus Christ in exactly the same way, the same experiences
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.720]   in the same period of time.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.140]   There's more.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.240]   They both were sinners and they knew it.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.340]   They knew it well.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:46.480]   They both felt profound guilt about their sin, overwhelming guilt about their sin.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.040]   There's more.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.820]   They both were taken over by Satan.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.420]   Both of them.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:05.240]   To take up Satan's cause against the Lord Jesus.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:17.220]   And in the end, they both betrayed Him publicly, violently, strongly, openly, they betrayed
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.700]   Him.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.820]   And they did that at the end of that three years.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.860]   Just before He was crucified.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:37.660]   As a result of what they did, both were sad, sorry.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.760]   In fact, they agonized over their betrayals.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.720]   Both of them did.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:53.320]   One was so agonized that he killed himself.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.720]   The other was so agonized that he repented.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.780]   Two men whose lives were side by side in the presence of the Son of God.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:15.260]   One of them, in spite of his wicked betrayal of the Savior, is considered so honorable
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:22.080]   and so exalted a person that some of you are named after him.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.320]   In fact, people have been named after him.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.540]   People have been named after him since the first century.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.820]   And people will continue to be named after this betrayer.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.760]   He is loved.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.300]   His name is honored.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.500]   And his name is Peter.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.820]   The word doesn't mean anything particularly important.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.640]   It's the word for stone.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.320]   The other man is considered so dishonorable.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:01.300]   The other betrayer is so despicable that no one has his name.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.960]   You don't know anyone who has his name.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:10.720]   You don't know anyone's dog who has his name.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.020]   He is hated.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.620]   He is reviled.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.500]   He is rejected.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.060]   He is Judas.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.320]   And his name means praised.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   Such an elevated name for such.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:30.600]   A dishonorable man.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:41.580]   One of these men, we who belong to Christ, will meet because that betrayer is in heaven.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:53.320]   The other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.620]   The other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.620]   The other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.620]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.140]   The other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.

[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.620]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.620]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.620]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.

[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   And the other, you who reject Christ, may meet because he's in hell.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.040]   And they went out to the Mount of Olives.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.560]   They went out to the Mount of Olives.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.940]   Passover was done, they went there to pray.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.500]   And if you go down to verse 36, that's exactly what happened.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.820]   They came to Gethsemane, which means olive press.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.500]   He told the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.480]   He took with him Peter and James and John, began to be grieved and distressed, and you
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.320]   know he went there.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.020]   He went there to pray.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:32.360]   So the disciples are now in Gethsemane, Peter and John a little further in into the garden,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.640]   Jesus a little further in praying alone.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   And here we pick up the story of Judas after he left...after he left.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:53.320]   He goes out and negotiates his deal with the leaders of Israel for thirty pieces of silver.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:24:01.360]   He knows where they are in the familiar place in the garden on the Mount of Olives.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.320]   And so we pick up the story in verse 45.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.220]   "Then he came to the disciples and said to them, 'Are you still sleeping and resting?'"
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.200]   Remember they kept sleeping instead of praying.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.600]   "Behold, the hour is at hand.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.260]   The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.260]   Get up, let's be going.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.720]   Behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand."
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.320]   Judas has arrived.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.420]   And now we look at the man Judas.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.300]   Verse 47, "While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.460]   by a large crowd with swords and clubs who came from the chief priests and elders of
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.460]   the people."
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.280]   He's got a massive group of hundreds of people, including the temple police, the Roman soldiers,
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:48.840]   the leaders of Israel, all the elite religiosity purveyors of that apostate form of Judaism.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.320]   They're all there to arrest him in the night away from the crowds.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.500]   And Judas has given them a sign.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:03.880]   Verse 48, "He who was betraying Him gave them a sign saying, 'Whomever I kiss, he's the one
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.300]   sees Him.'"
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.260]   There's some profound anger in that.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.920]   There's some profound bitterness in that.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.420]   There's hatred in that.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:23.320]   Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kept on hearing.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.960]   Everyone kissed Him, kissed Him repeatedly.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.920]   And Jesus said to him, "Friend," and it's not the word for friend that is most used
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   to refer to that.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.440]   It's not the kind of friend that you think of as an intimate friend.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.600]   It's the word for associate or comrade.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.660]   It's a more indifferent word.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.460]   It's a more distant word.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:48.220]   Comrade or associate, do what you have come for.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.320]   Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:00.240]   It's really unbelievable what Judas has done.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.320]   Verse 57 says, "When they had seized Him, they led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest."
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.680]   They were gathered together in this phony trial with false accusations.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.220]   They tried to bribe witnesses to lie about Him.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:18.500]   Verse 59, "Trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus so they could have a reason
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   to put Him to death."
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.320]   They couldn't get people who could get their story together, though many people tried because
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.200]   they would be paid if they could.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.700]   Finally some people came along and said He was going to destroy the temple of God and
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.280]   rebuild it in three days, which He said at the beginning of His ministry.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:39.500]   And this mock trial went from the high priest to Herod to Pilate, and you know all the phases
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.820]   of that trial.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.320]   The final adjudication, the high priest, verse 65, tears his robes.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.480]   He's blasphemed.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.280]   What further need do we have of witnesses?
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.360]   You have now heard the blasphemy.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   What do you think?
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.320]   And here's the final verdict on Jesus.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   The final judgment.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   The final judgment is this: "The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, is the one who is
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.580]   He is the one who is the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.580]   greatest."
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.580]   And the final judgment is this: "He is the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.580]   greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest."
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   The final judgment is this: "He is the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.580]   greatest, the greatest, the greatest."
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.580]   The final judgment is this: "He is the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest."
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.580]   The final judgment is this: "He is the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.580]   He is the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the greatest, the
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.580]   greatest."
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.580]   That's the outcome for Jesus of His betrayal.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:26.020]   If you'd like to know more about other apostles who truly love the Lord Jesus Christ from
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.960]   their heart, get John's book, Twelve Ordinary Men.

[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.580]   Two men…
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:50.220]   Side by side for three years experiencing exactly the same thing in the presence of
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:58.660]   the glorious Son of God, together ended up as separated as two human beings can be, one
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.820]   in heaven and one in hell.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:08.580]   Judas, for whom Jesus was a disappointment, whom He resented if not hated.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.580]   Peter, for whom Jesus was a Savior whom He loved.
