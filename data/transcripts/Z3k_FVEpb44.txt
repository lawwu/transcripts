[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   A podcast listener named Nicole writes in to ask this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.320]   how do I confront a dear friend who is in Christ when I see her getting involved with a married man?
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:23.520]   I have already confronted her once before telling her to flee from adultery. I'm afraid she is in deeper now than before.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.600]   What scripture can I be pointed to to prepare for a very hard conversation with her?"
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   I think when we're trying to persuade someone who is in the sway of deception and sin,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   we need to combine two kinds of scriptures at least.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   One is the kind that very seriously and soberly and maybe even frighteningly warns against the folly of sinful behavior.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   And the other is the kind of scriptures that give hope, that a person, if they hold fast to Jesus and turn from evil,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   he'll give them a better future than they think they're going to have through sin.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   So those are the two kinds of scripture that I would put together, probably in that order.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600]   I don't know. The Holy Spirit can lead in that regard.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   And then there are simple practical insights that the Lord may bring to mind that don't come from any particular scripture.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   And I'll mention one of those in just a minute.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   So here's a few texts from both of those categories that you could speak to her about.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   "She probably thinks that she loves him, but she is about to destroy him," according to the Bible.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   And pointing that out might help.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   Proverbs 7, 21, "With much seductive speech she persuades him. With her smooth talk she compels him.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   All at once he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter or as a stag is caught fast till an arrow pierces its liver.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   As a bird rushes into a snare, he does not know that it will cost him his life."
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   This is what she's doing to him. And she needs to think about that if she thinks she loves him.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   Or Proverbs 6, 32, "He who commits adultery lacks sense. He who does it destroys himself."
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   That's aiding and abetting on her part.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Or Proverbs 9, 17, "Stolen water is sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   But he does not know that the dead are there and her guests are in the depths of Sheol."
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   Those are pretty serious words that she is drawing him into.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   She's about to cause him to commit adultery, even if they don't have sex, until he gets a divorce and marries her.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Because Jesus said in Luke 16, 18, "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery."
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   That's what she's drawing him into.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   Hebrews 13, 4 points out that she will be desecrating the marriage bed, his marriage bed, between a man and his wife, his wife and him.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   And the Bible says, "Hold them in honor. Don't desecrate them."
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   So that verse says, "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   For God will judge the sexually immoral and the adulterous."
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   So she's defiling the marriage bed that God says, "Keep in honor."
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   She'll be assaulting the image of Christ and his church as she pursues this relationship.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   She would be walking up to a portrait on the wall of the union of Christ and his church and slashing it with a knife.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   The picture is Ephesians 5, 31, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   This mystery is profound, and I'm saying it refers to Christ and the church.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   So she's slashing this mystery by saying Christ and the church really don't have to be committed to each other.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   She needs to know that she's not acting in freedom.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   She's acting in lockstep with the prince of the power of the air.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   He has a hook in her nose, and he is leading her by her passions.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   That's the picture in Ephesians 2.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   We are—unbelievers are following—people who sin are following the course of this world,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and so on.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   So the prince of the power of the air and the passions of our heart are in sync with each other,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   and any time we let our passions lead us into sin, we're not acting in freedom.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   We are in lockstep with the devil.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   And in all of this, she needs to realize that there's a deep problem in her heart,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   because Jesus said in Matthew 15, 19, "Out of the heart come adulteries."
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   And so the deep issue here, something has gone wrong in her heart,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   and therefore she needs to be warned if she goes on in this unrepentant way, she will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   She and the man are like teenagers having sex in a boat that is just about to go over Niagara Falls,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   and it feels so good, they can't hear the roar of the water.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   So you, her friend, are like a person on the shore shouting, "Watch out! Watch out! The falls! The falls!"
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   And then you'll do that with 1 Corinthians 6, 9, "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   Don't be deceived. Neither sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers will enter the kingdom of God."
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   So that's a cluster of texts that are on the warning side of Scripture
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   that often is used by God to awaken people from their folly.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   But there are Scriptures that she's going to need to hear, because they may be pretty enmeshed, that there's hope.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   God is a God of forgiveness. He's a God of patience.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   And mainly she needs to hear that God is on the side of her best happiness.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   She probably believes right now this is her best bet for happiness.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   That's not true. God is her only hope for happiness, and she's about to choose against him.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Psalm 16, 11, "You make known to me the path of life," and she's choosing against it.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   "In your presence, God, there is fullness of joy. At your right hand are pleasures forevermore."
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   That's what she's about to sacrifice. Or Jeremiah 29, 11, "I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   Plans for welfare, not for evil. You need to look right in the eye and say, "God has a better plan."
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   He really does. You can't see it, but he really does.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   And I mentioned a minute ago, I suppose, that there are these sometimes practical insights that aren't rooted in a particular text.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   Here's one. Does she see that if this man is the kind of man who will be unfaithful to his wife
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   and break his sacred promises to be faithful till death do us part,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   there is every reason to believe he will do the same thing to this woman.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   When their relationship hits hard times and another more attractive person comes along,
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   does she want a man to say to her, "For better or for worse, I'm yours till death do us part."
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   If she wants that, she's got the wrong man.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   But if she will hold fast to Christ, he does. He has a better future for her.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   Yes, amen. He does. Strong words, but loving words. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening in.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   Tomorrow we talk about what does it mean to receive Jesus into our lives.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   It's a key question, and we need to think about it very carefully.
