[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.360]   that portion of scripture that we read at the beginning in the Gospel according to St.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.760]   John, in chapter 5, directing particular attention to verses 6 to 9.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.400]   In the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, "When Jesus saw him lie and knew
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.840]   that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.960]   The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no men when the water is troubled to put me
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.120]   into the pool; but while I am coming another steppeth down before me.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.160]   Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.160]   And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked; and on the same
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.640]   day was the sabbath."
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.360]   In other words, I want to call your attention to the account which is given in this chapter
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.760]   of the healing of that lame and impotent man at the pool of Bethesda.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.640]   This is one of the miracles worked and performed by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.760]   I use my terms advisedly.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.160]   It was a miracle.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.760]   The Lord Jesus Christ did work miracles, and they are recorded here in the scriptures.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.360]   This is just one of them.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.120]   There is no difficulty about that.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.160]   Any man who finds any difficulty in believing in the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.300]   really in difficulty because he does not believe in God, and in the divine and the supernatural.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.320]   These things all go together.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.680]   Now the question that arises in our minds is this.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.000]   Why did our Lord work these miracles?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.480]   And why have the accounts of these miracles been recorded for us?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.800]   Now the answer to that question is given here in this particular miracle, as it is given
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.880]   in the accounts of all the miracles as they are recorded in this gospel according to Saint
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.320]   John.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.120]   John refers to them always as signs, and that gives us the key to the understanding as to
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.160]   why they were ever performed and as to why the account of them is preserved for us.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.680]   Primarily the business of these miracles which were worked by the Lord Jesus Christ was to
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   attest his person.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.520]   He did not do them merely because of his kindness and his compassion and his heart of love.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.880]   His first and his primary object was to give a sign as to who he was.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.000]   You will find later on in this same gospel of John that he turned to some skeptical and
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   unbelieving people on one occasion and said, "Though you don't believe my words, believe
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   the works.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.280]   Look at the things I've been doing."
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.040]   The miracles were worked primarily in order that it might be plain and manifest that he
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.280]   is what he claims to be, the only begotten Son of God who has come down from heaven to
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280]   earth.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.040]   You remember what he said in reply to the two messengers sent to him by John the Baptist
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.360]   with the question, "Are thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.400]   Go back," he said, "and tell John again the things which he do see and hear.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.840]   The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.000]   made to hear, the very dead are raised, and the gospel is preached unto the poor."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.840]   That's the answer.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.440]   These were the signs that the prophets prophesied I would show when I came.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.000]   I have come and I'm giving the signs.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.600]   Go back and tell John to look at them and to consider it again.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.400]   "Blessed," he said, "is every man that is not offended in me."
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.000]   Very well, there is the first thing.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.920]   And of course it's all important because the gospel of Jesus Christ eventually depends
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   entirely upon this as to who he is.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.160]   If he is not the Son of God, we have no gospel.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.000]   But if he is, and because he is, we have a gospel, a great and a glorious gospel of salvation
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   and of redemption.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.120]   Very well, there is the first purpose of miracles, but it has a second purpose.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:02.880]   Let us observe a second object, and that is to illustrate his spiritual work.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.320]   Now this is again not my theory, but something that is taught very plainly in the scriptures
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   themselves.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.680]   Our Lord worked these miracles in order that people might see that what he was doing there
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.920]   obviously and openly in a physical sense, he could also do and had come to do in a much
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.960]   greater sense, in a spiritual sense.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Now he says that in this very connection, in a very interesting manner.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   I read it to you as one of the verses at the beginning.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.920]   In verse 20 we read this, "For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:44.520]   that himself doeth; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel."
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.960]   He says, "I am going to do greater things than these miracles."
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.680]   And there he is referring to the more spiritual things.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.880]   So I say that the second object is to show that what he does in the physical is but a
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:10.200]   picture of the still yet greater thing that he can do in the realm of the spiritual, so
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.800]   that we can always regard these miracles, over and above being facts of history, as
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   being parables which preach to us and present to us the gospel of salvation.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   They are indeed wonderful illustrations of what our Lord Jesus Christ came into this
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   world to do for our souls.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   What he does there physically, he can do spiritually.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:46.560]   There is a perfect comparison between physical disease and the disease of the soul.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.840]   Indeed there is a very intimate connection between the two.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   You notice that our Lord suggested to this man that all his troubles, as I am going to
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.360]   emphasize, were due to his sin.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.200]   He said to him, "Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.600]   thee or come upon thee."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.520]   Sin leads even to physical diseases.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   There would have never been any disease in the world at all were it not that sin came
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.760]   in.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.360]   It is the ultimate cause of all our troubles.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.640]   Very well then, I say, as we come to look at this story, this incident tonight, the
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.400]   working of this miracle on the men at the Pool of Bethesda, let us see in it, by the
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:41.560]   grace of God, a wonderful picture and representation of this wondrous and glorious gospel of salvation.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.480]   You know, there is something even about this service tonight, or any such service at any
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:56.320]   time, which seems to me to be a very perfect reproduction of the picture that we are given
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.040]   in this very chapter.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.200]   There, you see, we have got a picture.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.560]   Our Lord was there in Jerusalem, and we are told that in the sheep market there was a
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.160]   pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:19.680]   And in these porches lay a great multitude of impotent folk, blind, halt, withered, waiting
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   for what?
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.920]   Waiting for a chance, a possibility of being healed when the water in the pool was disturbed.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.200]   There was a tradition—it was probably true—that the first who went into the pool at that point
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   was healed.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.440]   And there they had come, and there was a great crowd of them, and they had built porches
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   for them, gathering around the pool, hoping that perchance they might find healing.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.080]   And suddenly on this occasion, as they are there, sitting, lying, some of them, in their
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:58.020]   utter helplessness, waiting, the Lord Jesus Christ comes.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.800]   And he speaks to this particular man.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   And you remember what happened.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.640]   The man was made whole, he was healed.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   He was cured.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.120]   The Lord speaks to his soul.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.640]   And the whole story of this man from that moment forward is entirely different and is
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.400]   entirely new.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.200]   Now I say that if we could but realize it, what we are doing here tonight is something
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.760]   similar.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.000]   We have come together, and we have done so for some reason.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.840]   We are all aware of some need.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.600]   We are in a world of tragedy.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.760]   We are in a world of suffering, in a world of pain, in a world of shame.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   And we have come together to this place.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:49.320]   Do you know, my friend, and you realize this, that the same possibility is here tonight
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.200]   as was present on that occasion at that pool of Bethesda?
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.680]   We have the promise of this same Lord Jesus Christ, where two or three are gathered together
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.840]   in my name, there am I in the midst.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.800]   What a romantic thing it is to meet in a church.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.240]   What marvelous possibilities there are.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.080]   What surprising possibilities there are, even here at this moment.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.880]   Here are we.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.640]   We have come in our need, and he is here.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.800]   This poor man of whom we are reading and with whom we are dealing, and probably being carried
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.560]   there as we are told, day after day, many long years.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.760]   He had been ill thirty-eight years, and I have no doubt that he was put there on the
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.960]   floor on this occasion, oh, just feeling that it was just another day like every other day.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.240]   He expected nothing, but he received everything.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.600]   Now I say that is the marvelous thing about meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.800]   in the Christian church.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.600]   You see, because he is there, everything is possible.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.640]   The last thing you would expect may happen, the divine, the miraculous, the supernatural.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.200]   My dear friend, I would ask you a simple question at this point.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.240]   Do you realize the possibilities of this service?
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:28.400]   Because though unseen, he is here amongst us, and his touch hath still its ancient power.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.840]   What a romantic, what a marvelous, what a surprising thing it is to meet together in
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.600]   this way when the Lord Jesus Christ is present.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.160]   May I ask yet another question?
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.880]   Have you experienced this romance?
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.480]   Have you known what it is suddenly to be visited by the Son of God, who speaks to you and addresses
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.360]   you, and who solves your problem for you and puts you on your feet?
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.880]   Have you experienced it?
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.920]   Did you know it was possible?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.200]   Had you an understanding of these things?
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.960]   Are there any laws concerning these matters?
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.800]   Why shouldn't it happen to you this evening?
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.000]   How does it happen?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.080]   How does he act?
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.800]   What is the whole position?
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:26.040]   Well, let us look at this together simply tonight in order that we may see some of the
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:32.480]   principles which are taught here concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and the great and the
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.800]   glorious salvation that he came to bring to men and women in this sad and wretched world.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   Now, the matter divides itself up quite simply.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.240]   I am really trying to make nothing but a kind of running commentary this evening.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.960]   The first thing we look at, of course, is the man himself.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   The man.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.720]   Here he is, and you remember the facts about him.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:06.480]   A certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   Jesus saw him lying.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.040]   Lying, of course, because he was helpless and impotent.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.560]   Now, what do we know about this man?
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.280]   Well, the first thing we have got to emphasize about him is that all his troubles were due
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.440]   to sin.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.240]   This fourteenth verse is very important.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.480]   "Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art made whole;
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:41.440]   sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee."
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.360]   The thing that has come upon you is bad enough, and that was the result of your sin.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.320]   Sin no more, lest something worse come upon you.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:56.080]   Now, I am simply taking that out as a principle in this way.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.520]   All this man's troubles were the result of his sin.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:11.920]   Now, that is the fundamental proposition of the Bible, which we can never repeat too frequently.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.720]   All the ills and the troubles and the problems and perplexities and heartaches of this world
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   of ours are all the result of sin, every one of them.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.920]   "Oh, but that is exaggerating."
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.720]   It is not exaggerating.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.880]   When God made this world, he made it perfect.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.000]   It was paradise.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.800]   There were no problems there, none whatsoever.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.400]   There was no misery, there was no unhappiness, there was no jealousy or envy, there was no
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:47.480]   heartache, there was no wretchedness, there was no death.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:15:00.600]   All our troubles, every one of them, is the result of sin, of man's alienation from God,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:08.560]   of man's rebellion against God, of man's willfulness, of man's unutterable folly in
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:15.520]   asserting his own mind and will and understanding against God and his holy ways.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.400]   My dear friend, if you don't believe that, there is a sense in which all I'm going to
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.240]   say will be meaningless to you.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.040]   That is the first statement of the Bible.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.640]   We've got to understand the cause of our troubles, and they're that.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.280]   It isn't that evolution hasn't gone on long enough yet.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.760]   It is that man was perfect and fell.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.920]   It isn't that he was created imperfect and is struggling towards perfection.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.400]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.440]   The world is as it is because of sin.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   And what does it lead to?
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   Well, isn't it obvious here?
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.560]   Let me just pick out three things.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.440]   Sin always leads to misery.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.920]   It's obvious in the case of this poor fellow, isn't it?
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:14.240]   What a miserable state he was in, impotent, helpless, and had been like that for thirty-eight
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.440]   years.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.360]   Not only that, he had to suffer a good deal from the selfishness of others round and about
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   him.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.720]   You remember what he says, "When our Lord asked him if he'd like to be healed, the man
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.600]   said to him, 'Sir, I have no men when the water is troubled to put me into the pool,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.'"
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.920]   They were all out for themselves.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.880]   Maybe men wanted to get first into that pool, and nobody cared very much about anybody else.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.960]   The condition of these people varied a great deal.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.320]   Some were worse than others.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.920]   Some could still walk, but were perhaps lame.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.320]   Others could drag themselves.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.240]   Others could crawl, as it were.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.200]   But this man seems to have been about the worst of them all.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.280]   And he says, "Many a time have I made an effort to get there, but I never could.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.880]   I haven't anybody to help me."
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.440]   Some of these other people are wealthy people.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.040]   They've got servants they can bring along, and they put them in first.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   I'm always pushed back.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:22.320]   Everybody's out for himself, and there he is in his misery, paralyzed and impotent,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.360]   suffering remorse and shame, pain perhaps, realizing his paralysis.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.320]   But on top of it all, this bitterness coming in as he sees that every man's out for himself.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.660]   No one had any consideration for him.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.120]   No one ever said, "Ah, I'll stand back this time.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.960]   Let this poor fellow, he's been here thirty-eight years, let him have a chance."
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   Never a word.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   Every man for himself.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   "The heart knoweth his own bitterness," says the Old Testament, and it does.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:03.160]   But alas, in this sinful world, it's increased and aggravated by everybody else.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.360]   And we're all the same.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.880]   We're all guilty of it.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.760]   As the apostle Paul taught Titus, we were all once like that, hateful and hating one
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.920]   another.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.040]   Every man for himself.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.120]   And the result is the misery of the world.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.000]   Just think of all the most miserable cases you know in the world this evening and analyze
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.320]   them, and you'll find it always comes to that.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.800]   Those two factors are nearly always there.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.720]   And oh, the misery that is caused in the hearts of men and women tonight, simply because of
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   this selfishness.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:46.400]   Sin and selfishness, they go together, and they lead to untold misery and unhappiness.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.840]   Let me hurry to the second thing, that is, he was not only miserable, he was helpless.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   He couldn't move.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.000]   He had to be carried.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.080]   He tried to drag himself along the floor, but he couldn't get there in time.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.800]   I needn't stay with this.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.520]   The utter helplessness of these men is surely obvious.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.240]   And don't we all know something about this helplessness?
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   Have you ever really tried to give up a sin?
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.760]   Have you tried reforming your life?
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   Of course we have.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   We've all done it.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   We've taken our resolutions.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   We've made our pledges.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.760]   We are so ashamed when we fall, we shall never do it again.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.440]   But you've done it again.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.880]   We've all done it again.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   We are weak.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.360]   We are helpless.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.920]   We can't live up to our own standards.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.720]   We can't keep our own resolves and resolutions.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.960]   We can't keep the Ten Commandments.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.000]   We can't live the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.560]   We cannot please God.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.320]   Try as we will.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.800]   Try with all your might, and the more you'll try, the more you'll discover your own impotence.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   And that utter helplessness.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:04.880]   The trouble with the people who think they succeed is that their standard is so low,
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.360]   it isn't God's standard.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.760]   It isn't even a decent human standard.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.360]   The one thing to say about a person who says, "Well, I really am satisfied.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.680]   I don't feel that I'm a sinner.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.280]   I don't feel I'm a failure."
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:22.160]   The answer is, the standard is so low that it's not worth attaining unto.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.920]   When you read the lives of the saints, when you look at these great characters in the
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.800]   Scripture, when you look at the Son of God, do you still feel you've got strength and
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.000]   power?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.360]   You feel that there is still some potency and vigor and dynamic in you, in a moral sense?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:49.200]   Is there anything more awful and more miserable in life than to feel this sense of helplessness,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.760]   constantly falling to the same sin, constantly failing to be what we'd like to be, even
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   in a natural sense?
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.320]   Helplessness.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.520]   And then hopelessness.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.360]   It's here, obviously, in the case of this man, isn't it?
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.000]   This is a very perfect picture of hopelessness.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.320]   The very words that the man used in speaking to our Lord, he seems to say, "How can I?
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.560]   I've got no men.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.560]   I haven't got the money.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   I haven't got the means.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.800]   And everybody else is there before me.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   How can I?
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.000]   What's the use of asking?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.440]   Somebody else always gets in first."
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.520]   Complete hopelessness.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:40.280]   And I suppose there is nothing more sad and affecting in the condition of mankind this
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:48.000]   evening than the manifestation of this self-same sense of hopelessness.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.360]   You can see it on all heavens.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.640]   People manifest their sense of hopelessness by the things they clutch at.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.160]   They'll clutch at any cult, at any teaching.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.480]   They'll believe almost anything they read in a newspaper.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   Why?
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.480]   Well, they're hopeless.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.800]   They've tried so many things and they lead to nothing.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.400]   And then somebody says, "Have you tried this?" and they'll go after it.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.520]   They go the round of all these things, the cults and spiritism and so on.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.640]   I've come across some tragic cases of this comparatively recently outside the life of
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.000]   this church.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.520]   I can think of nothing more pathetic than that, than people who are disappointed and
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.680]   unhappy in life, who've lost a loved one or something like that, clutch at something like
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.840]   spiritism in some hope of being able to find a little comfort.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.720]   That shows you the sense of desperation, of utter hopelessness, that men and women have
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.680]   to try and live and eke out an existence in some such way as that.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:56.160]   The things they believe—astrology and all these things—I'm not here to condemn them.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.280]   I say that there is nothing more pathetic than this.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.120]   It just shows the desperate condition of people.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.440]   That's why they'd gathered round the pool of Bethesda.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.180]   The story had gone around that if you did manage to get in first, you'd be healed.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.180]   They came from everywhere.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:14.840]   They'll clutch at any straw, anything that offers a hope.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.180]   And that is why every latest teaching always has its followers.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.080]   These poor people are always looking out for something.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.080]   There is despair.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   There is utter hopelessness.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:33.400]   But let me apply it in a spiritual sense.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.460]   Have you realized, my dear friend, that you can never save yourself?
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.600]   You know, you've got to feel this hopelessness before you'll ever be a Christian.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.500]   As long as a man relies upon himself and his own powers, I have no gospel for him except
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   to tell him that he's a fool and that he's doomed to failure.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:02.540]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is for those who've become hopeless about themselves, who have
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.780]   passed through, in some shape or form, the experience that the Apostle Paul describes.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:13.580]   "To will is present with me, but how to perform I know not.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:19.380]   For the evil that I would not, that I do, and the good that I would, I do not.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.740]   With my mind I wespire after certain things.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:28.740]   I find another law in my members, dragging me down, paralyzing me.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.260]   O wretched men that I am!
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.660]   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.980]   Have you ever felt that?
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.540]   Have you ever known your own hopelessness?
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.740]   I say it's one of the great essentials.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.900]   Face yourself and face your own life.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.940]   Analyze it.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   I'm putting it in terms of what you know you should be and what you're trying to be.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:58.060]   See the hopelessness and then consider God's demands and God's law, and you'll realize
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.780]   that you'll never get there, and you'll be ready to say with Augustus, "Stop, lady.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:09.260]   Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws, demands.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:15.100]   Could my zeal, no respite, no, could my tears forever flow.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.660]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.660]   I'm hopeless."
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:27.780]   Well, there is the picture that we are given of the man.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.780]   Let me hurry now to look at the Lord who came to the man.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.460]   A certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:45.220]   When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he sat
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   unto him.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220]   Let's have a look at him.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:54.780]   This Jesus who came, the Lord.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:01.580]   I am simply confining myself this evening to what we are told here about him.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:09.940]   The first thing is that he came into the midst of this scene of desolation and despair.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:26.220]   All I want to emphasize tonight is this, he came uninvited, unasked, unsolicited.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.780]   No deputation had waited upon him to ask him to come there.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.180]   Nobody had sent a message.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.220]   Nobody had offered a plea.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.780]   Nobody had said a word to him.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.940]   He came in and of himself.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.900]   He decided to go there.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   He came.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.860]   Hold on to that.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.780]   Let me expound it in a moment.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:55.660]   And then the next thing I'm told is this, that he saw, oh hold on to these words, when
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.460]   Jesus saw him.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.740]   Nobody else saw him, you see.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.940]   They were all so anxious to get in themselves.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.580]   He was almost prodden upon, kept back by the crowd.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.980]   Everybody looked at him.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:13.180]   Everybody looked at himself, but Jesus saw him.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.940]   He looked at him.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.340]   He saw his condition.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.540]   And then we are told that he knew that he had been now a long time in that case.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.700]   He knew all about the 38 yards.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.620]   He not only knew about that, he knew that the man's trouble was originally due to his
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.540]   sin, that his physical troubles even were due to his sin.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:45.460]   And yet the whole point of this message, as I understand it, is just to say this, that
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:52.540]   though the Lord knew all this about him, he nevertheless came to him, and he spoke to
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.340]   him, and he healed him.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.620]   He made him whole.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.620]   He delivered him.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.620]   What does it all mean, says someone?
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:08.980]   Well, my dear friend, all this being interpreted just means this, that there we've got in
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:18.500]   a pictorial form the whole message of the coming of the Son of God into this world.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.140]   That's what this gospel is about.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.380]   That's what the other gospels are about.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.100]   That is the Christian message.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:32.500]   It is to say this, that into this world of ours the very Son of God has come.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:37.700]   One about whom I'm preaching is not a man like other men, is not in a series with philosophers
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.300]   or teachers or social gospelers or anybody else.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   No, no.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.380]   We start by saying this is the Son of God.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.180]   In the beginning, says John, at the beginning of his gospel, was the Word, and the Word
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:54.780]   was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:01.740]   This is the one who came to the pool of Bethesda.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.140]   And you see what it is I'm anxious to emphasize this evening?
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.740]   Why did he come?
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.140]   And you know there's only one answer to that question.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.700]   He came of his own free will.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:24.940]   He came unasked, he came uninvited, he came unsolicited.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.540]   Why did the incarnation take place?
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:35.260]   I say it was nothing from man's side, it was entirely from the side of God.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:40.540]   John has already reminded us of this in the words of our Lord himself, "God so loved the
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:46.660]   world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.780]   It is God who sent him, it is the Son who came.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.940]   No petition from men, no request, no desire.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.420]   God's action, God's initiative.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.980]   As Christ went and decided to go to the pool of Bethesda, so he decided to come into the
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.980]   world.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.940]   He left the courts of heaven, his eternal home and all its glory.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.820]   He descended, he came down, he entered into the Virgin's womb.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:17.620]   He came unsolicited, uninvited.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.460]   Why did he do it?
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.100]   And the answer is because of what he saw.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.380]   You know it's all there in the third chapter of Genesis.
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.660]   Adam and Eve sinned against God, and at once they began to feel miserable and unhappy and
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:43.980]   went to hide themselves, and what are we told, that God came down into the garden to them.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   Why?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:51.700]   Well because he saw them, and saw what they brought upon themselves, and saw the misery
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.220]   and the wretchedness.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.980]   Why did God send his Son into the world?
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.900]   Why did the Son come?
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:05.660]   I say there's only one answer, because they saw mankind in its misery, in its shame, in
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:12.340]   its helplessness, in its utter hopelessness, saw it struggling vainly in its civilizations
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:18.940]   to redeem and to rescue itself, and seeing the failure, sent the only one who could succeed.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.940]   He saw.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.900]   He knew.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:36.980]   It is God alone who really does know the truth about us, and about our conditions.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.460]   God sees the rebellion in the human heart.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:46.620]   He sees the vice, the malice, the perversion, the horror of it all.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.060]   You and I have no conception of sin.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.460]   It's God who sees what sin is, and what it has meant.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:58.180]   And yet though he knows it all, as our Lord knew all about his men, he nevertheless sends
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.580]   his Son, and the Son came.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.580]   Why?
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.340]   Well because of his mercy, because of his compassion.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.340]   That's the gospel you see.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:16.300]   The Son of God came into this world because the world is as it is.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:24.140]   He said, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.860]   This is the word I find everywhere in the gospels.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.620]   He was walking along, he suddenly sees a case of misery, and we are told he had compassion
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.620]   upon him.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:38.060]   He'd stop, he'd speak, it doesn't matter what he was doing, however great the hurry, he
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.420]   always, he had a heart of compassion.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.220]   He saw the people as sheep without a shepherd.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:49.900]   That's why he came, and that is why he still comes as it were.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:59.620]   It is the mercy and the love and the compassion of God revealed in Jesus Christ.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.020]   But I imagine somebody's anxious to ask this question, "Why did he go to that particular
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.020]   man?"
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.460]   There were many there.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.300]   Why did he go to this particular man?
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.360]   The answer is, "I don't know."
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.580]   But he did it, you know, and that's the sort of thing he does.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:24.620]   Is it, I wonder, because this man was the most hopeless case of all?
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:29.020]   Did he select him in order to show this, that if that man could be healed, anybody can be
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   healed?
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:36.020]   Did he want to show that there was hope for the vilest and the most wretched, the one
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:42.220]   that's been abandoned by the world and all its sociology and its psychology and its philosophy
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.220]   and all its otherologies?
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:50.820]   Did he go to the most hopeless, that the whole world might know forever that it doesn't
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:57.340]   matter how black a sinner is, how vile and wretched, the Son of God can save him?
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.660]   I don't know.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.020]   But I know he does things like that.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.820]   And I read the story of the Christian church throughout the centuries, and you know, I
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.260]   see him doing the same sort of thing.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.620]   He picks out the most unexpected people.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.280]   He selects the most extraordinary cases.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.620]   He takes all the men whom everybody's abandoned and everybody's forgotten, and he speaks
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:30.740]   the word, and the hopeless arises and becomes a saint, adorning the life of the Christian
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.940]   church.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:39.180]   Have you got a clear picture of this, Lord?
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.980]   You understand why he came into this world?
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   What's his purpose?
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.540]   What's his object?
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:50.180]   Not the righteous sinners Jesus came to save.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.740]   He says, "I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance, they that are whole
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.380]   have no need of a physician, but they that are sick."
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:05.180]   He comes for those who feel hopeless and utterly helpless, and works his miracles upon them.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.700]   Come, let me hurry to my last principle, which is this.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.340]   The salvation that he brings.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.500]   We've looked at the man, we've looked at the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   Now notice the salvation that he brings.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.500]   It's all here.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:22.420]   Here's the first thing I notice about it.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:29.900]   This salvation is entirely and altogether different from the world's methods, and entirely
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:35.500]   different from what the world and all of us would ever have expected him to do.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.420]   Had you noticed that?
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.420]   You see, look at this man.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.420]   Our Lord comes to him and says, "Wilt thou be made whole?"
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.660]   And there is no doubt at all about it.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.100]   The man was really saying in his reply something like this.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:52.980]   He says, "I have not got a man who can help me to get in there first, therefore my case
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.980]   is hopeless.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.780]   Are you asking me your question because you are prepared to help me to get in the next
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.820]   time the water is troubled?"
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:06.740]   Very natural, isn't it?
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.980]   What we all think by nature is that all we need from the Lord Jesus Christ is a little
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.820]   help and a little assistance.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.620]   We say the means of cure are there in the pool.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.620]   All I need is somebody to put me in.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.260]   I haven't got the money, I haven't got this or that.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.540]   Are you prepared to do it?
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.540]   Put me into the pool.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.060]   That's what we expect.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:29.340]   You know that isn't what he does.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.380]   We think, I say, we need a little help, a little fillip, a little assistance, a little
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.580]   encouragement, a little instruction, an example.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.420]   No, no, my friends, that isn't his method at all.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.380]   That isn't the Christian message, that isn't the Christian way of salvation.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:51.700]   Indeed, let me put it specifically in my second point by putting it like this.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:58.140]   You notice that our Lord doesn't use the pool at all.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.620]   He heals this man without the pool.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.140]   The pool wasn't disturbed, and our Lord didn't help him into the pool.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:12.180]   He just looks at him and says, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:19.500]   And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.660]   He doesn't make any use whatsoever of the pool, which being interpreted spiritually
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.580]   just means this.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:35.100]   This gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has nothing to do with human learning or philosophy or
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.100]   understanding.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.020]   It doesn't use them at all.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.980]   It's something that comes direct by the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:49.260]   It doesn't postulate anything in men except his need, his helplessness, his hopelessness,
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.260]   and his despair.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:38:00.340]   This isn't something that has come into the world to help men or to help the medicaments
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.700]   that men are already using.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.260]   It acts independently of them all.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.620]   Our Lord was never trained as a Pharisee.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.580]   He didn't belong to the schools, and because he didn't they said, "How can this man
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.580]   do it?"
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.580]   But he did it.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.580]   Why?
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.460]   Well, he's the Son of God, and he acts directly.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.060]   He doesn't need the pool.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.020]   All that you and I have got, he can leave them entirely undisturbed.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.220]   He doesn't act through politics, you know.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.220]   That isn't the way the world's going to be put right.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.280]   It isn't by Christianizing politics.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.340]   It isn't by Christianizing education.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.980]   It isn't by Christianizing industry or any one of these other things.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   No, no.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.340]   It's this action of his in a meeting like this.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.420]   He doesn't need them.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.740]   He doesn't use the pool.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:57.100]   And the third thing I notice is that we needn't be at all disturbed or afraid that the competition
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.940]   of others is going to rob us in this matter.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:07.020]   Poor fellow, he'd been there thirty-eight years, and he said, "What chance do I stand?
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.580]   Some of these others can rush in.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.980]   Some of these others can drag themselves in.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.140]   Others are wealthy enough to have servants, and they can put them in.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   I'm at a disadvantage."
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:25.580]   The competition was too key, and he didn't stand a chance at all.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.260]   Thank God.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.980]   It isn't like that with regard to this Christian salvation.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.900]   Nobody has an advantage here.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.620]   Money doesn't help a man here.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.620]   Learning doesn't.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.620]   Understanding doesn't.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.460]   Ask someone, "You know, I wish I'd got a great brain.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.380]   I can't even enjoy the Bible.
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.300]   I can't read books on theology.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.700]   What chance do I stand?"
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.980]   You stand as much chance as the greatest brain the world has ever seen.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.580]   You haven't been to the schools and the colleges.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.060]   Thank God it doesn't matter here.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.660]   It does in the world, of course.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.500]   The more you have, the more you'll get.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.420]   If you've got intellect, influence, money, they're all of great advantage.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.360]   Here, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.700]   When you come in through these doors, you come in like everybody else.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.100]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.700]   "Ah, but," he said, "surely it's an advantage to have been brought up in a Christian home.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.740]   It's an advantage always to have gone to a place of worship."
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:30.180]   In some respects it is, but in this matter of salvation, it doesn't help at all.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.940]   It may be a hindrance.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:39.340]   So don't tell me that somebody else, because he or she is more religious than you, has
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.940]   got a better chance.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:45.220]   "Ah," someone else says, "now surely morality does make a difference.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:50.180]   If you knew what I've been, if you knew what I've done, if you knew the depths to which
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.340]   I've descended, why, I'm sure you'd say that I'm hopeless.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.020]   Now if I'd always lived a decent and clean and moral life like that other person, I'd
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.020]   see some hope."
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.500]   You know, that's all wrong at this point.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.020]   It doesn't come in at all.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.940]   There are inequalities in the world, not when you're confronted by Christ.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.860]   He proves it here.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.660]   It doesn't matter whether you've been the most moral, natural person the world has ever
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:23.020]   known, or whether you're the vilest and the blackest sinner that ever walked the streets
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.020]   of London.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:29.820]   Thank God, when you're looking into the face of the Son of God, you're both in the same
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.420]   level, and he can deal with both in exactly the same way.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.500]   He doesn't need the methods of the world.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.340]   He's not interested in our natural inequalities.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.980]   No, no, these things don't come in.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.540]   His method of salvation is entirely different.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.260]   It's a contradiction of all we've ever thought and all we've ever imagined.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.660]   But come, let me come to the second principle which follows from that.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:04.780]   You see, his method is different because it depends entirely upon him and upon his power.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.380]   He doesn't need the pool.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.660]   He doesn't matter what the condition of the man is.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.580]   Why, world, the power is in him.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.420]   It's all in Christ.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.820]   He doesn't need any help anywhere, from pools or men.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.980]   He simply has it all in himself.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:26.940]   He speaks the word and it happens.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:32.140]   And you know, that is the whole gospel.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:39.740]   Everything that you and I need and the whole world needs at this moment is in Jesus Christ
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:40.740]   himself.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.100]   It's all in him and it's nowhere else.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.100]   Let earth please the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.100]   That's why he doesn't need any assistance, you see.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.620]   It's in him.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.300]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, says Paul.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   Why?
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:08.100]   Oh, it is the power of God and the salvation to everyone that believes.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.180]   It's all in the gospel.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.320]   He doesn't need the help of the philosophers and the great religious geniuses and all the
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.420]   other people that we are hearing so much about.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.900]   He doesn't need any help from Hinduism or Buddhism or Confucianism.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.300]   They cannot help him.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.620]   It's all here and he needs no assistance.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.020]   It's all in him.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:32.500]   He is God's wisdom and God's power unto salvation.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:39.540]   So you see, he can turn his back to the pool and look at the men and say, "Now I've
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.980]   not come to help you into the pool.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:48.860]   I say to you, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk,'" and the men did it.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:58.620]   It is all in the Lord Jesus Christ and what he has done is he has come to give it to us.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.740]   What do you mean, says someone, by saying that it's all in him?
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:06.460]   Well, let me tell you what I mean is this.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.700]   Your salvation and mine is perfectly in Jesus Christ.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:18.580]   He came into this world and he took on human nature, your nature and mine, upon himself.
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.540]   He has become a man like us in order to rescue us and redeem us.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   And what has he done?
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:31.340]   Well, he first of all gave a perfect obedience to God and to God's holy law.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.860]   He has obeyed it absolutely perfectly.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:41.100]   "Ah yes, but there's the problem of my past sins, my guilt and my shame."
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.700]   Do you know he took that upon himself also?
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.020]   He took them upon him.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:58.020]   John the Baptist said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the whole
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.020]   world."
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.020]   He alone, he took them.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.020]   He's borne them.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.020]   He's taken the punishment.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.940]   He stood for the guilt and God has punished your sins in him.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.580]   He's carried them away.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.580]   He's blotted them out.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.540]   He's risen again.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:20.860]   And he gives that, his own nature, to all who believe on him.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.580]   He has conquered death and the grave.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:28.060]   He has brought life and immortality to light through his gospel.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.020]   Now then, you see, it's all in him.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.820]   He has done this for men.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.140]   He's kept the law.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.340]   God is satisfied.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.340]   The law is satisfied.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:41.980]   Sin has been punished, as God said it would be.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:48.100]   And he has conquered the last enemy and he has risen triumphant and he has ascended back
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.100]   into heaven.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:53.180]   Very well, the whole of salvation is in him.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.900]   So he comes to you in this meeting and he says, "Son, daughter, wouldst thou be made
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.900]   whole?
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:06.580]   Would you like to know that your sins are forgiven?
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.740]   That they've been blotted out and carried away?
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.420]   Would you like to have a new nature?
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.300]   Would you like to have the Holy Spirit in you and strength and power?
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.860]   Would you like to be able to smile in the face of death and laugh at it almost, and
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:25.540]   know that you're going to heaven beyond it and to glory indescribable?
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.460]   Would you like all that?
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:32.980]   If you would, I can give it to you all."
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.860]   You see, he hasn't come just to teach us how to save ourselves.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.540]   He's come to give us salvation.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.540]   It's a free gift.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.540]   He's got it.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.540]   He's earned it.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.540]   He's merited it.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.780]   He possesses it.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:50.820]   He has the power to pronounce us forgiven, to pronounce us as born again, to pronounce
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.700]   us as reconciled to God and heirs of God and everlasting bliss.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:01.660]   As he spoke to that man, he's speaking, I say it with reverence to the glory of God,
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.460]   he's speaking through my lips at this moment.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:14.380]   And he is telling you that you can be forgiven and reconciled to God and born again and receive
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.380]   a new nature.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.300]   When, when you say, "Can I have this?"
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:28.380]   Well, you notice the answer in verse 9, "And immediately, immediately, the man was made
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.500]   whole."
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.060]   He didn't prescribe a course of treatment for him.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.220]   He didn't tell him, "Now you do this and do it regularly and soon you'll begin to feel
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.020]   better and you'll get better and better and stronger and stronger."
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.300]   No, no, that's man, that's midsom, that's psychology, that's the world.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.100]   But it's methods, that isn't Christ.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.700]   Immediately.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.700]   You will never make yourself a Christian.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.660]   You're never asked to make yourself a Christian.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.900]   Can't make ourselves Christians.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.060]   Christ makes us Christians.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.900]   And you see, because it is he who makes us Christians, we can be Christians now, this
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.900]   minute.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   You don't wait a second.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.460]   You don't say, "Ah, let me go home and consider it."
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.820]   Well, you can consider it if you like, but you'll still have to come back to him.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.780]   You say, "But let me make myself a little bit better."
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:22.220]   What's the point of that when all your better is of no value and he gives you all?
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:30.540]   And you see that because it's all in him and because he gives it freely as a gift, we can
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.260]   have it here and now, at this moment, immediately.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:40.780]   If you don't see that you can become a Christian this minute, you don't see it at all.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.980]   If you see it, you can see that you can have it now, immediately.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.780]   He spoke and the man arose immediately and was made whole.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:58.580]   Let not conscience make you linger or a fitness fondly dream.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:06.460]   All the fitness he required is to see your need of him.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.460]   That's all.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.460]   Have you seen?
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:13.980]   Wilt thou be made whole?
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.900]   Have you got the desire within you to be made whole?
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.460]   You know, I believe that when our Lord asked this man the question, he created the desire
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.460]   within him.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.540]   The man had given it all up.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.540]   It was hopeless.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   He was filled with despair.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.540]   Thirty-eight years, all with somebody else.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   Ah, what's the use of anything?
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:34.220]   But when our Lord asks the question, the desire is kindled.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:38.340]   You know, as the Lord speaks to you, he creates the desire within you.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:43.500]   We're all dead in trespasses and sins, but when he speaks, he quickens us.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.460]   He makes us see our sin.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.340]   He makes us see our condition.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.240]   He makes us see how lost we are.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.460]   He makes us see death coming and the judgment, and we are alarmed.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.660]   He's created the desire.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:02.060]   As we look at him, we begin to see the hope.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.060]   He can do it.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.060]   Well, that's the next thing.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   Do you trust in him?
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.060]   Do you believe in him?
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:14.380]   "The message of the cross," says Paul, "is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.380]   that are saved.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:19.380]   It is the power of God."
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:27.660]   Do you believe, therefore, this evening, that the Son of God came into the world because
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:34.980]   he loved you, and he died on the cross for your sins, has borne your punishment?
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:35.980]   Do you believe that?
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.940]   Do you know you're forgiven at this moment in Christ, that he came to give you new life,
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.940]   which you can have now?
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.940]   Do you realize it?
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.940]   Do you believe it?
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:44.940]   Do you trust him?
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.940]   Well, obey him, believe.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:56.540]   Rise up and walk and prove that you're a new man in Christ Jesus.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.500]   Do you see the need?
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.500]   Do you believe him?
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:10.780]   And finally, let me urge you to do so by saying this.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:16.180]   Take these terrible words again in verse 14, "Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:21.980]   and said unto him, Behold, thou hath made whole sin no more, lest a worse thing come
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.980]   unto thee."
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:42.340]   And I would say the same tonight.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:52:12.260]   Look at this blessed person this evening, the Son of God who unseen is here.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.620]   And who speaks his word.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.020]   He tells you that he's the Son of God.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:26.060]   He came into the world to save you, to die for you and your sins on Calvary's cross,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:34.780]   to give you forgiveness, to reconcile you to God, to give you a new nature, a new birth,
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:43.460]   to make a new man or a new woman of you and a child of God and a joy there with him of
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:52.020]   the bliss and the glory, passing our highest imagination.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:53:00.860]   That will be the lot of all who having heard him, have believed on him and received his
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:15.940]   power, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved now, immediately.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.980]   Amen.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:21.900]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
