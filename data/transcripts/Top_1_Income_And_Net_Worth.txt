[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240]   technology law transactions, and litigation since 2008.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.480]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.840]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.840]   In this episode, I want to talk about what it takes to earn a top 1% income because as
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.360]   I was updating my post on the top 1% net worth amounts by age, I realized as of 2023, a top
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.500]   1% income is now $650,000 and above.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.600]   That sounds like a lot because back in 2015 or 2016, a top 1% income was closer to about
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.120]   $380,000 to $400,000.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.720]   And then in 2019, when I had last updated this post, a top 1% income was about $470,000.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:09.660]   So to go from $470,000 just in 2018 and 2019 to now $650,000 in 2023, that really shows
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.360]   that this mountain has turned into Mount Everest if you want to get to a top 1% income.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.800]   So it feels almost defeating in the sense that if you wanted to get there through a
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.560]   day job, to get to $650,000 plus, man, that's going to be really, really hard.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.600]   Because I remember back in my day, a managing director for example had a base salary of
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.520]   $400,000 and managing director is the top of the food chain in banking.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   Then the managing director would get a zero bonus if it's a bad year or maybe a bonus
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.960]   of $600,000 to a million.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.160]   So those folks would get to a top 1% income but fewer than 1% of employees would ever
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.720]   get to managing director level.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.240]   It would be more like 0.1%.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   So it does seem like the goalpost just keeps on moving and it demonstrates the power of
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.680]   inflation, the good and the bad.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.080]   Now where am I getting this data and how do I know whether this data is true?
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.920]   Well, we don't really know for sure what is exactly true just like we don't know exactly
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.600]   how many millions of Americans there are living in America.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.080]   But we have data from the IRS and the Federal Reserve Consumer Finance Survey report.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.520]   So we take the data as given and even if that data is manipulated, so long as it is manipulated
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   consistently, we can identify a trend.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.560]   The trend is it's taking a greater amount of income every single year to be a top 1%
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.000]   income earner.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.240]   What I wanted to do with this data is to figure out what a proper net worth should be by age
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.640]   if you made a top 1% income.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.840]   So basically we know a variable X which is a top 1% income and we can solve for Y which
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.600]   is a top 1% net worth amount by age and we can do some logical analysis about how to
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.200]   get there.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.320]   Based on the data, a top 1% net worth is about $13 million.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   That's household net worth and a household can be an individual or a couple.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.680]   We know this data is probably true because the government in all its infinite wisdom
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.440]   wants to tax the top 1% the most.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:40.280]   We know that the estate tax threshold per person in 2023 is $12.92 million and $25.84
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.520]   million.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.480]   So $12.92 million, very close to $13 million.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.760]   That's the level where the government wants to impose a 40% death tax on you so it can
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.040]   take more of your money after you're gone.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.100]   So estate planning is very wise especially for folks who reach that threshold or who
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.480]   plan to reach and surpass that threshold in their lifetimes.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.040]   So based on my experience trying to achieve financial independence, achieving financial
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.240]   independence in 2012 and also talking about the fears, the worries, the hopes, the blind
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.120]   spots, I believe a true level of financial independence where you don't really worry
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.360]   too much about money anymore, you feel like, "Ah, I am actually financially independent.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.840]   I don't have to take side jobs or consulting jobs.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.160]   I don't have to push my husband or wife to work so that I can feel financially independent."
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.720]   That multiple of gross income, average gross income is 20.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.980]   So in other words, if you have a $100,000 gross income, if you can achieve a net worth
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.480]   equal to 20 times that average gross income, that's $2 million.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.360]   If you can get to $2 million, I feel that you will finally truly feel financially independent.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.400]   You don't have to worry as much about money.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.520]   You have enough passive investment income to pay for your desired lifestyle and you're
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.400]   going to have future income in terms of social security.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.600]   Now I don't believe everybody needs to get to 20 times their average gross income in
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.920]   terms of net worth to feel financially independent.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.640]   This is just based on my experience and carefully looking within, talking to other people about
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.200]   how they felt about being financially free or independent at various multiples.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.360]   The multiple where you start feeling financially independent is about a net worth equal to
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.040]   10 times your average gross income.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.480]   There is the inverse of the 4% rule which is to use 25 times your average expenses to
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.320]   feel or be financially free.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.080]   I don't believe in that rule because expenses are too easy to manipulate.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.480]   You can say, "Oh, I have $100,000 a year in expenses so I need $2.5 million," right?
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.080]   But you can say, "Well, I'm going to live on ramen noodles and water so I can cut my
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   expenses down to $40,000."
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.120]   So suddenly, all you need is a million-dollar net worth.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.040]   That's fine but I think using a multiple of gross income is more honest and it's harder
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.480]   and it keeps you more disciplined because for most people, as they gain experience,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.400]   they tend to earn more money.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.800]   As we know, a lot of people tend to earn more money and then they end up blowing their money.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.760]   This is why using a multiple of gross income is a much better way to figure out what your
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.960]   target net worth should be.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.240]   We have all these variables.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.720]   20X is the promised land number.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.600]   650,000 is the top 1% income threshold.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.440]   We also can assume that as you get older, you're going to save more and invest more
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.300]   because your ideal target is 20X.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.280]   So you're trying to get to a 20X multiple as soon as you can.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.160]   This multiple increases as you get older.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.520]   So if you click over to the post, you look at this chart that I've created.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.740]   I start with the age 25 with a top 1% income of 650,000.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.520]   I keep that income consistent from ages 25 to 80+.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.200]   Now obviously, it's way harder to earn a top 1% national income of 650,000 at 25 versus
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.040]   65 or 70.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.880]   But I can't play around with this variable because I want to solve for the Y variable
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.340]   of the top 1% net worth by age.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.560]   So what I've done is I've manipulated the ideal income multiple and I've started at
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.100]   age 25 an ideal income multiple of 0.5.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.180]   So a top 1% net worth for a 25-year-old is about 325,000.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:55.100]   At age 30, the ideal income multiple for net worth is 2.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.540]   So that's 1.3 million.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.280]   At age 35, the multiple grows to 5.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.540]   So that's 3.25 million.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.320]   At age 40, the multiple grows to 10, 6.5 million.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.420]   So think about it.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.620]   At age 40, you've worked for let's say 20 years, maybe 18 years.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.780]   It depends on when you graduated or what you did after high school.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.980]   But you have that amount of time to save and invest.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.780]   10X multiple, that jives well with the multiple I think is when you start feeling financially
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.820]   independent no matter what your income.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.060]   When the top 1% income is 650,000, we arrive at 6.5 million.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.980]   At age 40, now 45, the multiple grows to 13.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.700]   So the top 1% net worth is 8.45 million.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.020]   Age 50, the multiple grows to 15.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.620]   We got 9.75 million.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.100]   Age 55, the multiple grows to 18.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.020]   Now we have 11.7 million.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:09:00.100]   Then by age 60, the multiple finally gets to the ideal multiple of 20.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:06.940]   With the ideal multiple, voila, you get 13 million as a top 1% net worth.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.820]   That jives perfectly with what a top 1% net worth is in America today.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.860]   20 multiple, 13 million, 650,000, top 1% income.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.340]   Then the subsequent ages, I raise it a little bit to 22 multiple when you're 65 because
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.420]   you're still maybe making more from your investments than you're spending.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.880]   So that top 1% net worth goes to 14.3 million.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:37.980]   But then the multiple goes back down to 20 because of the estate tax threshold of 12.92
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.180]   million per person.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.640]   You don't want to have much more than 12.92 million per person because 40% of every dollar
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.420]   over that estate tax threshold gets taxed at a 40% rate.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.700]   So that would be a waste.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:56.780]   So you want to, as you come to the end of your life, spend more, give more, and ideally
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:02.340]   die with an estate value equal to the estate tax threshold.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.500]   Now obviously that's very hard to do.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.280]   It's probably better to just give the money away and spend it as you live.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.080]   So if you're much under the estate tax threshold, that's fine.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.960]   You live a good life and you consumption smooth more appropriately.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.580]   Now I know some of you might be rolling your ears and thinking, "Well, this is not going
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.940]   to relate to me because I have a far, far way to go to get to a top 1% net worth or
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.940]   income."
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.940]   And that's fine.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.440]   I think it's just good to know what these reach targets are.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.900]   You don't have to get there to be happy.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.680]   I think ideally you want a large enough net worth and income to be happy.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.800]   You want to be happy to have the freedom to do what you want, to work with good people,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.520]   to provide for your family, your parents and friends.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.840]   These are the reasons why you are striving to earn more and build your net worth.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.400]   Ultimately, you want to have the freedom to do what you want when you want to do it.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:01.340]   But I'm telling you folks, you don't need a top 1% income or a top 1% net worth by age
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.960]   or overall to be happy.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.800]   You can be happy way sooner.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.040]   You just need to earn enough to take care of your basic living expenses and to provide
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   for your family.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.920]   Then after that's done, focus on purpose and meaning and community.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.960]   You need those friends, folks, the people who will support you through those ups and
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.200]   downs because life is full of ups and downs.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   I have personally gone through the grind of working 70, 80 hours a week to try to get
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.880]   to a top 1% income.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.800]   I got there for several years and I wasn't happier.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.200]   In fact, I was more stressed.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.840]   My lower back was killing me.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.400]   I had sciatica.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   I had plantar fasciitis.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.680]   I had TMJ where I couldn't really even speak for more than 15 minutes.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.160]   I was grinding my teeth.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.120]   My hair was falling out.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.280]   My hair was turning gray.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.920]   All this to try to earn a top 1% income and have a top 1% net worth.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.240]   I'm not sure if it's worth it.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:10.040]   If you do get there, make sure you figure out a way to keep that net worth figure.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   Protect it.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Keep it diversified.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.080]   That's why we've been talking about, "Wow, Treasury bonds at 5% plus risk-free.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.760]   Not too shabby."
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.040]   People who invest in stocks and other risk assets think, "Oh, well, it's only 5% and
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.120]   you could have made 10+% of the stock market."
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   I'm just saying once you get to that amount of wealth, you never want to go back because
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.000]   you know often how hard it took for you to get there.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.720]   Thank you everyone for listening.
