[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Part of the value of this whole process is that it requires you to pause and actually
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.680]   look back at your work, writing, projects, you know, things that you did during the course
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.680]   of the year.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.860]   Because that actually gives you the zoomed out perspective.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.880]   Like the whole value of doing an annual review like this is really that you're constantly
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.480]   living in a first person view.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.200]   You're zoomed in as far as you can possibly be.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.840]   And this forces you to zoom out.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.960]   You're like, you know, a bird flying to 10,000 feet and now observing your full year and
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.960]   being able to do it.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.000]   So for me, I'm a writer.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.360]   That's kind of my primary thing.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480]   So I can actually go back and look at all of my writing during the course of the year
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.520]   and see, find those trends, look at things that I was talking about, thinking about,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.480]   and how those might have morphed or changed.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.320]   For a lot of people, it can be journaling, you know, notes that you've left yourself
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.000]   during the course of the year.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.320]   Some people send themselves emails.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.360]   I like doing that a lot from time to time.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360]   Note documents.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.120]   Sometimes it's just conversations with friends.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.400]   money and travel.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.000]   Now, just last month, I read a few posts that really had me thinking more about how I want
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.240]   to optimize 2023.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.840]   One was about conducting a personal annual review and the other was about 23 ways to
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440]   make 2023 an amazing year.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.660]   They were both fantastic and they were both written by my friend Sahil Bloom, who is one
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.880]   of my favorite creators.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.960]   But he actually started his career in private equity and spent a decade investing professionally
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.440]   before turning to write about finance and sharing his frameworks for having a more fulfilling
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.200]   life and career.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400]   In preparation for this conversation, I came up with so many topics I wanted to cover,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.100]   but we're just going to have to get to them another time because we're going to focus
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.160]   on conducting a personal annual review, which is nothing like the arduous process of a performance
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.240]   review at work.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.420]   It's actually just seven questions you can ask yourself that give you the perfect opportunity
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.280]   to reflect on the past year and plan for what's ahead.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.600]   Then we'll walk through some of Sahil and my top recommendations for how to make 2023
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.200]   an amazing year across your work, your health, your life and your money.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.680]   I'm really excited for this conversation, so let's get started right after this.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.440]   Sahil, welcome to the show.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.520]   Thank you for having me, man.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.160]   As an avid listener, I'm excited to make my debut appearance here.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.400]   Yeah, and we'll probably get to this at the end, but there might be some future appearances
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   coming.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   But it's January.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.280]   There are a lot of people out there trying to make their resolutions, make their intentions
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680]   for the year.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.160]   What do you think people get wrong when they go through that process?
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.200]   Yeah, I mean, the biggest thing I think people get wrong is focus on the planning side and
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960]   not enough on the reflecting side.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.480]   There's this quote that I love, John Dewey is an American philosopher.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.280]   And basically what he said was, "We don't learn from experience, we learn from reflecting
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.640]   on experience."
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   And I always thought that was a really powerful way of thinking about your year, like you
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.000]   get to the end of the year and everyone's instinct is, "Okay, I'm going to look forward.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Let me make my goals.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.040]   Let me do all that."
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920]   And that's just like the way everyone operates.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.240]   It's the standard.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   And not enough time is spent reflecting on the year that just passed.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.440]   And what did you learn from it and how can you actually take those learnings and drive
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.400]   yourself forward and do a better year going forward?
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.880]   I was hoping you'd say that because I wanted to talk about your personal annual review
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.120]   because I've seen you tweet about it and then you actually produced this document that people
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   could download.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.560]   I kind of want to walk through it.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.240]   So you think we could just kind of give people an overview of how you structure an annual
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.720]   review and then if anyone listening wants a copy, we'll definitely link to it in the
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   show notes.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.080]   I mean, it's a pretty simple structure as you know there.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.760]   I've been doing this for the last five plus years, I would say in this format.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   And you've had or had discussions with a few of these people, but I've taken inspiration
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.340]   over the years from a lot of the giants that I really look up to and admire like Tim Ferriss
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.880]   or James Clear, who have written about in the past their annual review structures.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.480]   And so, I've sort of adapted that.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.120]   But basically, the whole thing is framed around seven questions.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.200]   So maybe we can just go through the questions.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.880]   You and I can chat about them a little bit.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.960]   I'm curious for what your perspectives are on your own year on these and we can go from
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   there.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   I'm so glad you put this together and that we're having this conversation because I went
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.920]   through and I started going through all of this myself.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.280]   And yeah, I don't think I would have done that without your prompt.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.480]   It's like you jump in and you're like, "I got all this stuff to do this year."
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.360]   So I think this was a great process for me.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.440]   I hope other people take that away from it.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   Let's just jump in.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.480]   Number one.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.440]   So the first one that I always start with is, "What did I change my mind on this year?"
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.920]   It's the first question I always ask.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.520]   And the genesis of this is really just this idea that if you're not changing in any way,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   you're dying.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   We need to adapt.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.000]   We need to have those software updates as I like to think of them to our mind, to rewrite
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.800]   the old code and refresh it with new things.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.840]   And so, at the end of the year, I always like to ask, "What are the big things that I really
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   changed my mind on?"
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.320]   And if there's nothing, I start to get really worried.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.480]   That's when the tension starts to build.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.440]   So that's always the first question that I ask.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.560]   And I'm curious, for you specifically, actually, what are some of the things that you feel
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.000]   like you changed your mind on this year?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And I'm happy to give you mine.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So I'll run through it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.400]   But I have one quick question, which is, for each of these things, is there anything you
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.600]   do that helps jog your memory?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.500]   For me, I was looking through my photo albums.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   Where was I this year?
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.960]   To try to just anchor some points on things, or I was looking at my work calendar.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.740]   I was trying to figure out...
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.240]   It's not that I didn't change my mind.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.920]   How do I find the things I changed on without too much recency bias on what did I change
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.280]   my mind on in December?
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.080]   I mean, part of the value of this whole process is that it requires you to pause and actually
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.440]   look back at your work, writing, projects, things that you did during the course of the
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   year.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.400]   Because that actually gives you the zoomed out perspective.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.160]   The whole value of doing an annual review like this is really that you're constantly
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.720]   living in a first-person view.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.120]   You're zoomed in as far as you can possibly be, and this forces you to zoom out.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.500]   You're like a bird flying to 10,000 feet and now observing your full year and being able
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   to do it.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.240]   So for me, I'm a writer.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.600]   That's my primary thing.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.720]   So I can actually go back and look at all of my writing during the course of the year
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.760]   and see, find those trends, look at things that I was talking about, thinking about,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.720]   and how those might have morphed or changed.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.880]   For a lot of people, it can be journaling, notes that you've left yourself during the
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.280]   course of the year.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.600]   Some people send themselves emails.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   I like doing that a lot from time to time.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Note documents.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.680]   Sometimes it's just conversations with friends.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's also a reason, by the way, why these annual reviews are often really productive
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.360]   to do in a group setting or in a one-on-one setting with another individual that you trust,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.560]   because it tends to lead to a slightly more active discussion and pushbacks that actually
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.920]   make you think a little bit more deeply and avoid that recency bias that you mentioned.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.080]   For me, for some reason, and maybe it's that I live in the Bay Area and there's no seasons,
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.400]   so I don't have this like, "What was happening when it was snowing?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.160]   What was happening during summer?"
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.260]   I like to use the calendar and go back and look at calendars and photos to just jog my
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.960]   memory of like, "What happened in spring?
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.320]   Oh, I went on this trip to New York or Boston or something.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.520]   Oh, what was going on at work around the time I did that?"
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.640]   So that was my version.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.220]   But I've done that recently, by the way, with my wife.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.440]   So we just had our sixth anniversary and we were on a walk and we started thinking about,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.400]   "Okay, what did we do each year since we got married?
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   What were the big milestones, trips, things we did?"
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   And it was such a fun and interesting exercise to think about what our mindset was at each
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.800]   of these points in life.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.220]   We got married and then you have the honeymoon period and you're going on all these trips
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.480]   and what were you thinking about and doing?
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.220]   It's actually a really fun relationship exercise for people that have been in longer-term relationships.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.760]   I'll share one thing and then I'll promise I'll answer your question, which is starting
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   in...
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.320]   I don't know why, March of 2014, I started logging this doc --it's just a Google Sheet--
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.480]   called "Monthly Experiences".
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.940]   And my goal was that every month, for the rest of my life, I needed to have an experience
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.920]   that made that month memorable.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.140]   I first was like, "Was it monthly memorables, was it monthly experiences?"
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.520]   And it didn't necessarily have to be some crazy skydiving kind of thing.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.520]   One of them was like, I had surgery on my foot because I had this thing called a Morton's
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.120]   Neuroma and it had been a pain in my life for a long time.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.080]   And finally, I was just like, "I'm going to do this."
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.600]   One was, we were in Colorado where my wife grew up and it was like so much snow, it was
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   so cold.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   And I was like, "I'm going to go build an igloo."
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.140]   Like, get a chainsaw, cut blocks of ice and build an igloo.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.040]   So things like that, June 2015, we got a dog.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   So I don't know.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   This was one way.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.160]   It has nothing to do with an annual review, but it was...
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.680]   I wanted to make sure that every month of my life, there was something memorable.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.320]   And it went, it went, it went.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.400]   And I was like, "Gosh, it really dropped off a cliff."
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.640]   It dropped off a cliff when I had kids and the pandemic hit.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.760]   And I need to resume it.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.240]   But it was like, "Oh, when the pandemic was here and you have kids, yeah, there was something
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.040]   memorable with childhood development each month, but it felt weird to be like, 'Kids
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   smiled.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   Kids said, 'Dad.'"
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.520]   It was so focused on that.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.400]   So I got to get it back going.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.880]   But something to encourage everyone to consider if you're wanting to make sure each month
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   has something exciting.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.880]   I love that idea.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   It's great.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   All right.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.040]   So a few of the things for me was that one was around outsourcing.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.360]   I think I have always been someone...
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.000]   In multiple jobs, I've had the opportunity to have an admin and I just always said no.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I always said no.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I was taking everything into my own hands.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I loved optimizing.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.700]   And finally, this year, when I started the podcast, out of necessity, well, I started
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700]   last year, but...
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.700]   Two years.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.700]   Sorry.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.700]   Two years.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.160]   But last year in 2022, I really started saying, "Okay, maybe I could hire someone to help
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   do some research.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.320]   Maybe I could hire someone to help with parts of the newsletter, with parts of the editing,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   with parts of the production."
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.200]   So last year was a year that I changed my mind on hiring people to help do things to
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.040]   give you more surface area you can cover with your own time.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.280]   That was one.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   That's a powerful one.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.760]   I mean, that's going to pay dividends for a long time, changing your mind on that.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.720]   The other one, which I think was the hardest, was learning to spend money.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.960]   And I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like myself and maybe a lot of people listening,
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.620]   we almost get to the point of optimizing and frugality that it's very hard to spend money
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.520]   on anything.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.200]   We're going out to dinner and I remember we're at a Japanese restaurant and I was like, "All
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.600]   I want is a miso soup."
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.040]   That just felt like what I wanted today.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.620]   And I was like, "God, they're charging $7 for a miso soup.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.040]   I feel like a miso soup should be $3 or $4."
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.040]   And I was like, "You know what?
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.800]   I just need to stop worrying about..."
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.120]   I'm so used to telling people, "Stop worrying about the latte."
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   It's not about the latte.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   It's a Ramit Sethi thing.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.840]   He's like, "The lattes aren't what's killing you.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   It's these big decisions."
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   And here I am, not ordering the...
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.600]   To use the Japanese restaurant example, not ordering a seaweed salad because I like it
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.560]   because it's extra $5 or not getting miso soup because it's overpriced by $2.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:05.320]   And so I found that when you can just let the small decisions go, happiness goes up,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   stress goes down, anxiety goes down.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.760]   When it comes to optimizing my finances, where I am in my life, those $1, $2, $3, $4, $5
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.360]   differences weren't having a big impact.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.200]   And so I've changed my mind on that a lot.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.560]   When I'm shopping online for groceries, I would pull up Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.120]   and price compare strawberries and stuff like that.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.400]   I've gotten over the small costs of things and gotten comfortable.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.680]   Those are 2 things.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.800]   And the one small funny thing that I'll share, which I put in my end of the year learnings
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.600]   was mouth tape, which I thought was that when I interviewed Liz Moody, who has this Healthier
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.360]   Together podcast, she was like, "You should consider trying this out, taping your mouth
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   at night."
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.920]   And I was like, "That is the craziest thing."
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.240]   And for all of 6 months, I was like, "That's the craziest thing."
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   And then I was like, "You know what?
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.000]   I'm just going to try it."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And it was awesome.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And I'm like...
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Changed your life?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.220]   Were you a big mouth breather before?
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.200]   I don't even know if I ever thought...
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.920]   It wasn't a thing that I processed in my mind.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.000]   But there were just times where I woke up and my mouth was a little dry.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.760]   And I was like, "Oh, I wonder if I'm a really heavy mouth breather or not.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   I don't know."
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   And then I tried it.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.240]   And I was like, "I woke up and it just felt like my mouth was fresh."
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.120]   I know it sounds like a weird thing to say.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.760]   Well, it's deeply impactful for your health.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   Breathing through your nose.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.560]   You should have James Nester on at some point.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.600]   He wrote the Bible on this recently.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   We've been going back and forth.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.040]   You should have him on and do an episode on breathing because it's hugely, hugely impactful
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   for your health.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   I just...
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   You write it off.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   It's like, "That's so silly.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   Why would you do that?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   That seems ridiculous."
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   And last year, I was like, "You know what?
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   Let's just try it."
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.360]   And now, I have like a stack of hostage tape, which is like the most ridiculous name for
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.620]   a mouth tape company on my bedside.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.000]   There is a general rule of thumb there, by the way.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.120]   And maybe it's like a David Foster Wallace, "This is water" takeaway as well of any time
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.520]   your bias is, "That's totally ridiculous.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.640]   That sounds silly.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.720]   That's wild."
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.920]   Just try it.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   Because half the time, those things that you're automatically highly, highly certain of, you
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.040]   end up being completely wrong on.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.000]   And maybe we would all learn a whole lot more about ourselves and grow in a different way
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.920]   if we just took on those things that we write off immediately.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.000]   Anything from your list this past year that's worth sharing?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.840]   The biggest one for me was a kid thing.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.300]   I think you know this, but we had our first son in May.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.560]   He was born.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:32.360]   And I had these like grand ambitions prior to him being born of all the things I was
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   going to teach him.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.520]   I had this long list that I had written out of all the stuff I was going to teach my son
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.080]   and how I was going to mold his personality in all these different ways.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   And I think somewhere around like the six-month mark, which was later in the year, I just
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.960]   realized that I don't think it's possible.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.880]   I basically think that kids come out with a sort of a kit and their personality and
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.480]   who they are and some aspects of their character.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   It's sort of fixed.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480]   It's like genetic.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   They come out with it.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.280]   And our job is actually not to try to teach them things around all of these specific values
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   that we want.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.880]   It's to be able to embody our values as a person and hopefully guide them in the general
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.700]   direction of what we believe is a strong set of values.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:19.200]   But the idea of like being able to mold and shape my child, I've given up on as something
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   that's possible.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.160]   It's funny because just this morning, I had a moment that further emphasized this for
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.480]   me, which was there were these three little felt balls and my daughter was playing with
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.880]   them and she's like, "Daddy, here you go."
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.480]   And she hands them to me and I start juggling them.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.720]   And she's like mesmerized.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.200]   And she's two and a half.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.840]   And I was just thinking, I guarantee and she's obviously too young to learn to juggle right
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   now.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.440]   I'm sure there's some savant kid in the world who could juggle a two and a half, but that
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   didn't seem possible.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.320]   She's got an X cube probably solving it.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.240]   But I was thinking, gosh, I bet if I went to her and was like, "Hey, let me teach you
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   how to juggle."
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.240]   She'd be like, "No, I don't want to teach you.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.960]   I want to do things on my own."
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   But just doing it.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.360]   Like if you want your child to maybe do something that you do or learn something, letting them
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.040]   emulate you and watch you and maybe admire and look up to it is probably going to be
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.400]   a 10 times more effective habit or way to do it than trying to force them to learn this
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.640]   thing that you want them to learn.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   I completely agree.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.440]   That's why I bring my son with me in my garage gym so that he can watch me work out.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.960]   He's like seven months old.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.280]   He's like, "I'm going to do that one day."
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.280]   Awesome.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Okay.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   Question two.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   Let's do it.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   All right.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.880]   So the second question and the third, it's kind of a two way to be, but two and three
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.400]   are all around energy.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.040]   And the second question is basically what created energy for you during the course of
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.160]   the year.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.960]   And this whole idea is to go back and look at your calendars.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.420]   You said you were already doing this for the first one, but go back and look at your calendars
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:54.160]   from the year and try to identify the trends in what actually created energy in your life.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.520]   What were the activities?
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.160]   What were the work projects?
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   What were the meetings?
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.500]   Who were the people?
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.360]   What were these trends that actually brought you energy?
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   So this was a fun one.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.320]   And actually, I guess people listening to this are probably not going to pause and go
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.240]   do one before finishing the episode, so they won't have this problem.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.520]   But I would definitely encourage people to listen to all of the...
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.240]   Listen or read all of the topics in the personal review and then go back and look at your calendar.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.280]   Otherwise, you'd go back, learn a bunch of things you changed your mind on and then have
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.280]   to repeat the process.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:29.240]   So this was really interesting because I think this past year was the first year that the
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.880]   kind of world opened up and I was a creator.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.020]   And I met a bunch of other people creating podcasts, YouTube, like all kinds of stuff.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.000]   And that's just never been a part of my career, right?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.200]   I met a lot of founders and investors and people in finance and financial advisors and
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.580]   planners, but I'd never really met a lot of creators.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.460]   And that was one thing that gave me a lot of energy because it's just I'm...
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.460]   As much as I...
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.860]   This is my new job, but I just have never been in this industry.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.860]   So that was a big one for me.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.620]   And then going on adventures with my daughter, just me and her.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:10.420]   We have two now, but we would ride our bike, I'd put her in the back, we'd ride the bike,
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.540]   we'd hop on Caltrain, we'd ride two stops on Caltrain, we'd get off, we'd go to the
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.140]   donut shop, we'd buy a donut and then we'd bike back home.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.880]   It's like those adventures were so much fun.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.460]   I have a bunch of other ones, but those are two I'll share.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.760]   And then the question to ask yourself, by the way, after you identify those activities,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.720]   those people, the projects is really, did I spend enough time on those?
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   Go look at it.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.080]   Was that like 2% of my time spent and I was actually just spending the rest of my time
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.160]   on other stuff?
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.300]   Because that's a question that you then need to answer as you think about what your next
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.300]   year looks like.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.040]   So for me, I probably have a somewhat similar one to you in that I get a ton of energy out
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.600]   of creative activities.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:59.040]   And that's writing for me is a huge one, conversations with smart, interesting people is another
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   one.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.560]   And I had to find smart, interesting, extremely broadly, by the way, this isn't like talking
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.080]   to successful people is what I get excited about.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.540]   I have fascinating conversations with Uber drivers, with people that are helping me with
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.540]   things around the house.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:17.100]   Like I find that you can learn from almost anybody when you open up to it.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.120]   And I get a ton of energy from hearing different people's stories, different people's struggles.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.760]   It ends up inspiring a lot of the things that I end up writing about as well.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.080]   So that's a huge, huge energy creator for me.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   And then the last one is sort of productive leisure as a category.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.720]   I think about it, walking is a huge one for me.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.640]   I probably averaged close to 20,000 steps a day in 2022, which was a huge number for
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.320]   me relative to anything I'd done in the past, largely because my son would only sleep when
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.920]   he was taking on walks outside.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.760]   And so it forced me to be outside a lot.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.800]   And I just found that I was getting so much creative energy from walking and being out
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.080]   in nature.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.880]   So that was another big learning for me.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.120]   And to compliment that with what drained energy, I guess, is the next one, right?
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.240]   And it kind of goes in tandem.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.160]   As we said, when you look at your calendar, you're figuring out what were the things that
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   created energy.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.180]   And then you're looking at the same time at what was the stuff that just drained me.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:16.360]   And for a lot of people, this tends to be stuff like back-to-back meetings, phone calls,
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.960]   the meetings to talk about future meetings, processing email, doing things that are sort
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.460]   of monotonous activities that happen to hijack your day a lot of the time.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.420]   So figuring out what those activities are, what the trends are in them, and then figuring
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:37.080]   out if you allowed those to take over your entire day, or if you were able to sort of
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.960]   manage the balance that has to naturally exist across the energy creators and energy drainers.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.800]   Funny enough, I think I took this in a slightly different perspective, which was it wasn't
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.120]   the back-to-back meetings, all that stuff.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.080]   There were two things that I put here that I'll share.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.600]   One was fitting our children into our old life.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:04.000]   So my wife and I probably clocked in four, five, six, seven trips a year when we were
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.680]   kidless pre-pandemic, whether they were weekend trips, or drives, or international trip.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.880]   And I think we had a great time in December going to London and Paris with two kids.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.240]   But I think trying to fit two small kids into the type of trip we would normally take actually
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.800]   drained a lot of energy.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.640]   And I think we probably would have been better off trying to think about the trip not from
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:32.020]   a how do we get the best of both worlds, but how do we maybe have one trip a year where
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:38.480]   we can get away on our own, and one trip where we're taking it in a way that doesn't require
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.960]   as much effort and kind of burden, especially when kids are napping one, two, three times
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   a day.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.240]   It's just you're not going to have that same experience.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.920]   So that was one.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:55.380]   And the other one was social media, just feeling the need to put pressure to "Oh, I gotta post
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.960]   this much, this many places."
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.680]   I was like, I found the content area that I love right now, just recording a podcast,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   writing a newsletter.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   I really love those two things.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.920]   But it drained me every time I was thinking, "Oh, how do I clip it to a short form video
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.160]   and post it here and here?"
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.480]   And I think, we'll get to this later, because I have some other thoughts, but that was one
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   where I think it just drained.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.120]   Just trying to think about those things.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.100]   That one drains a lot of people, I think, in the creator ecosystem.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.600]   You can spread yourself way too thin across all of these different platforms and get a
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.880]   lot of FOMO about like, "Oh, so-and-so is growing their podcast a lot by doing this,
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.840]   this and this on that platform.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   to be doing that."
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:42.800]   And it just pulls you in that direction mentally, and the cognitive load ends up being just...
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.580]   It destroys you.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.580]   Anything that drained you?
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.120]   I mean, the biggest one for me is always calls and meetings.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.400]   Calls and Zoom meetings, I should say.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.920]   I love in-person meetings.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.320]   And so my big takeaway was calls, like the get-to-know-you calls.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   I'm just not doing anymore.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.320]   I'm just not going to do those.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:07.240]   And my way to make sure that I still have those get-to-know-you things is doing them
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.520]   in person.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.320]   And basically, I'm an open book of meeting people in person in New York.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.400]   And New York, fortunately, tends to be one of the places that basically everyone comes
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.120]   through at some point or another.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.120]   And so if someone reaches out to me and they live in Vancouver and they want to get together,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.040]   and I'm not doing calls because I'm not going to do a get-to-know-you call, they tend to
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.240]   be coming to New York at some point within the next six months, and we will get together
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.080]   in person and meet that way.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.800]   And it's been awesome so far since I started implementing the change.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.160]   Just the energy of meeting someone in person, the friendships that get formed, it's just
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   on a different level from the Zoom call that you end up leaving and saying, "Hey, we should
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.880]   get drinks sometime," and you end up never connecting with the person in the future.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   That for me is definitely number one going into this year.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.040]   Going into this year, the other thing I'm going to do on that point is just if someone
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   says, "Can we do a meeting?"
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.760]   I'm just like, "Can we just do the phone call?"
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   It doesn't...
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.600]   Not every video call has to be a video call.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.120]   I think that if this wasn't a video call, I feel like maybe we wouldn't connect as well.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.360]   But I'm not sure every call that everyone does...
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.760]   When we had a quick conversation before this, we did it on the phone, and it was fine.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.880]   And you can do phone calls while walking, by the way.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.240]   A huge, huge unlock for me is just like, "I'll do phone calls while walking now when I need
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   to."
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   And it's a big unlock.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.600]   It's really clear when you're walking that way.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.640]   And so unless you need to be in front of your computer for a specific reason, walking meetings
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.800]   are awesome.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.320]   And if someone pushes back, if you want to prevent the pushback, they're like, "Hey,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.320]   let's do a video call."
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   I say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.680]   I find that when I'm doing a call on my computer, I'm a bit more distracted because there's
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   email popping up.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.240]   So maybe we do a phone call, and I'll just go on a walk, and I'll be completely focused
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   on you."
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   How's someone going to push back there?
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.900]   You're like, "Do you want my attention or do you want part of it?"
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.880]   And it's 100% accurate, by the way.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.280]   Think about how many windows you typically have up during a typical Zoom call and how
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.920]   often you're checking the notifications that pop up in the screen or looking at the internet
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.320]   or your email or whatever it is.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.080]   It's totally true.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.360]   Question four, this is one of my favorites.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.840]   What or who were the boat anchors in my life?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   And boat anchors is a term that I created, so I need to explain it.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.760]   As you would expect, it is the thing that is creating drag on your life.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.620]   So when I think about boat anchors, I typically think about them as people.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.880]   And these are the people that are trying to hold you back.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.960]   It's the people that sort of snicker or laugh when you tell them what your ambitions are.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.800]   It's the people who put down your accomplishments or try to say that they're not as impressive
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   as they otherwise were.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   It's also the people who are saying that about others when you're talking to them, and they're
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.400]   putting down others just in the general context of conversation.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   These are boat anchors.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.040]   These are people that are literally placing a drag on your progress and holding you back
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.600]   from achieving at the next level that you're trying to get to.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.980]   So identifying who they are, sitting down and reflecting on the relationships and the
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:59.160]   things in your life that might be holding you back in that way is a huge, huge part
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.000]   of this reflection process because developing a plan to start minimizing the impact that
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.760]   those people have in your life is really key.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.720]   For the sake of not being boat anchors ourselves, I would say let's just skip through trying
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.000]   to talk about who these are in our lives and not be negative.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.060]   But I do think this is a productive step.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.320]   We all have these people.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.200]   And so it's just being really clear.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.020]   We don't need to talk about who ours are, but we all have these people in our lives
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.040]   and thinking about it clearly and sitting down and really reflecting on it.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.200]   And it doesn't have to be that you tell the person, "Hey, you're cut out of my life,"
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   by the way.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.560]   This is an important point.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:39.620]   You can identify these people and just slowly kind of minimize their role within your ecosystem.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.840]   You don't need to hang out with them all the time, maybe.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.760]   You don't need to touch base with them quite as much as you did or tell them about the
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.940]   things that you're working on or thinking about.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.900]   It's just figuring out a way to minimize the impact of their drag in your life.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.320]   Question five, what did I not do because of fear?
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.360]   This goes back to Tim Ferriss who developed, I think it was in 4-Hour Workweek, the first
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   time he talked about it.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.520]   But then there's a very famous TED Talk where he talks about it, fear setting, which is
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:15.680]   generally the idea that we allow our fears to distort our reality.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.520]   And we build them up in our minds as much worse than they really are.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.200]   And so, the concept of fear setting is to get much closer to your fears, to really deconstruct
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.960]   them and figure out, "Were they as bad as I thought?
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.560]   And what's the worst case that could happen?
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.280]   What's the upside if I actually go and do this?"
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.800]   And then proceed accordingly.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.040]   So, the whole idea is to go back and look at your year and figure out what did you actually
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.880]   shy away from doing and then think about, "Okay, well, let me break that fear down.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.340]   How real was it?"
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.800]   Because at the time, you just passed on the opportunity due to that fear.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.440]   For me, this was just going full-time on all the hacks.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   And it was so funny because a friend of mine, shout out to Ben who worked with me at Wealthfront,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.400]   who was like, "Why aren't you doing this?
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.480]   Why aren't you going full-time on this project?"
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.960]   And I was like, "Well, if I were giving my friend advice, I would tell them that they
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.200]   need to go full-time on it."
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   It was so obvious.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.880]   I could use all the mindset tactics that I've learned from interviewing smart people where
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.280]   it's like, "Oh, what would your friend say?
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.640]   Your friend says you should do it, then maybe you should take the advice."
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.440]   And I was like, "Well, I would give everyone advice.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.320]   You're at this point where this is the time to capitalize."
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.640]   And I just couldn't bring myself to do it.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.240]   Part of it was like, "Oh, maybe I'll wait till the end of the year.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   Maybe I'll wait here.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.560]   And I'm on parental leave and all this stuff."
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.080]   And I'm happy that I did it, but I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.360]   why it took me so long.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.240]   And I think that was one that I just needed to break down and spend more time reflecting
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   on.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.160]   The waiting for the perfect moment is the bias here that almost everyone has.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.720]   We tell ourselves we're going to do X at the perfect moment, and it's not the perfect moment
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   now.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.360]   And the reality is it's never the perfect moment to make those big leaps and to do those
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   big jumps.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.200]   And so, sometimes -- I've written about this -- sometimes you literally just need to open
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.000]   the door and jump out and hope the parachute was packed tight and just make that leap.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.600]   And so, deconstructing your fears and going through this exercise is really helpful.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.880]   I had the same one, by the way, when I was thinking about making the leap to full-time
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.240]   into these personal pursuits a year earlier.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.840]   So, in 2021, that was my thing that I held off on doing because of fear that ultimately
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.640]   sort of got forced upon me.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.320]   But that was definitely mine in 2021.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.920]   The other one is -- and I still have this fear -- so, when you have -- all of the businesses
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.800]   I've run have been venture capital-backed businesses, where all the money you have as
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.880]   a company, it's not like you get to keep it.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   Right?
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.360]   Basically, it's always in the company.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.880]   So you're really, really motivated to spend it all to try to grow and build a really big
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   company because the benefits to you only come if that company really succeeds.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.480]   When you run a small business, which I'll call a podcast a small business, it's like
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.280]   if that podcast makes money, you get the money.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.620]   That's how businesses that you own yourselves and you don't have investors work.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:16.240]   And so, one thing that I'm struggling with is to take that money and go reinvest it into
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:23.120]   the business, if you will, hiring someone to help research or book guests or edit and
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   produce.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.040]   I've been able to chip away at smaller pieces.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.920]   But making a big investment is something that I haven't been able to do yet.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:39.240]   And I see all these stories of successful business owners, not the venture capital startup
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   founder kind of people, but regular people.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.900]   And the overwhelming theme is that they all reinvested in their business to grow it.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.240]   And so it's like, "I know I need to do it.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   I know I should do it.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.360]   I would give my friends advice to do it."
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:55.080]   But it's so hard when it's basically like reinvesting your own money.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.640]   And I think the mindset shift that I had that was so productive for savings, personal savings,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.800]   was that every dollar I earned, I just immediately shelved in my brain as if it was my savings.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.040]   So I know a lot of people, the way they budget is...
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.160]   Or the way they spend money.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.640]   They spend their money, but maybe everything that's left over, they save.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.840]   Or they save $500 a month and everything else they can spend.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.600]   For me, 100% of the money was savings.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.280]   And I treated every single purchase as if I was saying, "Do I want to dip into my savings
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.720]   to buy this coffee?
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.540]   Do I want to dip into my savings to have dinner out?"
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.840]   That was my process, which made me incredibly frugal, probably not spend enough money and
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.000]   do enough things.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.840]   Now I have that same thing applied to business where it's like, "Do I want to dip into my
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.720]   savings to hire someone to do this thing?"
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.640]   And it just makes it harder to spend money.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   That's interesting.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.680]   So I did a structural thing from a business standpoint that might be useful for people
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:56.120]   that has been a behavioral hack for me, which is I have an S-corp that's set up that has
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.680]   all of my personal holding company entities running through it.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.880]   And all I do is with an S-corp, you have to pay yourself a salary, a reasonable salary
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   out of it.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.240]   And so that reasonable salary is what covers all of our home expenses and our whole life
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.340]   and everything there.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.620]   And so because of that, because it's two separate businesses, it runs from my S-corp that pays
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.060]   a salary out to our personal joint bank account as a family.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.800]   I then just think of that S-corp bank account as it's the working cabinet, it's the business,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   it's the working capital.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.160]   And so everything there in my mind is segmented as totally separate.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.860]   I need to think about reinvesting.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.860]   What does it look like?
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.860]   What's the margin profile?
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.040]   What's the return on this investment, etc.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.280]   And that's been a hugely, hugely helpful behavioral hack for me overall.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   So I just reclassified her.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.960]   I did my S-corp election at the end of the year.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.320]   So this is something that maybe will make it easier next year.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.720]   Yeah, it definitely will.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.160]   It definitely will.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.520]   The salary thing definitely makes a big difference versus the LLC.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.840]   Question six, ready?
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.760]   Greatest hits and worst misses from the year.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.640]   The reason for doing this one is because we are all swayed by our natural bias.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.480]   So an optimist will see all the hits from the year.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.960]   They'll look at their year and pat themselves on the back and say, "Wow, I had a great year.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.560]   Look, this, this, this, and this."
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.040]   And the pessimist stares at their year and says, "Oh my God, this was the worst.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.320]   I had all these things go wrong.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.880]   It was awful."
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.140]   Doing a actual explicit list of your hits and your misses forces you to sort of be balanced
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.560]   and actually take a real look at the two sides of your life and success from a scoreboard
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.560]   standpoint.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.500]   So writing them all down, I find, is hugely, hugely helpful.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.480]   Which side do you skew on?
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.680]   I would say I skew towards being self-critical.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.740]   It probably comes from my athletic background.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.980]   Negative self-talk was always how I motivated myself athletically, which is a funny thing
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.160]   to say these days because everyone is very big on positive self-talk.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.960]   I always motivated myself by telling myself it wasn't good enough or the things I was
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.800]   doing wasn't good enough.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.760]   As a result, if I sit down and think about my year, I tend to just glaze over the awesome
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.660]   things that happened and think about, "Oh, well, this didn't work out," or "I failed
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.660]   at this.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.660]   Quit this too early."
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.660]   Whatever.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.220]   And so it helps for me to zoom out and actually think about the wins to balance all of that
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.220]   out.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.220]   What about you?
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.000]   When it comes to the future, I'm definitely in the optimist camp.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.840]   I'm like, "It's always going to work out.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.380]   Kids are going to not even have jet lag when we travel."
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.620]   I'm always the one like, "What's the brightest side of things?"
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:36.900]   But when it comes to myself, I am always the person that's trying to find how to improve.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   And so I dig on the...
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.780]   I at least crave the criticism.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.100]   So if I'm cooking dinner for family and everyone's like, "This is great."
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.100]   I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.100]   Sure.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.100]   It's great."
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.100]   What could have...
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   Did it need a little more salt?
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.500]   Could I have cooked it a little longer?
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.580]   I know that I'm not a three Michelin star chef.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.640]   So telling me that this is fantastic, I want to know how to make it better.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.340]   So it's weird.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.260]   Forward-looking, I'm much better at thinking optimistically.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.780]   On myself and reflection, I'm more like, "God, I could have done this better.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.780]   I could have done this better."
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.940]   I definitely don't want honest feedback on my cooking from my family.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.260]   If I make steaks on the grill, I just want everyone to say, "These are amazing.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.260]   These are restaurant quality steaks."
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.260]   That's so funny.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.100]   When everyone says, "These are amazing," around our table, I get so frustrated.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.180]   I'm like, "No.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.220]   There's no way that this is a perfect steak.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.220]   What could have been better?"
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.060]   Well, you're going to end up accelerating as a chef and I'm going to stay at my low
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.060]   baseline.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.060]   That's okay.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.980]   I probably shouldn't focus on my cooking as much.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.380]   I'm clearly not going to have a profession in the culinary.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.380]   That's a good one though.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.380]   Okay.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.380]   Final question.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.820]   What did I learn this year?
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.780]   This is just the best place to wrap these up for me because it captures everything.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.260]   You just did all of these questions, you boil it all down and sit down and write down a
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.300]   list of the things that you learned, how did you grow, how did you learn, and how did you
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.980]   develop during the course of the year.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.860]   I always find this to be a great way to summarize the whole exercise and really have a set of
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.220]   key takeaways.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.620]   So I did this one wrong.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.300]   So I'm going to share my failed experience.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.620]   What did you do wrong?
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.460]   So I took it way too literally and I was like, "What did I learn?"
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.700]   And I was like, "Oh, well, Nick Gray taught me how to throw a good cocktail party."
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.940]   That totally counts.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.940]   I think that's great.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.940]   Sure.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.940]   Okay.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.940]   So maybe I didn't take it wrong.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:27.660]   But what I didn't do was, what did I learn from going through questions one through six.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.740]   I didn't do the tie it all up in a bow summary version of number seven.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.100]   I did the, "Here are all the things I learned."
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.260]   And I was like, "Wow, I could just go to every podcast because I learned a bunch of stuff
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   each episode."
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.780]   I just had this massive list of all these things I learned.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.380]   What would have been maybe more effective, which I will probably do this afternoon or
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:49.940]   this evening, is like, "Let's take the previous six questions in this entire process and try
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:55.500]   to put a bow on the whole thing and what I learned and what that means for life ahead."
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.380]   I think both are productive, to be honest.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.220]   I love the fact that you went and learned how to throw a good cocktail party from Nick
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   Gray who's awesome and best in class at throwing cocktail parties.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.820]   He threw an in-person event for Sam Parr and I that we hosted in New York this summer.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.300]   And I've never seen something so well-coordinated and organized.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.380]   It was amazing.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.780]   That guy is world class.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.340]   So that's a great one.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.620]   I love that one.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.700]   So obviously, we're talking about reflection.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.220]   But I want to talk a little bit about the year ahead.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.380]   But I do want to ask, you mentioned very briefly at the beginning, things that made it easy
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.580]   for you to go back, like journaling or sending yourself emails.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.180]   Are there things that people should be thinking about in the year ahead that will make this
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.060]   process easier in the future, whether it's a monthly review or journaling, things like
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.060]   that?
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.140]   I do a monthly review that I think is super important.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.940]   And I do this for a number of reasons.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.380]   The biggest one for me is when you have a plan for the year, which all of us, if you're
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:58.060]   listening to this podcast, you're probably a planner, you probably like to set your course
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.300]   for the year at the beginning and figure out where you're heading, your North Star, if
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   you will.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.140]   But the biggest challenge with that is a year is just such a long time and changing.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.460]   You get the whole one in 60 rule that I think was in Atomic Habits is if you're off by one
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.100]   degree you're heading, you're going to miss your target by a mile for every 60 miles flown.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.100]   And it's super, super impactful.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.460]   And I think about it a lot.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.940]   So I sit down at the end of every month, and I try to ask myself a set of questions and
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.700]   just reflect on the month from the past.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.940]   What were the really important things in my life?
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.300]   Was I focusing on those?
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.900]   Did I actually spend time on the really important things or was my attention grabbed elsewhere?
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.020]   Are my daily systems, the things that I'm doing on a daily basis, actually in line and
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.820]   aligned with what my long-term goals are, my midterm goals are?
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.500]   So I do sit down at the end of every month and try to either, for me personally, I like
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.860]   to write down by hand.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.940]   Some people like using Notion or some digital tool or sending themselves an email.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.700]   But for me, being able to have that then as a record that I can go back and look at, in
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.500]   addition to anything else I've collected from the year, like calendars, et cetera, tends
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.180]   to be a really helpful exercise.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.100]   You've published, I think, somewhere that monthly review process.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.100]   Is that right?
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:16.380]   I released an annual planning guide after the annual review guide, which has my whole
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.580]   kind of process for setting out the long-term goals.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.420]   I think about checkpoint goals that are in between the daily systems that come there,
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.420]   the anti-goals.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.420]   You know what?
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.980]   We want to avoid the Pyrrhic victory, avoid winning the battle, but losing the war with
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   these goals.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.340]   And then finally, how to think about tracking and adjusting, which is really that monthly
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.500]   review process.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   So I did have that out somewhere and people can find out.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.740]   We can put it in the show notes.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.740]   Perfect.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.460]   And journaling is something that I haven't adopted as a habit, but it seems like the
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.540]   data out there is like, it's a really good habit.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.300]   Like it seems like everybody should be doing it.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.580]   I finally figured out how to do this.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:56.740]   I mean, I spent five years, to be honest, like five years telling myself at the beginning
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.980]   of every year that I was going to become a journaler because of the impact that it has
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.660]   on your mental health and your ability to change course and reflect.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.660]   And literally, I would come into the year, every year I'd say I was going to do it.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.540]   I would set up this like complex journaling process with get these fancy notebooks and
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.900]   these pens and all this stuff, because that's just how I'm wired.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.500]   And you know, set aside 30 minutes a night to sit down and reflect and do all this stuff.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.780]   And without fail, five days in, I would miss a day and then the whole thing would get derailed
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.620]   and I wouldn't journal for the rest of the year.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.160]   And so I finally made progress and figured out a system that works by just simplifying
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.800]   it to like a two minute process where I just do, I call it my one, one, one method.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.780]   And it's one win from the day.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:44.180]   So one thing that went well, that you did well, one point of tension, anxiety, stress,
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.860]   like one thing that's just on your chest that you need to get off and get down on paper.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.500]   And then one point of gratitude.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.940]   So one thing that you just, it can be as tiny as like a smell that you really enjoy during
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.140]   the day, or it can be huge, you know, health of your family, whatever it might be.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.420]   But writing those three points down every single night, it has just been this enormous
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.820]   unlock for my life.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.980]   And it's so simple that literally anyone can do it and you don't have an excuse not to,
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.020]   because it can take one minute to go and sit down and write it.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:17.100]   And if you are struggling on one of those three things, do you sit there and think it
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.700]   out or do you just skip it?
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.500]   Or what advice would you give to someone who's like, "God, I just can't think of something."
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:28.220]   I try to do it from like complete word dump mindset.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.100]   Like I don't want to overthink it too much.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.500]   I want to just do the first thing that comes to my mind, the first win that I can think
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   of from the day.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.740]   It can be as simple as like, "I got up at the time I said I was going to get up."
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.700]   Because it just gives you like a nice pat on the back where if you feel like you lost
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.340]   the day, like you feel like you had a tough day, that first win that comes to your mind
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.060]   and you can write it down, it's so impactful.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.780]   And everyone has the tension or stress.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.580]   No one is ever going to be without one of those from a given day.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.820]   You always had something.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:41:00.220]   So it tends to be like either the win or the point of gratitude is tougher.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.020]   The win is usually the hardest for people.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.700]   And so it's just like minimize what you think, like open up the aperture of what qualifies
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.980]   as a win in your life, if you will.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.620]   Everyone thinks it has to be some amazing big thing, but it can be as tiny as, "I just
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:17.060]   I got up out of bed when I thought I took a shower, you know, in the way that I wanted
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.060]   to."
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.660]   Like the smallest little thing can count as a win in your life.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:25.100]   Last night, I had an apple instead of dessert.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.100]   And for anyone listening...
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.100]   Hell, it's God.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.100]   Yeah, I know.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.100]   That's how I felt.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.820]   It's that meme where you're like, "Ah, I felt like a hero."
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:36.700]   And I recorded an episode yesterday with Jordan Schlane, who's a doctor and he's awesome.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.700]   And we talked a lot about this.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.340]   So I think that episode will have already come out by the time people hear this.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.420]   So you'll know why I was so excited about eating an apple.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.860]   But that would have been my win if I had written that down.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   It's a great one.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   Do you write it digitally or do you write it with a pen?
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.140]   I write with pen and paper.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.900]   I just find the process of actually writing on paper to be pretty therapeutic.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.220]   I have terrible penmanship.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.260]   I need to get much better about that.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.760]   When I tweeted this whole method out, I tweeted a picture of my journal and got dunked on
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.020]   by a bunch of people for how bad my handwriting is.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.340]   But such is life.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.220]   That's one thing to take into 2023.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.780]   But I know you wrote a post that I really liked or a newsletter, right?
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.620]   You've been very good at "Here's my content.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.680]   If you want to consume it on Twitter, you can consume it here.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.700]   You want to consume it on Instagram, you can consume it here.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.260]   Or you can subscribe to the newsletter, which I do."
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.380]   And one was about 23 things to take into 2023.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.180]   So I thought we would wrap this up and go through highlights.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.800]   We'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.540]   Subscribe to the newsletter for sure.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.220]   But just a few of these things since you broke them down into categories, what do you think?
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.220]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.220]   All right.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.220]   So your first category was work.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.620]   Well, the first one connects directly to the annual review.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.800]   So I think it's a great one to start on because it'll help people as they think about this
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   coming year.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.740]   I call this my energy calendar technique.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.780]   And as it sounds like something from like Sedona, Arizona with crystals in the room,
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.740]   you got the vortex, the Sedona vortex.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.740]   I love that.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.660]   Sedona is amazing, by the way.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.580]   Everyone should go there at some point in their life.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:04.740]   The energy calendar technique is basically a simple color coding strategy to figure out
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.540]   over the course of a week or two, what it is in your life that's creating energy and
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.780]   what's draining energy.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:14.780]   So the way I do it is take a week when you're going to do this, go through a workday at
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.780]   the end of the day, look at your calendar and make changes to the color of the things
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.920]   on your calendar based on what created energy, what was sort of neutral and what drained
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.660]   energy from you and literally go change the color of those things on the day that just
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.660]   passed.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.320]   So if something created energy, you mark it as green.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.300]   If it was neutral, you mark it as yellow.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.560]   And if it drained energy, you mark it as red.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.580]   Do that every single day for a week, maybe two weeks, and then go back and look at it.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:45.820]   And you'll immediately be able to viscerally very clearly identify trends in what created
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:51.100]   energy in your life, which you need to amplify and try to spend more time on what was neutral,
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.160]   which you can kind of continue to leave or potentially try to delegate.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.840]   And then what was draining energy from your life.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.940]   And with those, the whole idea is to start slowly working your way towards being able
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.420]   to delegate or delete those from your life.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.580]   Yeah, the one thing that I'm going to try with this is there's times, especially when
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.900]   you're working on your own schedule like I am where I'll be doing something, but I didn't
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.060]   put it in my calendar.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.780]   I'm not as good as others at time blocking the whole perfect day.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.900]   But at the end of the day, it'd be really easy for me to be like, "Oh, for this hour,
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.540]   I researched this topic."
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.740]   So if you do it at the end of the day, it could be really quick.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.980]   So I'm going to go in back and also add other things because...
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.020]   I'm also bad, by the way, at time boxing.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:36.580]   I think time boxing is near a all who is amazing and I think it's a great technique for a lot
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.580]   of people.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.380]   I really struggle with having every minute of my calendar filled just optically.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.820]   It intimidates me about the day.
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.820]   Even if a block literally says, "Go on a walk with your son," it's intimidating to me to
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.260]   see at the beginning of the day every minute filled.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.100]   So I have huge open blocks.
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.860]   So I actually do exactly what you just said.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.940]   I'll go back and say like, "Oh, I did this piece of research here.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.300]   I did this here," etc.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.860]   Well, speaking of walks, let's talk about taking breaks because I know that was in there
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:02.860]   number four.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.740]   I mean, this is all about attention residue, which is a concept that I think one of your
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:11.340]   prior guests, Cal Newport, has written about in the past that I've become somewhat obsessed
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.340]   with.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:17.260]   Generally, just this idea that we're always context switching because of the world that
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.460]   we live in with constant notifications.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.660]   So you'll be working on something and then you decide to check your email.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:28.500]   And when you check your email, there's this tiny cognitive load that is now stuck in that
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.900]   email when you come back to the work.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.340]   And you're just getting spread thin.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.820]   You're literally just like leaving your kind of mental capacity in all of these different
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.020]   places in your messages, in your emails, etc.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:42.580]   And so then when you're going back and working on the really important thing, you're operating
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.020]   at like 60% of what your optimal mental capacity is.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.560]   And obviously, as a result, your work is going to suffer.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.620]   So this whole idea is we need to minimize the impact of attention residue.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:58.500]   Attention residue is that actual scientific side of that when that happens and your attention
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.780]   is grabbed in different places.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.580]   And taking breaks is really a key way to get around this.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:09.640]   And so the biggest way that I think most people can put this into their schedule and into
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.140]   their lives is schedule 25-minute meetings instead of 30-minute meetings.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.360]   And immediately, you'll see a difference.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.760]   Rather than having the context switch that comes from having back-to-back meetings that
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.160]   are just pushing you from one thing to the next, when your mind is still in the prior
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.000]   meeting while you're in the new one, or your mind's on the next meeting while you're in
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.800]   this one, you create an actual separation window.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.120]   You can go for a quick walk.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   You can sit and just breathe.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.720]   It has a massive impact immediately.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   And by the way, if anyone doesn't know this, it's a setting in Google Calendar to turn
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.840]   on speedy meetings, which takes 30-minute meetings, makes them 25, takes hour meetings,
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.920]   and makes them 50 minutes.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   So you don't even have to work hard to do it.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.380]   You could just enable the feature.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.880]   And then when you drag an hour-long meeting, it auto readjusts to 50 minutes.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.880]   That's a great hack.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   I love that.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:03.640]   And then I think this pairs well with your number seven about batching email into Windows
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   to process.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:11.480]   Yeah, this one has been a huge, huge push for me personally, which is I just found myself
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.200]   constantly checking emails and texts throughout the entire day.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.040]   And so when I started really focusing on minimizing attention residue, I thought about what's
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.680]   the best way for me to minimize the impact that that has.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.920]   And what I did was I just set a one-hour block late in the day, which was when I was going
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.600]   to actually check email.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.600]   And initially, I definitely wasn't perfect about it.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.320]   I'm still not 100% compliant.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.920]   I will still pop it open because I have the finance gene in me where I feel like I need
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.020]   to be on email 24/7.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.880]   But having a window of discrete time when you're actually going to process those emails
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.880]   allows you to minimize how it impacts the other parts of your day.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.720]   And then also, you really focus on the emails and you think clearly about the things and
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.400]   the questions people are asking when you're working on them because that becomes the core
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.920]   thing that you're doing during that time, rather than it being just a little distraction
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.240]   and you're trying to process it as quickly as you can between meetings.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.680]   So that one's really impactful.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.800]   It just depends on what your career track is and what you're working on to think about
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.880]   how many of those windows there need to be, how long they have to be.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.040]   If you work in professional services, if you're a lawyer, if you're an investment banker,
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.600]   if you're a consultant, it's rich for you to think that you can have a one-hour window
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   when you're doing email.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   It's ridiculous.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   I worked in finance.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   You can't do that.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.800]   Now, can you have three of those windows during the day and get away with it?
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   Probably.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.920]   You could probably have one early in the day, one around lunchtime, and one in the evening
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.160]   and be in a good spot where you're still getting those periods of deep work when you can really
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.340]   think about things.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:42.000]   But then you also have those fixed times where you're processing and moving through stuff.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.600]   So I think there's a happy medium for everyone to find that'll really optimize this.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.500]   And I don't know the science behind this, but my gut would say that part of the reason
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.760]   we love checking our emails is because every time something comes in, it's like someone's
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.840]   wanting to talk to you.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.160]   There's this dopamine hit of seeing this thing.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.640]   I can say that when you start batching your emails, you just increase the likelihood that
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.200]   some interesting thing is going to be there every single time you check your email.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.760]   So at the end of this recording, I'm going to go check my email and I'm going to be excited
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.360]   because I know that there's actually something interesting.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:19.440]   Whereas, when you're in the habit of checking your email all the time, 90% of those times,
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.300]   it's just some stupid spam thing.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.120]   It's something unimportant.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.800]   But now, when I batch my emails, every time I check my email, if it's only two or three
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.400]   times a day, there's usually something valuable and interesting in there.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   So I don't know.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.680]   I actually get a lot of satisfaction when I've gone without email for a little while.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.640]   I get that dopamine hit of like, "Oh, there's one great thing every time."
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   You're a really positive guy.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   I like this about you.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   That's great.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.880]   I'm a dread email guy.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.320]   I'm trying to avoid the stressful thing that's coming into my inbox.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320]   Oh, no.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   I'm excited.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   The most exciting thing could be here.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.880]   And by the way, doing the same thing with messages has been a great change for me with
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.060]   text messages because it's the same exact impact and you're checking text throughout
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.060]   the day.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.860]   My goal for 2023 is to try to do this with social media because popping open Twitter
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.920]   once an hour and looking at things and doom scrolling and seeing what notifications or
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.380]   who's yelling at you or sending you mean DMs, just like super, super counterproductive for
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.380]   deep work.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:20.740]   Yeah, for Twitter, one thing I've done is just relentlessly unfollow.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.740]   Or even...
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.420]   You don't even have to unfollow, but I think you can mute a person.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.660]   So you can still DM them, but you don't have to see their tweets.
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.900]   To the point that there's just not that many people in your feed.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:34.460]   So your feed is something you can manage and actually maybe complete in the day.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.220]   Did you turn to the latest tweet setting or are you still on?
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:42.060]   Because now that they've changed the algorithm, the home feed is pretty...
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.820]   It's tons of stuff of people you don't follow.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:50.420]   I still use Tweetbot because I don't like that in the Twitter app and I don't like seeing
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.420]   sponsored tweets.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.420]   I could just...
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.620]   So I still use Tweetbot as my main Twitter app.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.100]   And there are reasons it sucks.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.820]   It's delayed on getting notifications from DMs.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.380]   But throughout this conversation, I'm wondering if maybe that's a good thing.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:09.140]   So I would love to see the Twitter app be something that I could use more regularly,
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.620]   but I don't use it much right now.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:14.340]   The hack here is just to turn...
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.820]   You go to the little star icon in the top right of your Twitter thing and just change
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.500]   it to latest tweets rather than doing the home.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:26.380]   And it means that it just does it in chronological order and it's basically only people you follow.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.660]   And so that cleans up your feed immediately.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.020]   You don't have all the stuff that Twitter is serving up to you.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.020]   I don't think it's...
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.500]   Does it sync between platforms?
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.900]   No, it doesn't.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.900]   Because I had that...
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:41.540]   I literally just checked this because I had my Mac OS Twitter app was on latest, but my
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.020]   phone is somehow not.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.660]   So I'm now going to go fix that.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.660]   So yeah.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.060]   Tweetbot for me, it's like...
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.700]   Since I only follow a handful of people and they're like news sources and people...
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.700]   I can just like...
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.220]   I go on my computer and it's like there are 12 unread tweets.
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:56.220]   I just roll up.
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.480]   And then when I go to my phone, it jumps right to that same spot in the feed.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.940]   But hopefully, Twitter can get their act together.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.300]   The one thing I'll add to this...
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:09.500]   So I guess by the end of this, it might be 26 things or 27 things to take into 2023,
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.100]   is from my reflections, which is just learn to outsource tasks to increase the ROI of
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.100]   your time.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:19.740]   And I will say, depending on what industry you work in, this may or may not be allowed.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.020]   So check with your company.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.660]   If you work for yourself, you have a lot more flexibility.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:27.740]   But there are certainly tasks during the day that I'm sure someone else could do and give
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:33.140]   you more time to spend on the things that are the most high ROI for your time.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.900]   And especially if your company would support you, maybe hiring a virtual assistant to help
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.180]   do some of these things.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.900]   I've seen a handful of examples of people, especially in sales, where they were able
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.260]   to hire people.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.940]   Their company wasn't going to give them the budget.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:50.340]   So they just personally freelance hired people and convinced the company that they should
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.100]   have the budget to bring this person on so that they could spend their time closing the
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.500]   deals and drive up the actual output they got.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.020]   Their salary went up, even net of what they had to pay out.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:07.760]   So I think there are a lot of opportunities to outsource, to optimize where you spend
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   your time.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   Alright.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   Health?
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   Health.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   Alright.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.420]   Well, there's a couple in here that are my go-to.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:21.100]   So the first one is something that I started doing in college, which I guess I will loosely
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.940]   call the 55530 method.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.500]   And the reason I will loosely call it that is because someone else called it that.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.340]   I put it in this like life hacks document that I did maybe six months ago.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:36.220]   And then someone wrote a Twitter thread on it without citing me actually, because they
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.180]   thought that it was like a well-known method.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:42.940]   And it was literally just something that I created and started doing in college that
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.940]   no one knows about.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.780]   So it's pretty funny to me that it now has a name.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.540]   But basically this is as soon as you wake up and get out of bed, you do five squats,
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:57.180]   five lunges per leg, five pushups, and a 30 second plank.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:02.420]   And all this does is just immediately sparks your energy and metabolism to start the day.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.140]   It's like a simple thing, right?
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.140]   Five pushups.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.140]   It's not like you're saying, "Oh, I'm going to do a hundred pushups as soon as I get out
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.420]   of bed."
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.220]   It's a low enough amount that it's not intimidating and you can force yourself to just quickly
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.340]   do it to start the day.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.300]   You can do it while your coffee is getting made or literally right as soon as you get
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.520]   out of bed.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.500]   But it gives you this huge energy boost to start the day.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.820]   And I think it's hugely impactful.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:26.260]   I started doing it because we had these early morning baseball practices in college.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.120]   And it's just a habit that's now stuck with me throughout my life.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.500]   What else do you do in the morning?
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.500]   I'm curious.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.980]   I think there are a few things in your health list that are morning routine.
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.980]   I get out of bed.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.700]   I drink a whole bunch.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.820]   I keep a cold water on my bedside table.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.380]   So as soon as I wake up, I drink a whole ton of water.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:48.380]   I do the 5-5-5-30 really quickly, just like on the floor on the side, trying to stay quiet
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.340]   because I wake up earlier than my wife.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.380]   And then I go get in a cold plunge.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.380]   So this has been...
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   This is a new ad.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.980]   I got the cold plunge in July of 2022 and have done every single day since, three to
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.220]   seven minutes in it every morning at 39 degrees.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:11.740]   And that's been probably the biggest impact in my life of a single thing that I've added
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.060]   to my routine in the last five or 10 years.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:20.500]   I've experienced just a massive set of benefits in terms of energy and in terms of the dopamine
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.860]   rush that I get from it, the surge that just lasts for hours, that just makes me feel super
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.740]   human during the early part of my day.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.740]   So that's been the big, big ad for me.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:34.380]   We've just created a space in our home where a cold plunge will one day go.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:39.380]   I don't know enough of the science to say like the brown fat and the metabolism and
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.380]   the immunity.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.380]   And there's all this research.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.820]   Dr. Huberman has talked about it, I think, on an episode that shows all of these great
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.980]   health benefits.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:52.260]   But if nothing else other than the dopamine rush and the feeling of doing something hard
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.380]   that makes the rest of the day feel easier, it would be worth it to me.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.980]   I've absolutely loved it.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.580]   I think it's phenomenal.
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.580]   Anything else you do in the morning?
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.380]   I mean, this is with my son now, which is even better on all of this.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:09.420]   But waking up in the morning, doing those things, and then just going out and getting
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.420]   sunlight.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.460]   Again, this goes back to a thing that Dr. Huberman has talked about a lot, the impact
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.740]   of getting sun first thing in the morning.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:20.540]   And that can be on a cloudy day, you just have to stay out longer, there still is sun.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:25.500]   But having that, just being able to breathe, not having your phone on you so that you're
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:30.900]   not looking and checking messages, checking email, checking social media, et cetera, is
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.940]   a great, great way to start your day, set your body in the right direction, it improves
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.300]   your mood, it improves your sleep the next night, a whole host of health benefits.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:44.040]   But for me personally, just from a cognitive standpoint, to start my day with a feeling
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:49.220]   of breathing and creativity has been a great, great habit.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.900]   I'm going to add a couple, I'll do them quick, because they're actually four.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.740]   And most of them came from this conversation I had about health a couple weeks ago.
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.860]   Technically, I had a day ago, but by the time you're listening to this, it'll be a couple
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.940]   weeks ago.
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.840]   So one, we talked about how one of the most valuable things you could do is just time
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.100]   restricted eating.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:10.820]   So you call it intermittent fasting, you can call it whatever you want, but just keeping
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.180]   your eating window to a smaller time.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:18.540]   That's something that I think I had done for a while, took a pause in the holidays, and
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.960]   hopefully will bring back this year.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.540]   Another is we talked about Jordan, who I spoke with was like one of his kind of diagnostic
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.560]   things is going through who are you and just collecting the basic data and diagnostics
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.300]   about your health.
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:36.300]   So I'm gonna encourage a lot of people who haven't done this to consider it, which is
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:42.420]   just like, go check your basic, get your basic metabolic panel, like your blood work done.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:46.740]   I know a lot of us when we're young, we're like, "Oh, you know, everything seems fine."
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.500]   But try to figure out is there an area you need to work on.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.100]   For me, it was cholesterol.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.540]   That's my area right now.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.820]   But for everyone else, it could be different.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:54.820]   So just doing that.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.420]   There are some great companies that can support that, by the way.
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.780]   I mean, you can look up the different ones.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:02.520]   I'm not affiliated with any, but I've used InsideTracker in the past.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:07.220]   It's relatively pricey, but it's an incredible experience and they have a great kind of dashboard
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.700]   that allows you to track it over time as well.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.320]   They are a partner of the show.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.820]   So everybody gets 20% off.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.660]   So bring that price down a little.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.280]   Another one he pointed out was stop using alarms.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.580]   And this will be an interesting one to hear your reaction to, because I know you wake
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.580]   up early.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.260]   And he said, switch from a wake up alarm to a bedtime alarm.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:30.660]   Once you learn how much sleep your body needs to naturally wake up, then instead of setting
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:34.980]   your alarm for 5am, which I think is something you do, figure out how much sleep you need
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.780]   and set your go to bed alarm.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:41.180]   Because there's just so much magic that happens while you're asleep, that interrupting that
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:44.740]   process can have an impact on your health.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.420]   And if you could force that to be different, that's better.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:52.020]   So I actually don't use an alarm in the morning because I've gotten pretty good at waking
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.280]   up naturally around the same time, as long as I go to bed at the right time.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.280]   That's an interesting one.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.620]   I've always just loved alarms.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.340]   I'm not trying to take it away.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:02.340]   Just switch.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.020]   I originally needed them because I just wasn't sleeping enough and so I just needed to get
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.020]   up early.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:10.100]   When I was working in finance in my early days, I was getting up at like 3.45, going
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.580]   to bed probably by 10.30.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.940]   I just wasn't sleeping enough for like a period of six years.
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.820]   I've recently, over the last year and a half, started taking sleep very seriously.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.540]   And now I just have a grandpa schedule, man.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:25.380]   I'm asleep by 8.30 and I'm up by between 4 and 5, depending on the day.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.940]   And I get my seven to eight hours and I feel great and I wake up and I don't have an issue
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.940]   with it.
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.780]   But maybe I should experiment with it.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.500]   And then the last was along the lines of that apple, which is I'm going to really try in
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.020]   2023 to...
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:42.460]   I had this negative impression of fruit my whole last few years.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.660]   I was like, "Well, fruit has sugar.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:47.620]   If fruit is sugar, it can't be good for you.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.600]   If I'm going to have sugar, why not eat a cookie?"
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.500]   My wife has told me that was crazy forever.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.420]   And we finally dug into the science behind it.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:57.940]   And it's like, fruit is actually pretty good.
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.220]   There are some fruits that are not as good as others.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:06.240]   I think mango, especially when it's dried or in juice form, is maybe more like a soft
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.860]   drink than something.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:14.300]   But I'm going to try as part of this cholesterol plan to replace dessert with fruit and dark
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.300]   chocolate.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.620]   I think it's a great approach, by the way, for limiting calories.
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.700]   You get the sweetness hit, but you don't have the negative impact.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.700]   So I love that one.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.700]   That's a great ad.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.700]   And the amount of fiber in an apple, you just can't have five apples.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.300]   I can tell everyone listening from experience, you can have five cookies.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.860]   It is a physically possible thing.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.220]   I don't think I could eat five apples.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.580]   No, you definitely couldn't.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.620]   And by the way, this all goes to one of my health hacks, which is to just do all of your
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.660]   shopping on the outer perimeter of the grocery store.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.980]   If you just do that, you will immediately get healthier, lose weight, be in better shape,
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.980]   etc.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.940]   Because all of the good stuff is on the outer aisles and all the bad stuff is on the inner
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:51.940]   aisles.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:59.260]   Fun, fun, financial, psychological money hack that I learned in an episode a long time ago
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:04.980]   is that if you walk the grocery store in the reverse order, on average, people save...
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.100]   I can't remember the percent.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.500]   Some percent of the...
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.340]   They spend less.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.620]   Because the grocery store is just like...
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.140]   You think it's like, "Oh, they managed to put this thing on this aisle."
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.140]   It's like, "No."
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.820]   They very meticulously engineered every aspect of your grocery store for you to spend the
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.700]   most amount of money possible.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:26.180]   And just by going to the back and working your way around the other way, you will avoid
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:32.180]   certain marketing things, certain various elements that are trying to get you to spend.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.180]   It's like Ikea, man.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:37.700]   Ikea has that maze that you have to go through at the end that is so perfectly engineered
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.020]   to make you buy shit you don't need.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   I know.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.340]   Sometimes you're like, "I'm trying to run.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.340]   Look at what..."
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.940]   I remember one time we were like, "We just need to find an accent chair."
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:51.500]   And I was like, "It is so hard to get to anywhere in Ikea without following the map."
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.940]   There's a couple of hidden doors where you're like, "Can I go through this?
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.940]   I just need a chair."
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.620]   But yeah.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.060]   So that's health, which is something I think we're going to do a few more...
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.260]   Jordan and I actually talked about doing some follow-up episodes.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.740]   So I want to get more serious on that this year.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.900]   I'm excited for Peter Attia's book, Outlive, coming out later this year.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.540]   Alright, let's talk about personal before we wrap and money.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.820]   Again, going back to one of your prior guests, Cal Newport.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.100]   I think this is back in college.
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.260]   I first read this from him.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.940]   He had a blog piece about a shutdown ritual or something like that.
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.740]   I call it a power down ritual, but basically creating a very fixed separation between your
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:31.220]   professional life and your personal life is something that you can do that immediately
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.880]   improves your mental health and has definitely had an impact on my life.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.740]   This is like establishing a sequence of events that you do at the end of your day that mentally
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.840]   and literally marks the end of your workday.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.900]   So it might be like checking messages for the last time and firing off any last emails
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:53.300]   that you need to set, might be doing the little bit of prep for your next morning's work to
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.780]   kind of set yourself up to hit the ground running, it might be checking Slack, whatever
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.740]   it is, you kind of do this one set sequence of a couple of events.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:06.980]   And then in Cal's original blog piece, he actually advocated saying something out loud,
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:12.980]   like having kind of like a nerdy, actual shutdown sequence initiated thing that triggers in
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:15.060]   your mind that the day is over.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.100]   And the whole goal is that once you do this shutdown sequence, you're off, you're not
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.780]   checking email, you're not going and looking at things.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:23.780]   That's it for the day.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.220]   And it's just a really, really helpful practice, especially in this hybrid and remote work
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:32.660]   world that we're living in where it's so easy to let professional and personal blur.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.180]   I don't have a ritual yet, but I've started to get and I think people learn this when
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.180]   you have kids.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.880]   It's like you want to have your quality family time because you're working during the day.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.760]   You kind of have to do this, but I don't have a ritual and I feel like I'm going to bring
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.140]   that one into this year.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.660]   Two more for you really quick on the personal side.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:53.220]   If you're in a relationship, tell your partner one thing you appreciate about them every
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.820]   single night.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.220]   And this can be the tiniest thing.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.460]   It can be like, I appreciate how you picked up that one thing or how you let me know about
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.940]   X, Y, or Z.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:06.540]   Just tell them one small thing because as relationships go on, it's really easy to just
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:11.660]   not think about all the good and to just have the stressful or the tension or the anxiety
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.180]   be the things that you hold in your mind.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:19.380]   And doing this every night has had a really, really positive impact on my wife and my relationship.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.260]   And then the last one, take yourself out for more meals alone.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:29.380]   I do this once a month without fail, either a lunch or a dinner dinner, preferably, although
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.400]   it probably doesn't happen quite as often now with the little guy.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.660]   But just go out to a restaurant by yourself.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.700]   It can be your favorite place or it can be a new place.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:41.280]   Don't bring any technology or just keep it in your pocket, put it on airplane mode.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   You can bring a book.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.620]   You can bring a notebook if you want to journal and write things, but just sit by yourself
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:52.400]   and allow yourself to be bored and just observe the world around you and have a nice meal
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   by yourself.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.980]   Huge, huge unlock that not enough people are doing.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.380]   I'll share one that's similar for people with family.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:05.580]   And if the theme of yours was you don't always have to eat with your partner or with
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.140]   someone else, you can eat by yourself.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:11.460]   Mine is you don't always have to spend all of your family time with all of your family.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.260]   And so you you mentioned you take walks with your son.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:17.820]   I think that it's important to have quality time as a family.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.060]   And it's also important to have quality time with people in your family together without
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.140]   everyone else.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.380]   So that's for us.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.660]   I would say encourage people to find a way to get childcare, to go on a date, even if
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:33.060]   it's a lunch date while you have, you know, in the middle of the day or dinner or something.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.780]   And then also with your kids alone, like I take my daughter on an adventure.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.060]   So my wife and I are talking about what we want to do with our family in the future and
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:47.160]   taking a trip with each kid, you know, without the other kid is something we want to do.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.620]   And spending time with, you know, one on lots of different like one on one stuff is also
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.620]   really important.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.700]   So that's one that I want to take into 2023.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.440]   Alright, last section is money.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.700]   I just had three in there.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.260]   We can hit them rapid fire.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:04.120]   First one is automate a direct deposit into an investment account that you basically never
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.980]   look at.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980]   Everyone should do this.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.300]   This is just like an absolute financial no brainer.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.980]   Allow the money to just compound.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.380]   Don't think about how much money is in it.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:17.700]   Just set some low number that feels not super stressful to you that automatically goes out
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.060]   in a direct deposit into this investment account every single month.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.100]   Let compounding work for you.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.140]   Number two, automate all the simple financial tasks in your life.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.360]   I used to be a type of person that would just check all of my different bills and look at
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.620]   all the numbers and pay them all manually because I figured someone was going to be
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.220]   trying to screw me over.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.340]   It never once happened, and I was just wasting a whole bunch of mental energy by going and
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.740]   looking at these things every month.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:47.500]   So automating all of your bill payment, credit cards, investing, etc.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:53.980]   Anything that's pulling your mind away from things that really matter is easily automatable.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:59.780]   And then the last one for me is this rule I have around material purchases, which is
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.080]   a way to save money and build wealth.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.460]   Like a 48-hour rule about material purchases, which means if you put something in a shopping
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.880]   cart, walk away, and 48 hours later, come back.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:14.620]   If you still want the thing, buy it, and there's no issue with that.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.800]   But most of the time, you're going to realize that the material purchase that you'd put
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.560]   in your shopping cart 48 hours later, you've thought about it, and you don't go buy.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.080]   So it's a behavioral hack for avoiding the unnecessary purchases that we don't really
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.080]   need.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.920]   And if you can invest that money instead, even better.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.000]   I like it.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.180]   I do both the first thing and the second thing.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.800]   So I love all the automation.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.680]   I'm not as diligent about putting in your shopping cart.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.360]   But I will add mine, which is everyone knows that's listening to this show that has in
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.360]   the past.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.120]   When you're about to check out, it's like, "Go find all the ways you can save money for
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.120]   it."
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.840]   Ask LiveChat for the discount, use Rakuten or some other platform to get cash back.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.640]   See if you could buy gift cards at a discount.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.640]   Use the right card.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.300]   Obviously, we're all doing those things.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.960]   The other 3 ones I'll give are...
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   Especially on miso soup.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.500]   Yeah, you gotta save money on that $4.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.100]   So I'm going to add 2 others.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:11.260]   One is if you're not already tracking and organizing something in an automated way,
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.260]   do that.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.860]   So I have 2 or 3 primary platforms for this.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.600]   So I worked at Wealththread for a while.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   People know that.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.540]   They have a free way that you can link all of your accounts, see your net worth all in
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.100]   one place.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:27.820]   I also use a product called Kubera, which is I would say like, if you want the free
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.400]   version, Wealththread does a great job.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.380]   If you want the full bells and whistles pro version, I think Kubera is best in class.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.300]   It tracks all of your accounts across all places.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:44.980]   It works well with everything from manual assets to crypto to real estate and everything.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.160]   And so I think it's a great product.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.220]   And I use Trustworthy for managing all of life's stuff.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:59.060]   So where are our old tax returns, where are all of our COVID vaccine cards, our social
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.060]   security cards.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.700]   I put all of our life stuff there.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.900]   They've built like the family operating system.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.340]   There is a price.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.360]   But when you just think about the overhead you have of trying to manage and find and
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.300]   store all of this stuff, it's just not worth it for me.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:19.300]   So those are 2 things to just set up some organization for where's your money, what's
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.100]   your net worth, where are all your accounts, all that.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:27.460]   And then the other is for 2023, I'd encourage everyone to knock off...
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:32.200]   This is mostly for people with kids, but knock off the 2 big tasks that every single parent
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:38.360]   I know punts on, which is setting up a will or a trust or something like that, and setting
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360]   up life insurance.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.060]   If those 2 things are things that have been bogging you down, go get them done in 2023
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:50.140]   because they're just so, so, so important.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.380]   That's my recommendation for 2 things on the money side to bring into the year.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.640]   I need to check out Kubera.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.640]   This sounds really interesting.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.940]   I've always looked for something like this.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.220]   I'm going to go check it out.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.220]   I think they...
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220]   Look, Wealthfront is...
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.220]   It's also...
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.220]   By the way, is it an Indian company?
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.140]   Because I think it's derived from the God of Wealth.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.700]   The founder, I believe, has a background...
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.900]   Family is from India or is from India.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900]   I don't remember.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900]   Okay, cool.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.900]   Yeah, it's a great name because it's...
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.900]   Yeah, it's the God of Wealth.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:20.900]   It's awesome.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   And I think by the time this episode comes out, they will be a partner of the show and
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.220]   we'll have a discount for you.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.460]   If not, go to allthehacks.com/deals and it should be there.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.460]   That's it.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.460]   I mean, the funny thing about...
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.460]   We covered a lot.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   You say, "That's it."
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.460]   Oh, man.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.900]   I think that's it for now, actually, because you've written all these amazing posts.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.500]   One on razors, paradoxes, and I was like, "We should go through all this."
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.540]   And I was trying to plan for this episode, and I'm really glad we didn't try to fit
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.540]   all that in here.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.540]   Oh, man.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.180]   Because it would have just been one of those run through everything, no depth, no value.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.980]   So I think we got to have you back on and we can run through a few of the other things
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.820]   you've written about that I think would be really valuable to talk through.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.100]   I would love to do it, man.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   This was a blast.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.780]   It was really fun getting to actually talk through this live.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   I haven't gotten to do this.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.140]   So I'm excited to get everyone's feedback and hopefully, people come away with a few
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.580]   things that changed their life this year.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:11.340]   One thing that I like to ask everyone, which I paused in the last interview, I don't know
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:16.500]   why I forgot, was is there a place, whether it's where you're from, where you travel a
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.660]   lot that you know a lot about that if you were sending or if someone were going to for
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:24.420]   a day, you'd tell them, "Here's a place to eat, here's a place to have a drink, or here's
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.180]   some something unique to do?"
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.180]   Yes.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:31.220]   So in Bangalore, India, which is where my mother's from, that I've spent a ton of time
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:37.220]   in over the years, there is an amazing restaurant at this pretty old hotel, which is now called
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.700]   ITC Windsor.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:45.140]   The restaurant is called the Royal Afghan, and it is my favorite meal in the entire world.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:51.100]   The best naan that I've ever, ever had, and they have a dish called Dal Bukhara that is
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.540]   unbelievable.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.020]   So that would be mine, the Royal Afghan in Bangalore, India.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.020]   Anything else you'd say?
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.140]   If someone's going all the way to India, they're going to the Royal Afghan, how should they
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.780]   spend the rest of their day?
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.820]   Just take in the culture.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:07.540]   If you've never been to India, it is an unbelievable and very, very different experience.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.900]   The smell will last with you forever.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.620]   It is a very distinct smell when you get off the plane in India.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:17.100]   Well, I'll add one extra Bangalore recommendation, which is not actually in Bangalore, but if
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.300]   you like to rock climb, hop on the train, which is a whole nother experience, and head
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:27.980]   to Hampi, which is a really cool place for like a ridiculous amount of outdoor bouldering.
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:28.980]   I haven't done that yet.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.740]   I'm going at the end of this month, though, so maybe I'll have to go do that.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.740]   Are you?
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.740]   Do rock climbing?
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.740]   Do rock bouldering?
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.740]   No.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.920]   So it's like a backpackery rock climbing town.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.980]   Like that is what the town is known for, at least for tourism.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.980]   I think I'm going to pass on this.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.940]   I'm just going to stick to doing the commercial stuff.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.980]   You can have a lot of fun in Bangalore.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.840]   We had a great time.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   But awesome.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.840]   All right.
