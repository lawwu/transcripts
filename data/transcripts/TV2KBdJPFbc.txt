[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Well, if you are unhappy with your prayer life, you join a lot of us.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.280]   You have company.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.800]   And Pastor John has a word for all of us.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.640]   On December 28th, 2008, he preached a sermon on prayer titled "Put in the Fire for the
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.660]   Sake of Prayer."
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.940]   In that sermon, he lamented the pervasiveness of prayerlessness among Christians, and that's
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.240]   a complaint of many Christians, even those in his own church, as you're going to hear
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.640]   him talk about in just a moment.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   So how do we kickstart this essential discipline in our lives in order to exercise our faith?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.560]   He offers us three practical suggestions.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.600]   Here now is Pastor John Witham.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.080]   Let me give you a few practical suggestions.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.480]   These are growing out of my life and out of my reading of the Bible.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.600]   Just three brief practical suggestions, because we're not doing as well as we should.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.640]   Now, suggestion number one, set aside a time and a place each day and don't leave it to
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.480]   chance.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.240]   Set aside a time and a place each day and don't leave it to chance.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.680]   The devil defeats most praying before it happens, because we didn't make a plan.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.960]   If you don't plan, believe me.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.440]   Oh, I have been at this a long time, and the devil hates me and my prayer life like you
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.040]   wouldn't believe how many good things keep me from praying.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   Not sin.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.720]   Sin does not keep me from praying.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.240]   Righteousness keeps me from praying.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   Answering holy emails and other holy things.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.040]   Just checking out one more piece of relevant news to pray about at whatever news service
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   you click on.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.200]   It's not evil that keeps us from praying.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.440]   It's good things, and he is shrewd to the bottom.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.760]   So pick a place and pick a time and show up.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:13.040]   Number two, I suggest that you combine your praying with reading the Bible and that you
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.400]   take what you read in the Bible and you turn it into prayer.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.720]   Because your brain, if it's a typical human brain, will have a very hard time holding
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.200]   a train of thought while you pray with no help from the Bible.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.440]   Try it for just ten minutes without your brain flipping out onto the dust you see on the
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.920]   Venetian blots.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.880]   It needs to be dusted.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.040]   Wouldn't be sin to get up and dust it.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.440]   Would it?
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.880]   Use the Bible and turn the Bible into prayer.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.240]   Read pray, read pray, read pray, read pray as long as you want to or can.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   That's number two.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.880]   Number three, I suggest that you pray in concentric circles.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.600]   You can either pray from the outside in or the inside out.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.440]   And what I mean by concentric circles is I'm the most needy spiritual person I know.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.800]   At least I know my sins better than I know anybody else's.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.080]   So I pray about me a lot.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.480]   Have mercy upon me.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.800]   Convict me.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   Kill me.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   Change me.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.160]   Guard me.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.040]   Humble me.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.680]   Destroy those aspects of me.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.720]   I pray about me a lot because of how sinful I am.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.520]   And then you move out from me to my family.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.240]   Pray about Noel.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.440]   Pray about Talitha.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   All my sons, all my daughters-in-law, all my grandchildren.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   That's another circle.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.680]   Then I move out from there to the staff.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.240]   I can name the staff and the elders.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.660]   And then I move out to you, the church.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340]   And then I move out from there to the wider movement of Christ around the world, our missionaries
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.760]   and the whole global cause of Christ.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.360]   And then I move out from there to the political, historical arena of the world.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.760]   I generally don't pray about galaxies or anything like that, but my universe, as far as prayer
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.560]   goes, stops pretty much at the planet.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.760]   I don't pray for the devil or angels.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.200]   I don't see any reason for doing that in the Bible.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.640]   Or you could go the other direction.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.760]   Move from the outside in.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   Just whatever.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.640]   And every one of those concentric circles, if you wonder, "Why do you put God at the
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   middle?"
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.060]   It's because he's in every circle.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.240]   And the main point of every circle is, "Hallowed be thy name.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   Thy kingdom come.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.000]   Thy will be done."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.760]   And only then do you get to, "Give me some bread today."
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.880]   Three big, massive, "Your name, hallowed.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.640]   Your kingdom, arriving.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.400]   Your will on the planet, done.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.560]   The way it's done in heaven and in my life."
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.640]   Those are in every circle.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.920]   That's why he's not anywhere in the concentric circles.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.600]   So those are my three suggestions.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.440]   The hard truth is, we Christians don't do very well.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   We've done some surveys over the years at Bethlehem.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.360]   It's pretty sad when we do them.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   I don't like to do them.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.400]   I get discouraged.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.320]   We don't pray very much.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.640]   We pray at meals, maybe, unless we're still stuck at the adolescent stage that thinks
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.880]   good habits are legalism.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.640]   We may whisper prayers before a tough meeting that we're walking into.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.240]   We may throw him a kiss as we crawl into bed.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:46.000]   But we don't set aside significant, regular, daily, disciplined time to pray in those ways
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.080]   much.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.760]   And we don't think it's worth it to meet with others to pray, by and large.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.320]   And we wonder, "Why is my faith weak?
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.300]   Why is my hope feeble?
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.320]   Why is my passion for Christ small?"
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   And meanwhile, the devil is whispering in your ear, some of you, "The pastor's getting
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.820]   legalistic now.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.460]   He's moving into the legalistic phase of the sermon.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.920]   He's starting to use guilt now.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   He's getting the law out now."
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.160]   To which I say, "To hell with the devil and all of his destructive lies.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   Be free, Bethlehem."
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.600]   Is intentional, regular, disciplined, earnest, Christ-dependent, God-glorifying, joyful prayer
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.960]   a duty, a discipline?
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.080]   Do I go to prayer meetings Tuesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Friday morning, Saturday
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.360]   afternoon, Sunday morning, Tuesday mornings or Saturday morning?
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.520]   Do I do that because it's a duty out of discipline?
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.440]   You could call it that.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   It's a duty the way it's a duty for a scuba diver to put on his air tank before he goes
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.320]   underwater.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.400]   It's a duty the way pilots should listen to air traffic controllers.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.600]   It's a duty the way soldiers in combat should clean their rifles and load their guns.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.320]   It's a duty the way hungry people eat food.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.240]   It's a duty the way thirsty people drink water.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.640]   It's a duty the way a deaf man puts on his hearing aid.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.680]   It's a duty the way a diabetic takes his insulin.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.320]   It's a duty the way Pooh Bear looks for honey.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   It's a duty the way pirates look for gold.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.520]   So you call it duty if you want.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.560]   It is like that.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.920]   I hate the devil.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:06.560]   I hate the way he's killing some of you by persuading you it's legalistic to do regular,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.880]   set aside, disciplined praying.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.680]   I hate the devil and the way he's killing you.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.440]   He is laughing up his sleeve at how easy he can take out Christians.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.800]   The devil is.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.440]   He is laughing up his sleeve at what suckers we are.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.760]   For his worn out...
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.560]   This is legalism.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.280]   You should just look at him and say, "I'm older than that.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.960]   I'm not in fifth grade anymore.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.460]   I've grown up a little bit.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.440]   Get out of my life.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.240]   I've got work to do because I am a sinner in desperate need of talking to my king every
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.840]   day and my sin inclines me to leave it over and over.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.320]   If I don't set a time and a place, I'm a goner."
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.680]   Talk to the devil.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.800]   Give him some information.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.760]   He might leave you alone for a while.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.560]   Probably not.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.000]   Folks, if we don't eat, we starve.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.400]   If we don't drink, we die of thirst.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.720]   If we don't exercise a muscle, it atrophies.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.680]   If we don't breathe, we suffocate.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.440]   And just as there are physical means of life, there are spiritual means of grace.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   It's so simple.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.320]   Such a powerful excerpt taken from John Piper's sermon on December 28th, 2008.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.360]   That sermon is titled, "Put in the Fire for the Sake of Prayer."
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.760]   And you can find the whole thing at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.400]   Whether you listen in the car, at the gym, or doing chores, thank you for having us along.

[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.600]   Well, we get a lot of very heavy marriage questions in our inbox, like this one that's
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   coming up next time.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.840]   It's a question from a couple who finds themselves trying to help care for another couple after
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   the pain of adultery.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.480]   So how does Pastor John enter such a situation and what counsel does he have for couples
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.960]   with a heart for helping hurting couples experiencing this very fallout?
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.880]   Like I said, it's a heavy question, it's a heavy episode, but it's up next time on Friday.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.380]   We'll see you then.
