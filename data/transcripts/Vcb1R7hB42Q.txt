[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.080]   Again, all these questions should relate one way
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.560]   or the other to the general theme of today's show.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.640]   Our first question was about podcasting,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.320]   the ambition to build a podcast.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.200]   And so I asked good friend, Jordan Harbinger,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.520]   host of the Jordan Harbinger Show,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.880]   if he would call in and help me answer it.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.040]   So Jesse, let's see if we can get Jordan on the line.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.660]   - Sounds good, here we go.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.340]   - All right, so it looks like the next question
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.720]   we have coming up is about podcasting.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.800]   So I figured to get to the truth here,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.680]   we should bring onto the show the person I know
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.120]   in this world who knows the most about podcasting.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   That's my friend and friend of the show, Jordan Harbinger.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.840]   Jordan, thank you for agreeing to call in and help me here.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.760]   - My pleasure.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.080]   - Long-time listeners will remember
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.960]   we did a whole episode together,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.880]   and we'll put a link to that in the show notes
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.280]   where we went deep onto the whole state
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.740]   of the podcasting industry at that point.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.920]   So if you've not heard that episode,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.880]   Jordan is the host of the Jordan Harbinger Show,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.760]   one of the best interview podcast out there.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.720]   Jordan, you've been doing this for a long time.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.360]   I have memories, in my memory,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960]   I was being interviewed by you,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600]   and this might be an exaggeration,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.320]   when I was in elementary school.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.800]   - Yeah, that might be an exaggeration,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.560]   but it has been 16 years.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.600]   I think I've been doing podcasts for about 16 years.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.100]   So depending on when you graduated from elementary school,
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.400]   that is possible.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.960]   You were always a little ahead of your time.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.800]   - I am.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.640]   Well, you know, I'm 11 years old right now.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.420]   So I don't know if that's a surprise,
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.000]   but I aged fast.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.420]   It's a hard industry.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.260]   I'm a doogie-houser.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.280]   - Benjamin Button style.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.120]   - I do have to say,
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.740]   and what I like about your show, of course,
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.200]   is the mix of guests.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.740]   I think you're top-notch at this,
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.740]   that you will go from a A-list celebrity to,
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.360]   I mean, the last episode I heard,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.600]   it was an Egyptologist.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.420]   Am I saying that right?
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.920]   I mean, it's like an expert on ancient Egypt.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.680]   You'll even occasionally have bums like me on.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.580]   So just to kind of, you know, to shake it up.
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.880]   But I think you're the best in the biz at interviewing.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   Your show is sort of a standard.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.560]   - Thank you.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.380]   - Definitely at the top of my list.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.560]   So. - I appreciate that.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.120]   - Who else am I gonna call?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.400]   Okay, so here's the question.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.760]   And it's from Nathan.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.640]   I've edited this a little bit.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.680]   "What are all of the different factors
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.280]   that have to come together for a podcast to break out?"
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.840]   No, I think we have to define breakout probably.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.680]   - Sure.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.800]   I think what he means is probably to get an audience
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.480]   where the creator can make a living.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.840]   You don't want to define breakout as,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.680]   all right, I'm the next Andrew Schultz,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.340]   Lex Friedman, Joe Rogan, whatever it is.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.400]   'Cause that type of success comes from
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.360]   using social media effectively over time,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.800]   going on the Joe Rogan podcast a bunch of times,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   ideally, and getting a couple million dollars
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.640]   in free advertising.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.440]   You know, that kind of stuff really helps.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.400]   But ideally, if you're able to create a show
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.320]   and make a living off of it,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.640]   then the factors that need to come together
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.140]   are going to be consistently good content, but over time.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.720]   So in social media, you can go, let's say TikTok,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   which I don't use, but I know enough about it
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.000]   from reading about how toxic it is.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.880]   And I know other social media.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.680]   So it's two guys talking about social,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.840]   two guys who don't use social media
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.020]   talking about social media.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.760]   But what we do know from that is
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.800]   you can go viral from one or two posts.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.120]   You can end up building a little bit of a following.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.600]   And you can go from there.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   With podcasting, it's kind of the opposite.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   You don't really go viral.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.080]   It's really hard to share podcasts.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.600]   You build one tiny little brick at a time.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.520]   You put out a good episode.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.840]   Your current audience of 50 people hears it.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.680]   They share it.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.820]   They say, "This is really good and interesting."
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.980]   You do that for a few years,
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.720]   and suddenly you've got enough,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.000]   let's say, traction or momentum to start monetizing it.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.080]   And then from there, you can start scaling it.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.200]   And it's really all about
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.120]   consistently good quality over time,
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.340]   not one or two hit posts or interviews.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.600]   That is how you do it.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.440]   And all of the other things
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.000]   that people think grow podcasts are kind of,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.360]   it's almost like a myth, right?
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.160]   Oh, I've got to be posting shorts on TikTok.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.880]   I got to be posting shorts on Instagram.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.360]   Cool, you might gain a couple of listeners a day doing that,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.400]   but the juice usually ain't worth the squeeze.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.680]   And retention is a real thing in podcasting.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.520]   So if you're doing a show
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.640]   and it's 30 minutes or an hour long,
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.400]   you're asking people to commit to you.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.520]   So if the content isn't that great,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.840]   but you have really good marketing and social media,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.440]   you're going to get a whole bunch of people in
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   and they're going to leave.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.520]   And it's kind of like trying to fill up a water bucket,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.820]   but there are holes in the bottom.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.240]   You've got to plug those holes up
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.560]   if you're going to be carrying that bucket
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.200]   from the well back to your house.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.120]   So you really need to have that basis
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.640]   of consistently good quality.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   And that doesn't mean celebrity interviews
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.320]   that mean stuff that people can really sink their teeth into
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.520]   whatever niche you're in.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.560]   So that's why you see successful podcasts
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.440]   that are very niche.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.360]   Like my friend runs a podcast
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.480]   where she just reads court documents
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.280]   and talks about what's in the court documents
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.600]   for famous cases.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.360]   It sounds really boring, but they do a really good job
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.680]   because she's actually just reading court documents.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   And she's like, this is what this means.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.060]   And people love it.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.120]   It's very hard to do what, it's harder to do what I do.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.340]   I wouldn't recommend interviewing people
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.040]   that you're interested in as a niche.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.280]   It's a really crap niche.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.440]   You're going to grow really slowly.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.880]   The better you can niche together, niche down,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.200]   I think they call it, the better off you're going to be.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.080]   So don't make it about your personality
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.320]   unless you are a personality for a living
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.440]   like Andrew Schultz or Joe Rogan.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.600]   Do something where you're like,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.360]   this is the radio controlled plane podcast
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.560]   where I talk about radio controlled planes
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.360]   and not about what I did last weekend
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.080]   unless that involves radio controlled planes.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.340]   I only talk about that.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.120]   So that speaks to the content, right?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.740]   You're not re-hammering off.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.820]   It's well organized.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   It's delivered well.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.760]   It's edited and produced well.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.180]   And you do that over time.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.420]   And that's what grows audience.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.580]   And more importantly,
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.140]   keeps audience listening to you over time.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.120]   People try and go too broad.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.100]   They try and make themselves a personality using podcasts
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.460]   because they look at guys like me or Lex
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.860]   or Andrew Huberman or whatever,
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.820]   and they go, oh, I can do that.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.820]   A lot of that is luck, time in the market, experience,
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.040]   picking a really good niche
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.800]   and having the qualifications to go for it.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.200]   And as in the case of Huberman,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.040]   who's like a scientist in his niche,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.280]   that is not a strategy most of us can reproduce.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.120]   - That's interesting.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.080]   Okay, and so when you say,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.740]   and I'll ask a follow-up on Nathan's behalf.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.880]   So it sounds like when you're talking about
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.160]   content, content, content,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.280]   which makes a lot of sense to me,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.840]   content actually captures multiple factors.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.560]   So it's a lot of what you're actually saying,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.620]   but you're also counting in there,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.340]   how does the podcast sound?
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.440]   How is it written?
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.280]   Is it tight?
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.840]   Is it professional?
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.520]   If you're gonna read court documents for celebrity cases,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.120]   I'm assuming for that podcast to work,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.940]   you have to figure out the format for doing that
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.200]   that's actually listenable,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.360]   that you figure that out,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.200]   that we do this and then it's this,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   and this is what's interesting and here's what's not.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.260]   And so you're saying obsessed on content writ large though,
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.580]   basically everything that is going into the listener's ear,
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.840]   you wanna be thinking about all sorts of different angles
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.720]   on that, how could I do that better?
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.200]   Is this compelling?
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.740]   Why would I keep listening to this?
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.640]   Is there anything that's catching my attention as like,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.480]   ooh, what's that?
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.440]   Why is there this?
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.040]   Why is the sound echoey?
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.920]   Why is this, he's rambling?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.880]   So it's really an obsession with everything that comes out
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.120]   of that ear bud into the ear,
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.240]   continuing to push that better.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.080]   - Agree, yeah.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.140]   It has to do with,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.840]   and I'm not saying you have to hire a producer
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.980]   for $500 an hour to make and have music behind everything.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.100]   What you should avoid are the easy to correct pitfalls.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.160]   I was listening to a show the other day,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.080]   really interesting content, really, really good.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.720]   The interviewers weren't bad,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.620]   but there was a point at which the dog was barking
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.540]   and he goes, hold on guys, I gotta go let my dog out.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.560]   And there's just silence for like 30 to 40 seconds
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.180]   where this guy goes and lets his dog out
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.580]   and he left it in the show.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.420]   And I thought that was an inside joke at first,
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.580]   but later on I heard his phone ring
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.560]   and then he got a phone call and took it for a second
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.120]   and said, I gotta call you back and hung up.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.080]   And I thought, oh, this is a person who doesn't understand
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.520]   that every minute of mine you waste,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.980]   you're telling me you don't value my time.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.120]   And so that's not a good look for a podcast host.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.520]   The tighter it is, the better.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.300]   And I'm really cognizant of that.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.920]   I read all the books for my guests, if they have them,
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.080]   when they're on the show,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.780]   as you probably remember from me interviewing you.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.800]   And people will say, why aren't your interviews
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.840]   two or three hours like so-and-so's podcast?
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.120]   And the answer is because I don't need them to be.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.960]   I read the book.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.120]   I know where the important stuff is.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.840]   If you're digging for gold and you have a map
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.000]   where the gold is buried,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.160]   you don't have to spend three times the amount of time
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.120]   looking for it and meandering around
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.200]   and talking about aliens or whatever.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.000]   You can focus on the topic and the task at hand.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And that's really, really beneficial
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.720]   because now I can get the best bang for the buck,
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.960]   the best per minute value for my listener.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.560]   And that's what keeps people sticking around.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.800]   I routinely get feedback like,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   wow, I heard so-and-so on your show
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.120]   and I heard him on this other show
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.920]   and the three-hour interview on this other show
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.720]   had less actual meat on the bone
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.680]   than your 49-minute interview with that same person.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.840]   And that's really, what that does is says to the listener,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.320]   I value your time, we're going for it.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.600]   This is going to be high signal, low noise.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.200]   And that retains people.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.120]   - And it's why I like,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.080]   that comes through in your show, for example,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.720]   because there are other people
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.320]   who are going all in on the interview format.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.120]   And what you're saying, by the way, makes sense.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.520]   Don't try to be you, don't try to be Joe Rogan.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.600]   If anything else, it's just a grind
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.360]   if to try to get enough guests on.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.900]   A lot of the even up-and-coming hosts whose names,
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.080]   I won't say any particular names, it wanders.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.960]   And okay, and your show does it, right?
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.520]   It gets right to the meat of it.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.760]   And you're saying, yeah, because you spend a lot of time.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.720]   You read the books, you think about it.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.920]   You're really obsessing about,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.400]   I want this to be very interesting.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.060]   You're not just putting weight on,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.440]   I'm an interesting guy, which is like the Rogan,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.240]   like Joe Rogan gets away with that.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.920]   He's like, I'm a professional talker.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.760]   I've been podcasting for 80 years.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.440]   I'm an interesting enough guy at this
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.980]   that we will chat for three hours
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.660]   and I can somehow make that interesting.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.640]   But that's like saying,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.480]   I can pitch a baseball 102 miles per hour.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.440]   Like, yeah, that'd be great.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.720]   You're probably gonna get a reliever role,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.460]   but that's not a strategy for everyone else
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.600]   to try to follow, if I'm understanding that right.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.160]   And I would even argue,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.320]   and look, this is probably an unpopular opinion,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.160]   but I would argue that Joe Rogan
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.200]   would be a better interviewer
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.520]   if he would read and prep the interview before the show.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.400]   Because his curiosity takes him
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.920]   to a lot of interesting places,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.200]   but he could also keep that curiosity
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.740]   while not just meandering around
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.920]   and then getting stoned and talking about DMT.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.520]   But again, I know not everybody agrees with that.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.920]   That's just my two cents.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.720]   That's the style in which I do my show,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.280]   which is more focused.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.080]   And look, even if I'm wrong about Joe Rogan,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.960]   we're not wrong about the other 10,000
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.680]   Joe Rogan wannabe clones out there
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.920]   who are trying to do the same thing
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.880]   and wondering why they can't get traction.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.040]   That's one of the reasons.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.400]   - All right, so then one other quick follow-up,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.880]   just a timeline question.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.720]   I'm gonna put some actual projections on this.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.680]   So let's use my own show as a case study.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.400]   It's two and a half years old.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.040]   Does that put it pretty much still
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.400]   in the finding your feet, finding your audience stage?
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.880]   Is that relatively young sometimes for a podcast?
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.680]   Where am I?
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.520]   - Yeah.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.040]   - In a life cycle of a long-term show?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.680]   - It sort of depends on the niche, right?
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.200]   If you're a true crime podcast,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.800]   you can get traction in season one.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.060]   And it's like, wow, this is the biggest thing.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.440]   Look at how many downloads this murder,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.360]   people getting murdered in parks podcast is crushing it.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.520]   That's different than this is a guy
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.280]   who answers questions or gives advice.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.400]   That might take, that could take years to get traction.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.680]   That's why I always tell people like,
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.400]   don't try and emulate what I'm doing.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.440]   I had an 11 year runway before this stuff was really,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.600]   or seven years before this is really doing something.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.320]   The better of a niche you pick, the better off you are.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.800]   The more narrow of an issue you pick, the better off you are.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.520]   So I don't know, two and a half years,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.540]   you've got plenty of traction on your show.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.740]   Is it gonna be bigger in two and a half more years?
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.480]   Of course it is because you're doing well,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.400]   but you're, look, you've been teaching for a while.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.020]   So you bring that skillset in.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.920]   You've got professional recording equipment and help.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.160]   So you've got that skillset.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.240]   You work with some really good advertiser,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.980]   ad sales guys that I know,
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.200]   and some production people that I've worked with.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.040]   They're good.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.720]   So you've got, I would say,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.960]   performance enhancing drugs in your repertoire here, right?
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.120]   With those kinds of things.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   If guys are in their garage basement,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.400]   they're college students, they're doing this,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.840]   they can't afford to hire people.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.400]   They've got whatever they got.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.100]   Their acoustic environment is what it is.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.040]   They can't go to a studio.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.320]   The microphone they got is the biggest expense they have.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.200]   It's going to take a little bit longer
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.940]   because they're not necessarily going to have the option
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.580]   to have professionals helping them out.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.440]   Does that mean their show's going to stay small?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.760]   Not necessarily.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.400]   But again, I'm thankful for the amount of time
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.480]   it took me to become successful
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.040]   because during that time I learned how to interview.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.640]   I don't think you can really speed up experience that much.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   Of course you can a little, but it's very difficult to do it.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.080]   So I'm almost, you wouldn't want to start a podcast
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.940]   and then end up on the top 10 shows all overnight
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.780]   because what'll happen,
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.240]   you wouldn't want Joe Rogan to find you and go,
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   "Come on my show!"
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.880]   And have 10 million people go and listen to your show
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.360]   and 9.9 million of them go, "That was terrible.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.920]   This guy is terrible."
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.760]   You want to slowly build that audience,
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.720]   that loyalty over time and have them share
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.700]   because the snowball is packed tighter,
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.320]   if that analogy makes sense, right?
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.740]   The people stick around longer,
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.000]   your experience speaks for itself after a bit of time.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.520]   You really do have your niche set,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.080]   your personality is set, your style is set.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.440]   It's something that's really hard to rush.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.820]   - Yeah, and I agree with that example
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.660]   because I'm just thinking,
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.920]   I know a lot of people who have gone on Joe Rogan's show
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.200]   and nothing particularly explosive happened.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.440]   But when you see like the other characters you mentioned,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.420]   like Lex or like Andrew doing frequent guest spots,
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.680]   they were doing that at a time,
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.840]   especially in Lex's case,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.960]   where he had a very matured product ready.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.720]   I mean, he had been doing the AI podcast for a long time.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.000]   He had found his voice.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.720]   He had a good audience.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.240]   That's a whole different situation.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   So now you have your thing figured out
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.020]   after years and years of work,
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.260]   then you start getting big exposure.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.140]   You can actually harness it.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.980]   So that all makes sense.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.900]   And I will say, okay,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.860]   so because I'm closer to Nathan,
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.700]   where he would be if he's starting a podcast
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.820]   and obviously you are right now, Jordan,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.160]   you've been doing this forever.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.360]   My thing, Nathan, is this is very hard.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.820]   This has been basically my experience
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.620]   is podcasting is very hard.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.940]   There's a million aspects to go into it,
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.900]   but just the writing of material,
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.220]   communicating clearly, making it interesting.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.100]   It's a slog.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.920]   People do not wanna give you their time lightly
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.600]   and it's really hard to earn it.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.440]   And it really does feel, to me,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.760]   I don't know if you have the same feeling
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.120]   so far into your career, Jordan,
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.680]   but for me, it's month by month, season by season,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.560]   it always feels so slow to me.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   I feel like, why can't I gain traction?
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.580]   Now, if I zoom out, I say, okay,
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.040]   there's a reasonable trajectory here.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.940]   I remember I started taking on advertising
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.000]   when I could hit 15,000 downloads an episode
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.600]   'cause you could do two episodes a week
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.240]   and aggregate to 30 and it was the barrier of entry.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.160]   And now we'll do maybe 50,000 downloads per episode.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.120]   Zooming out, I'm like,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.040]   there's a reasonable trajectory there.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.640]   Every inch along that way has been frustration.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.480]   - I agree with you.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.320]   - This is not growing.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.760]   This is barely growing.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.640]   Also, the stupid download calendar, it's very seasonal.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.960]   So you're always having, in the short term,
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.800]   dips because it's July.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.000]   And so you always feel like you're losing listeners.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.840]   You really have to zoom out before you feel
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.800]   like you're making any traction.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.680]   All right, final follow-up.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.040]   When do you know to pull the ripcord?
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.280]   Most podcasts don't succeed.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.160]   So let's say you're like, I'm into it, I'm committed.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.640]   I'm putting time into it.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   I want this to succeed.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.120]   I'm willing to spend time.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.800]   What's the signs that this is not going to,
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.160]   you're stuck at 10,000 downloads or whatever it is.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.640]   This is not gonna grow enough.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.480]   It's not where it needs to be.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.300]   It's not gonna grow anymore.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.200]   What are the signs for pulling the ripcord?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.000]   - Sure, so I was speaking with Andy Duke on my show.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.040]   It was a recent episode.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.180]   I wish I had the number in front of me,
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.480]   but she talked about quitting.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.800]   That's her new bit of work.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.360]   She's a professional poker player.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.640]   She talks about kill criteria.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.160]   And so kill criteria is where you say,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.280]   before you're, the worst time to make a decision
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.120]   is when you're in it.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   So you say, if I'm not able to pay for the expenses
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.720]   of this podcast by next year, I'm going to stop doing it.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.080]   Or if I'm not able, if I'm not enjoying this in six months,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.240]   I'm going to stop doing it unless it's making X dollars.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.560]   Right, something like that.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.520]   So if, look, the first thing is it could be a hobby.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.400]   That's totally okay.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.760]   In fact, I'm usually against people turning hobbies
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.520]   into jobs because it's a great way to,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.440]   it's a good way to ruin your hobby.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.520]   So if you're doing a podcast and you like it
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.660]   and you don't have that many listeners, who cares?
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.600]   Just keep doing it.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.720]   It's a hobby.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.520]   But if you are deluding yourself and saying,
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.360]   this is going to be my job, but you have 500 listeners
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.280]   and then a year later you have 600 listeners,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.840]   it's very unlikely that you are going
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.000]   to build enough traction to create a living for yourself.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.400]   Again, if you enjoy doing it, who cares?
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   Just keep doing it.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.280]   But don't try to make yourself the exception in your mind
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.240]   that you are going to be the special one
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.040]   who's going to turn this thing into a job overnight
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.400]   because it's very, very hard to do.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.080]   And so I would set up kill criteria.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.640]   And I would say, look, if I don't enjoy it,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.200]   I'm going to stop doing it.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   And if you're trying to monetize this
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.440]   and you're sort of halfway there,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.760]   like maybe you're making a few thousand dollars a month
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.680]   for a year and it's not enough to quit your job,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.600]   then you have to decide what you're comfortable with.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.640]   If you're spending 20 hours on your podcast,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.040]   but a lot of it feels like work
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.520]   and it's not paying for itself,
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.640]   set up kill criteria where you decide,
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.520]   this is when I'm going to stop doing it
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.440]   and this is when I'm going to really go for it.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.520]   There's not a go all in type of thing
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.360]   unless you're really hitting those financial metrics.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.120]   What I usually recommend instead of trying to figure out
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.880]   how to make this your job is partially monetize it
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.240]   if you're in that position to do so.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.200]   Let's say you're making $500 a month,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.360]   use that money to take the part of it
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.760]   that you don't like doing,
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.600]   maybe the editing you don't like doing.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   Hire an editor.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.000]   Now you've got a hobby where you just do the fun parts.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.320]   It's like, if you're really into radio control cars
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   and you've got money from it,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.920]   let's say you're making a YouTube channel for that
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.720]   and you're making a thousand dollars a month,
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.760]   take that money and pay someone to fix the cars
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.800]   when you break them, then you're just running them.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.860]   Now you've got a great hobby
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.240]   where all the stuff you don't like doing
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.840]   is not your problem anymore.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.440]   That's the way to do this.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.880]   Start outsourcing as much stuff as you can
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.840]   so that if you do hit that sort of inflection point
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.800]   where you're making enough to make it your job,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.720]   you're not then doing everything yourself
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   and becoming miserable in the process.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.400]   You've already outsourced everything else.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.120]   So now your hobby happens to be lucrative.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.740]   Now that's the best position for you to be in,
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.580]   in my opinion.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.640]   - Jordan, great advice.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.680]   I appreciate you coming on to help me with this one
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.360]   because I'm usually just grabbing in the dark.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.560]   Also a great time to announce my new podcast.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.320]   It's called Deep RC.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.280]   It's all about radio-controlled cars.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.120]   And I just get into it.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.480]   It's four hours per episode and we do circuit schematics.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.320]   We just walk through the circuit schematics.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.680]   It's scintillating audio.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.040]   So you say, okay, and then just--
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.840]   - Actually, there's no plan for the episode
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.200]   in the beginning whatsoever.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.400]   - Exactly. - Whatever we want.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.920]   - Yeah, it's me and eight other people
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.200]   and we record it outside.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.720]   All right, Jordan-- - On AirPods.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   - On AirPods, exactly.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.280]   I appreciate it.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.960]   Everyone, the Jordan Harbinger Show,
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.600]   I think it's the best interview podcast out there.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.320]   If you wanna see how a pro does it, listen to that.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.520]   You won't regret it.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.640]   All right, thanks, Jordan.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.480]   - Thank you.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.640]   (upbeat music)
