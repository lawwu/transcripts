[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   - Today, God has blessed us with countless numbers
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.080]   of faithful men who lead churches well.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.800]   And we praise God for each man who closely guards his life
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.260]   and his doctrine for the sake of his own soul
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.600]   and for the sake of the souls entrusted to him.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.520]   Such faithful men will go unnoticed by the world
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.680]   and maybe even under thanked for their work
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.360]   by the people they serve.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.680]   But we thank God for you men,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200]   many of you listen to this podcast.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.960]   So we are grateful to God for you, each of you.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   At the same time, one of the most painful topics
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   we see pop up in the inbox regularly
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.040]   is the fallout over the sins of unfaithful pastors.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760]   Pastors can fail their people by not watching their lives,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.440]   not watching their doctrine.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.320]   And these situations are tragic and very painful
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.000]   and often devastating.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.280]   The heartbreaking stories we hear bears this out.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.000]   No church is immune from this.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.800]   The compromise happens in huge suburban mega churches
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   and it happens in very small rural country churches too.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.180]   And it was a problem even among the priests
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.640]   of the Old Testament calling for the stern warnings
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.960]   we read in the prophets.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.620]   In fact, God reserves some of the harshest language
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.240]   in the Bible for priests who morally fail,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.820]   as we'll see today in Malachi 2, verses one to nine.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.360]   This text remains relevant for pastors today
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   as Pastor John explained in 1987
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.680]   in a sermon from about 34 years ago.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.440]   Here now is Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.240]   - But we noticed in verse seven of this text
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   that that wasn't the only task of the priest,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.200]   namely to sacrifice.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.640]   Let's read verse seven.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.240]   The lips of a priest should guard knowledge
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020]   and men should seek instruction from his mouth
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.840]   for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.200]   In other words, priests were teachers
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.960]   and not just sacrificers.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.360]   And that's why the text is relevant today.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.240]   This text addresses ministers of the word
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.160]   and it shows that they can fail miserably and grievously
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.360]   and that they can succeed gloriously.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   That's what the text is about.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.000]   That's why it's so relevant
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.920]   because it's all around us today,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.960]   ministerial failure and success.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.680]   I ended with an overview last time
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800]   and began what I wanna begin this morning,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.200]   namely a list of these failures
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.440]   and then turn to the success of the ministry.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.680]   Let me give you that overview again.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.120]   Verses two, eight and nine
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200]   give us five failures in the priestly ministry,
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400]   five pastoral failures.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   Verses five, six and seven
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.960]   describe the success of the ministry of the word,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.160]   what it's supposed to look like.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   And the thing I didn't mention last week
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   were the threats made against the priests, the pastors
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.200]   to sanction the commands in verses five to seven
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.880]   and to redeem them and get them to clean up their act
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.080]   with regard to their failures.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   And those threats are found in verses two, three and nine.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.560]   And it may be well to begin right here.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.600]   Let's just start with the threats
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.960]   and then we start here because they're given
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   mainly not for themselves,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.040]   but to awaken these failing priests,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   rescue them from destruction and bring them to success.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800]   Here's the lesson I get from these threats
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.920]   before I look at them in detail.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.400]   Pastors, ministers of the word
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.080]   will not be spared judgment in the last day.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.280]   It's occurred to me this week as I've pondered this
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   that when I stand before Christ at the last day,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.120]   every one of these sermons will be thrown on the table
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.120]   before the judge and Romans 2 21 will be read
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.880]   in the courtroom as I stand before Christ.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.560]   Goes like this, "You who taught others,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.680]   did you not teach yourself?
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.760]   Think long and hard before you envy your pastors
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   at the last day."
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.960]   And James said, "Let not many of you become teachers
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   for they will be judged with greater strictness."
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.800]   Now let's read these threats.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.960]   Verses two and three, and then I'll drop down to verse nine.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.920]   "If you will not listen,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.760]   if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name,"
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.400]   says the Lord of hosts, "then I will send a curse on you.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.600]   I will curse your blessings.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.480]   Indeed, I have already cursed them
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.800]   because you do not lay it to heart.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.280]   Behold, I will rebuke your offering or your seed,"
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.000]   perhaps referring to the crops,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.600]   "and spread dung on your faces.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   The dung of your sacrifices I will put
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   and I will put you out of my presence."
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.840]   Now down to verse nine.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.840]   "And so I make you despised and abased
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.400]   before all the people in as much as you have not kept
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600]   my ways but have shown partiality in your teaching."
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.520]   Now there are four threats in those three verses.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.600]   Number one, verse two, "I will curse them."
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.200]   Number two, in verse two,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.960]   "I will make your blessings a curse."
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.120]   That is, I think he means the words that you speak
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.160]   which are intended to be the blessing of the people,
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.240]   I'm gonna turn them into a plague upon the people.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.160]   Number three, in verse three,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   "I'm gonna rebuke your offspring or your crops," perhaps.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.840]   The word seed could go either way there.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.600]   In other words, the curse is gonna spread far beyond you,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.920]   whether to your children or to your land.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.160]   And finally, number four,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.880]   "I am going to smear the dung of these mangy,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   broken-legged, blind sheep in your face."
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.440]   Or as verse nine explains,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.080]   "I'm gonna make you despised and contemptible
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.200]   among the people."
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   Now, why is God so angry?
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   You know He's angry, don't you?
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.200]   I mean, when you talk about smearing dung
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.160]   in somebody's face, you're not dealing dispassionately
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.080]   with some minor disobedience.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.520]   You're on the brink of rage.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.120]   Nothing is more horrible to imagine
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   than the beauty of holiness
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.040]   turning against you with omnipotent rage,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.760]   which is what's happening in these verses
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.800]   towards the pastors of Israel.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.600]   He is angry because of five failures.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.560]   Let's look at them.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.160]   Number one, the failure of listening to God
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.640]   or failing to listen to God.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.480]   Verse two, "If you will not listen."
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.280]   It's a failure because you can't herald what you can't hear.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.440]   Number two, the failure to have a heart
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.880]   for the glory of God.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   Verse two again, next phrase,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.360]   "If you will not lay it to heart
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.880]   to give glory to my name," says the Lord.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.240]   And that's the root of the matter,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.480]   brothers and sisters.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.440]   We're gonna see more clearly than ever this morning
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.920]   as we move to the success.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.800]   That's the root of the matter.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.720]   A pastor who has no heart for the glory of God
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.840]   is a failure, no matter how full his church is,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.640]   nor wide his ministry.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.680]   Number three, they have turned aside
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.400]   from the ways of God and live lives out of sync
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.240]   with the teaching of God.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.920]   Look at the first line of verse eight.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.560]   "You have turned aside from the way."
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.240]   And look again at verse nine.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   "I make you despised and abased
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.800]   before all the people inasmuch as you have not kept my ways."
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.000]   So the third failure is the failure
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.600]   of practicing what they preach.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.040]   Their lives are way over here.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.360]   They're not walking with God.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.560]   They say one thing and they're doing another thing.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   Number four, they have shown partiality in teaching.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.400]   The last line of verse nine.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.640]   "You have not walked in my ways,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   but you have shown partiality in your instruction."
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.840]   Now what does that mean?
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.720]   It means that they are doing the very same thing
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.480]   with the Word of God that they did
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.800]   with the sacrifices of God.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.880]   You remember what that was?
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.880]   They gave just those animals to God
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.320]   that would leave maximum money in their pockets.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.960]   Broken-legged sheep, blind sheep, mangy sheep.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.600]   You can't sell them, give them to God
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   and keep your pockets full.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.520]   And that's exactly what they're doing with their teaching.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.600]   They give precisely that teaching to their congregations
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.000]   that will keep their pockets full.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.360]   They play to their audience.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.120]   They tell Daddy Warbucks what he wants to hear.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.800]   They say, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   They do what Micah chapter three, verse 11 describes.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.120]   "The heads of Jerusalem give judgment for bribe.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.160]   Its priests teach for hire."
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.000]   You hear that?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.720]   "Its priests teach for hire.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.120]   Its prophets divine for money."
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.000]   When the glory of God no longer satisfies
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.200]   the heart of a preacher, he can do two things.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.520]   Leave the ministry or stay and preach for money.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.200]   Would that they all left.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.520]   Number five, the failure of what results from all of this
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.680]   in the middle of verse eight, do you see it?
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   You have caused many to stumble.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.880]   Let me ask you this.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.480]   Do you think the sins of pastors,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.720]   Christian leaders are more grievous
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.160]   than the sins of others?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.560]   I do.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.560]   Not because a sin in and of itself
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.880]   is of a different nature or quality,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.440]   but rather because the sin of Christian leaders
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.480]   is compounded by the fact that the weight
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.880]   of public responsibility should all the more
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.560]   have hindered it, and he didn't let it hinder it.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.120]   I don't know if you've opened up yet
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.840]   this week's Christianity Today.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.760]   It's in our library.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.800]   I commend it to you.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.880]   There are two or three articles
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.040]   on the sins of Christian leaders
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.400]   and whether they can be restored.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.520]   And there is a short article by David Neff,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.320]   the associate editor.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   And here's what he says.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   The leader who philanders has broken a trust
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.960]   placed in him by a wide community,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   trusting his vision, reliability, wisdom, and veracity.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.520]   And the essence of leadership is that trust.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.800]   And so a leader who violates trust
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.000]   in a fundamental and public manner
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   is ipso facto no longer a leader.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.960]   And I believe he's right.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.440]   Now, I want to turn so badly
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.120]   to the success of the pastoral ministry,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.200]   but before we get there,
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.240]   I want to apply what I've said so far
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.480]   to those of you here today
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.440]   who have been victims of priestly failure.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.520]   Now, have in mind people who have seen
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.960]   in the ministers of the word
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.720]   enough hypocrisy and expediency and inconsistency
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   and worldliness and partiality and greed and cowardice
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.320]   and pettiness and harshness and insensitivity
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.040]   that you have stamped a big question mark
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.840]   over the whole Christian enterprise.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.440]   You have built a wall, perhaps,
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.640]   in your soul, in your heart,
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.520]   that keeps out anything from the Christian world
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.280]   because you just aren't sure you want to have anything to do
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.040]   with that mess anymore.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.920]   Now, there is a word in this text
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.280]   to people like that here this morning.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.440]   And I want to paraphrase it as best I can.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.480]   Let me paraphrase what I think God is saying
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.680]   to that kind of person here this morning,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.160]   the victims of priestly failure.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.960]   Here's what he's saying.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   I hate ministerial hypocrisy
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.280]   10,000 times more than you do.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.960]   And I intend to spread dung
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   on the faces of ministerial hypocrites,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   those who have forsaken my glory,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.800]   departed from my ways,
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.440]   teach for hire and cause people to stumble.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.200]   Vengeance is mine.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.600]   I will repay.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.920]   Don't carry it.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.320]   Don't carry it.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.080]   It is mine.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.440]   And I will repay with vengeance
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.080]   vastly worse than you can imagine
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.360]   in your little vindictive moments.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.560]   What a tragedy it would be this morning
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.040]   if anyone turned away
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   from the glory,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   the unimpeachable glory of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.520]   the King of Kings,
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.160]   because of a hypocritical demeanor
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.080]   or a failure of one of His messengers
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.800]   when God Himself intends to spread dung
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   on the face of that minister
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.160]   because He loves you
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.320]   and hates it when His glory is profaned.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.240]   Wouldn't that be an ironic tragedy
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   if you let that hypocrite drag you to hell with Him?
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.720]   Don't let that happen.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.120]   Don't let Satan use
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   his lightning-cloaked ministers of the Word
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.720]   to drag you to hell with them.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.200]   That's what he's saying in this text
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.600]   to victims of priestly failure.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.400]   - Amen.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.320]   That is a sobering but relevant word today.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.200]   And more positively,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.920]   Pastor John goes on to celebrate the glories
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.720]   of pastoring well in his sermon titled
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.640]   "The Glory of Priestly Success,"
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.040]   preached on November 15th, 1987.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.440]   The whole message is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.520]   This clip was sent in to us by Scott,
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   a pastor in Atlanta,
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.080]   who was moved by this clip
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.680]   to rededicate his ministry to the glory of God
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.080]   and to double down on personal holiness.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.760]   So thank you, Scott, for sending in this selection.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.440]   I had never heard this sermon before.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.240]   It's very much appreciated.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.920]   Well, our clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons impacted you,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.720]   and we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.320]   And if you got one, email me.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.520]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.160]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.040]   and then tell me how it impacted you.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.880]   Put the word clip in a subject line of an email
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.280]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.920]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.480]   Well, God is our refuge and our fortress.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.440]   And in the great refuge psalm of Psalm 91,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.400]   we are given this glorious promise
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.200]   that he who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.080]   It's the first verse of Psalm 91.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.960]   So how do we do this?
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.920]   Like, how do we dwell in the shelter of the Most High?
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.200]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.640]   for that when we return on Friday.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.540]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:39.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
