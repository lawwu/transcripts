[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.560]   (Music)
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.600]   Spiritual warfare is very real in our lives and the battle for our morning devotions is a never-ending struggle for many of us,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.560]   one that we often lose. I know I lose...
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.360]   many times and our attention is under relentless attack for vain things and for
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.400]   personal approval and for desires that lure us online immediately in the morning.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.680]   So how do we preserve those mornings? That is the topic today. Jackie Hill Perry is our guest.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.640]   That intro was from her new album, Crescendo. Check it out. But the following is from her
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.000]   Twitter feed. "As soon as you wake, there is a war to keep you from the word of God. Fight!"
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.600]   Exclamation point, end quote. Yes, fight. So what's at stake, Jackie, and how do we fight?
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.160]   How do we win this war? This one is hard because I feel like this is a daily constant war for me.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.240]   I think when I got married and when I had children, the war got harder. And that's not to say that in
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.600]   singleness is not, but I feel like I had more meaningful distractions. And what I mean by that
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.480]   is when I was single, I kind of just, you know, I just had work, you know, I just woke up kind of
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.480]   when I wanted to wake up because I was self-employed. You know, I could spend the time of
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.000]   the world for like an hour if I chose to. Now it's if I need to, if I want to spend uninterrupted time
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.960]   with God, I need to wake up before my children do. And so stuff like that. So I think the war is,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.240]   man, do I make time for God or do I try to fit God into the time that I feel like I already don't
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.120]   have? And so when I wake up, it's a daily decision. And I think one of my mistakes is, I know this
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.600]   personally, is that I sleep with my phone. I know for a fact, if I got rid of my phone, my distractions
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.280]   would be not as close or nearby. And so I think what's at stake ultimately is my love of the Lord.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.200]   I was thinking about this yesterday at church when our pastor, he caught on to Beatitudes and
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.680]   he talked about how, you know, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. And he
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.720]   was, he was rooting his text and our love for God and our love for the word. And the thought that
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.680]   came to my mind is if I'm not delighting in the word of God, then most likely I'm not delighting
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.520]   in God himself. And so I think that's ultimately is at stake is my affections. What are my
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.160]   affections in? If my affections are in my sleep, then I'm going to treasure sleep over the word.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.560]   If my affections are in my emails, then I'm going to treasure my emails over the word. If my
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.880]   affections are in my time, then my time is going to be preeminent over the preeminent one. And so
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.920]   I think identifying what really is my joy, is it God? Is it my stuff? Is it my peace or what I think
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800]   is peace? Because I'm able to sit up and watch Netflix when I could be reading Psalms. I think
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.480]   identifying those things that are really legitimately good things and opportunities
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.360]   for leisure that I've made an idol in many ways. And so, yeah, what's at stake is me and Jesus
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.480]   being good. What's the impulse online that you feel? How does it manifest in your life?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.600]   I think it's, I love information. And so before I go to bed, one of my things before I go to bed is
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.800]   I tend to just Wikipedia random things. So it's like...
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.880]   Okay, give us an example.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.520]   So for example, there was this show, I think it's called Genius on National Geographic,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.400]   and it was about Picasso. I was like, "Huh, I wonder, I just want to know his name. I want
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   to know where he's from. I want to know when he started painting." And then I realized he had
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   13 names in his name. And so I just go on this rabbit trail where I'm Wikipedian facts about,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   Wikipedian, whatever. I'm on Wikipedia learning about people. So when I wake up, that information,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.120]   that desire for information is still there. It just tends to lean towards wanting information
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.800]   from secular sources. And so what does Twitter have to say today? What's the news? Oh, LeBron
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.080]   got signed to LA. I wonder how much he made. Like my mind is just wondering about everything that
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.000]   happened while I was asleep instead of waking up to wonder about the glory of God and his
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   scriptures. And so I think that's something that I need to consistently, have to consistently kill,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.640]   is this desire to esteem the new information over the lasting information.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.400]   This is good. So what else can we learn from Jackie Hill Perry about social media in this
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.520]   fight in the mornings?
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.760]   Man, you wrote a great book about it.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:56.480]   But I think it's our hearts. I actually asked a friend of mine from church. She is nearing her
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.240]   forties. And I wanted to know, I said, like in your, when, like in the eighties and stuff like
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.440]   that, when you were around, I know that distractions haven't necessarily, distractions aren't a new
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.880]   thing. They just transform and they, you know, do that. I was like, so what was the distraction for
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.080]   you guys? She was like TV. She was like, there was this, there was this influx of sitcoms and VHS
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.680]   tapes and all of this type of stuff that we were just consuming on a daily basis. And I was like,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.360]   huh. And so I think ultimately we have to learn how to navigate this world that we're in with
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.280]   distractions as a whole, and just see that like, man, this will, this will subtly take our attention
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.360]   away from God if we let it. But I think as we, as we learn to love God more, it really becomes
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.240]   easier to resist. I think it's as simple as that.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   So true. Yeah. I'm thinking of the parable of the four soils. I mean, the desire for
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   riches has always been a distraction to the gospel. I mean, since the dawn of time,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.800]   even before the media age. That's real true.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.680]   Jackie, this has been a short, but wonderful week with you. Thank you for joining us.
