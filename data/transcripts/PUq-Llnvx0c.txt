[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   I think you'll find that there are a few companies that tend to operate lounges on behalf of
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.480]   airlines, but they won't put their branding on it.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.400]   So for example, Plaza Premium operates lounges for a number of airlines and things like that
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.020]   around the world.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.100]   The club operates the Chase Sapphire lounges, for example.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.240]   But a lot of times they won't make that really well known.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.480]   The Virgin Atlantic Lounge, for example, Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, a lot of them are operated
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.220]   by Plaza Premium.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.680]   And you can actually get into those with Plaza Premium.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.180]   If you have a car that offers Plaza Premium access, you can get into a Virgin Atlantic
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.940]   Clubhouse.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.200]   But they don't really do a lot of advertising.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.980]   It's not very common to buy access to it directly or something like that.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.720]   So it's not the same as like a priority pass.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.660]   But there are definitely networks of companies out there that will operate lounges on behalf
