[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Here's a relevant and timely question from Alex.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.120]   Pastor John, what do you do when your pastor
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120]   is fixated and preoccupied with all the negative
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.320]   state of affairs in the world today?
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   When he is constantly telling the congregation
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.640]   that Jesus must come soon in order to stem
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.140]   the moral collapse of society,
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.760]   and that the government is to be blamed,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.280]   and other pastors who are not preaching
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.660]   against societal evils are to be blamed as well.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.760]   Any thoughts for Alex in how he thinks through this issue?
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.720]   - Any thoughts?
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.080]   (laughing)
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.120]   Hmm, lots of thoughts.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.120]   Like, we don't know when Jesus is coming back,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.520]   and there have always been cultural collapses in history,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.600]   worse than the one we're in,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.920]   great changes in Christian civilization
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.440]   so that what we're experiencing now
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.360]   is no more apocalyptic, say, than the destruction
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   of a thousand years of Christian history in the Near East.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.680]   I just read Philip Jenkins' "The Lost History
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.840]   of Christianity" a few months ago, and good night.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.160]   Oh my, does everybody need to realize
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.820]   the sovereignty of God in the flow and the scope of history?
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.020]   What a devastating thing, as whole Christian cultures
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.000]   vanished in the Near East a thousand years ago,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.800]   which would have appeared more apocalyptic
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.720]   than anything we're in now.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.800]   So that's my first thought.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.680]   An alarmist approach toward eschatology
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.720]   is usually historically naive.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.720]   By all means, let's always, always, always be vigilant
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.540]   and watchful and mindful of the glorious coming
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.640]   of the Lord Jesus, He's gonna arrive.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   He's going to arrive suddenly
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.960]   when the Father has appointed it,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.840]   and nobody's gonna be able to nail that
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.400]   with their prediction.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   But that's not my main thought in responding to this,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.000]   and I don't think that's really
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.340]   the questioner's main concern.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.340]   My main concern is how, and I may be guilty of this myself,
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.560]   how do we maintain the right balance
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.680]   between weeping for sin and the misery
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.280]   of the world around us, on the one hand,
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.000]   and joy because of what Christ has done for us
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.160]   and who He is and what He's promised now and forever,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160]   and what's gonna happen to this world ultimately?
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.920]   How do we put those together?
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.400]   That's the great challenge for the pastor
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.520]   and really for all Christians,
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   but especially leaders who are charged
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.680]   with setting the tone of a people.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.720]   So here are some thoughts about that.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.800]   Whatever measure of pessimism a pastor may feel
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   or I may feel about our own society as Christians,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.720]   we should be long-term optimists.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.480]   And I think premillennialists and amillennialists
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.600]   can say this with as much or more confidence
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.760]   than postmillennialists,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.280]   though everybody can say it in those three camps.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   Sooner or later, Christ is in fact going to break in
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.360]   to this world and put everything right.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.800]   He is going to cast the weeds into outer darkness,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.760]   and He's going to establish His kingdom,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.580]   and the world will be full of the glory of the Lord,
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.120]   like the waters cover the sea,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   and righteousness and justice and peace will kiss
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.700]   all for the glory of Christ.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.680]   That's coming, and we should be deeply,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.820]   deeply confident and optimistic about it.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200]   Second thought is that we must believe
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.980]   in the sovereignty of God as the Bible teaches it.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.360]   How easy it is to put the sovereignty of God to the side
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.540]   while lamenting the miseries and wickedness of this world.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.980]   God is in charge of the world.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.260]   This is one of the great benefits
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.160]   of reading the whole Bible cover to cover every year.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.320]   I am so thankful I've done that for, what, 30 years?
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.220]   I don't know.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.020]   You watch the terrible sweep of evil in the world,
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.180]   and the Bible portrays it better than anybody.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.180]   The sweep of evil from century to century in the world,
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.820]   and you have this rugged, unwavering, biblical perspective
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.360]   that God is on His throne and is in charge
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.020]   over the world, and evil does not, will not triumph.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.660]   So that note must be struck.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.900]   The sovereignty of God by a pastor must be struck over
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.540]   and over again because his people are gonna start losing it
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.500]   as things get bad.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.280]   Third thought is that every pastor
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.960]   should be a Christian hedonist,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.000]   whether he embraces the term or not.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   That means he should see the pursuit of joy in God
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.940]   as an essential way for him and his people
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.720]   to glorify God in every circumstance.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.380]   And if it's essential, and I've argued all over the place
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.220]   that it is, if it's an essential way to glorify God,
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.300]   then it must be highlighted in his ministry
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.380]   over and over again because people tend to drift away
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.960]   from joy in Christ as circumstances get bleak.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.060]   We all do, and pastors are charged,
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.000]   help your people not drift from joy in Christ
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.220]   in the worst of times.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.220]   Joy in Christ in those circumstances is what glorifies Christ.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.220]   That's the essence of Christian hedonism.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.720]   Fourth thought, which is very related to the third,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.380]   and yet I think deserves a special focus,
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.380]   2 Corinthians 6.10, "Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing."
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.960]   In other words, no matter how bad it gets,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.860]   as sorrow mounts up upon sorrow,
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.300]   nevertheless, there will always be Christian rejoicing.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.600]   Pastors are duty-bound to help their people
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.460]   understand that phrase and live it,
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.460]   and see why it is and model it for them.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.980]   To be sure, let no one misunderstand,
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.380]   to be sure, we weep with those who weep.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.600]   We groan over the wickedness of our cities.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.660]   If we don't, we're guilty.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.020]   But in all our weeping, all our groaning,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.500]   there is an indomitable joy.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.920]   If there's not, then the Bible is delivering
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.920]   a false message, and our gospel is not triumphant.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.040]   And maybe one more.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980]   Fifth, final thought for pastors from Hebrews 13.17.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.940]   It says that pastors are keeping watch over your souls,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.540]   namely keeping watch over the flock in their charge,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.180]   and then it says, "Let them do this with joy,
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.620]   "not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.320]   "to you, to the people."
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.620]   Now, what pastors should get from that sentence,
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.260]   Hebrews 13.17, is that if they go about their work
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.860]   of preaching and pastoral care with groaning,
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.300]   and a gloomy demeanor, because of the state of the world,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.140]   it will be of no advantage to the people.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.500]   A gloomy pastor makes a sick congregation.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.940]   So, let's pray for our pastors, and for ourselves,
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.940]   one, that God would make them and us long-term optimists.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.900]   Number two, that He would make us lovers
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.740]   of the sovereignty of God.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.220]   Three, that we would be totally committed
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.380]   to the truth that God is most glorified in us
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.180]   when we're most satisfied in Him.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.260]   Fourth, that we would be sustained,
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.700]   and our pastor would be sustained
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   by the reality of sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.860]   And finally, number five, let's pray that we,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.980]   and he, the pastor, would be deeply committed
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.060]   to doing the ministry with joy,
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.980]   so that we will build a healthy church
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.700]   in the midst of a cultural collapse,
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.880]   not a gloomy, sick church that doesn't contribute
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.380]   anything to the solution.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.220]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
