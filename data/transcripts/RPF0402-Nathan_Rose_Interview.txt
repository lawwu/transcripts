[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.140]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host and today we have Nathan Rose on the line.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.920]   Nathan has recently completed a book called Equity Crowdfunding, the Complete Guide for
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320]   Startups and Growing Companies.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320]   Nathan, welcome to the show.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.160]   It's great to be here, Joshua, and thanks for having me.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.160]   I'm excited about this topic because I love the world we live in where more and more money
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.760]   is not the limiting factor to the success of a product or of a company.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.580]   And crowdfunding has certainly presented one tremendous technology to be able to help entrepreneurs
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.480]   capitalize projects.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.200]   So I'm very excited about talking to you and hearing about some of the ideas in your book.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.320]   But start with a little bit of a personal introduction.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.280]   How did you get interested in this subject?
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.640]   So I began my career as an investment banker.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.080]   Don't hold that against me.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.720]   I was helping out startups and even past the startup phase, in fact, early stage companies
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.000]   do initial public offerings onto the stock market.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.800]   And when I saw the emergence of equity crowdfunding as being a similar skill set, it's an offer
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.480]   of shares to the public, so you've got to do the same things about explaining business
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.240]   models and explaining why a company is a good idea to invest in.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.360]   And at the same time, I wanted to branch off away from my corporate career and start my
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   own thing.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.680]   It just seemed the perfect fit for my skill set and a really new interesting trend that
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.640]   I saw in the world of finance.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.240]   So you work as a consultant or what's your actual business now?
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.080]   Yeah, I'm an agency or a consultancy, I suppose you'd call it, where I will help startups
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.520]   and growing companies to fund through equity crowdfunding.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.960]   So a typical client might come to me and say, hey, we need 500k or a million.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.720]   And we've heard about this thing called equity crowdfunding, but they need to be stepped
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.560]   through it, whether it's really right for them.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.720]   And if they decided it is right for them, things like valuation, choosing a platform,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   coming up with a marketing strategy and what happens afterwards.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.800]   So the book's really just an outgrowth of the services that I provide to clients one
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   on one.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Great.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000]   So it's a way of helping the marketplace with some information and also establishing your
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.160]   brand which will lead to personal services.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   Awesome.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.880]   So I'm going to lob you a softball here to start off with.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.160]   I think everybody thinks that crowdfunding is easy and it's great.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.120]   After all, you just come up with a great idea and make a video and then it gets shared a
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.800]   million times on Facebook and you raise $20 million and you're done.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   I know from a little bit of study it's not quite that way.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.680]   So who should consider using crowdfunding and who should stay away?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.560]   So I'd like to take a step back before we even get into that and just explain the difference
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.120]   between the crowdfunding in general and equity crowdfunding.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.400]   So crowdfunding as most people think of it is the Kickstarters and Indiegogos where you're,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.080]   if it's a business, pre-ordering a product or offering your customers the chance to pre-order
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.480]   a product.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.760]   And most people are familiar with that.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.120]   We've all heard the stories of Oculus Rift and these big success stories, which are not
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.720]   typical by the way, as you've already alluded to.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.240]   And then equity crowdfunding where instead of giving people a chance to pre-order a product,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.480]   you're instead offering shares in that company.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.920]   And this has some similarities with the other type of Kickstarter Indiegogo crowdfunding,
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.160]   but also some really important differences.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.480]   Your question was about how easy or how difficult it is.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.760]   And it is difficult.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.640]   There is time involved and the part that the public see where it just seems to be a video
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.400]   and a couple of pages of copy and the money just pouring on in, there's a lot of preparation
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.600]   that goes into that.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.480]   You've got to connect with an existing crowd.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.760]   It's not the case that there's just all these people hanging out on the internet waiting
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.960]   to hand you this money.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.120]   You've got to find them and you've got to convince them as to why your idea is worth
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120]   funding.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.080]   I appreciate you making the distinction because I didn't read the book prior to the interview
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.280]   and so I was heading us in completely the wrong direction, in the direction of crowdfunding
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.560]   instead of equity crowdfunding.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.040]   So that makes it even more important to clarify.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.320]   So I'll just ask, now that you've clearly identified and appreciated that distinction,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.480]   who then should be considering using the equity crowdfunding process?
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.900]   Well, it's an alternative to angel funding and venture funding.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.760]   So the types of companies that that will suit are ones which are past the idea phase, so
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.160]   they've at least got some users and ideally revenue.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.280]   Not necessarily profitable, but they have a proven business that's got customers and
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.880]   money coming through the door.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.880]   They're looking to raise at least 30 to 50 thousand US dollars, up to a maximum, which
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.520]   depends where you are, but if we're talking about America here, it's going to be capped
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.920]   at a million US dollars.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.480]   So in order to justify those sorts of numbers, raising a million dollars, your business has
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.680]   to have a justification, I suppose, for being worth a lot more than that, because if you're
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.520]   offering up a piece of your company for a million dollars, then your company, for you
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.640]   to retain some share in it, needs to be worth, say, at least three or four million.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.160]   So that should give you a bit of an idea about what your company's stage should be at before
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.720]   looking at doing this, and the types of businesses that it'll suit.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   Because it's an offer over the internet, it's going to suit much better companies that have
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.360]   some kind of reach beyond their own neighbourhood.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   So it's not so useful for the corner store, very localised businesses who don't gain much
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.840]   benefit out of a nationwide or global audience.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:25.760]   It's much more suitable for scalable businesses in the fintech or medtech area, and also for
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.840]   businesses with a broader reach with consumer items.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.800]   So think food or drink, cosmetics, clothing, that kind of thing.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.320]   So you can think of it in two camps.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.520]   The really scalable businesses on one hand, which some people think of as unicorns, a
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.140]   word in startup parlance which means a company with a chance of being worth a billion dollars
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.480]   one day, and the local businesses with a crowd, as I call them in the book, which have got
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.680]   a natural group of people around them, some existing users.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.120]   What's the benefit for the entrepreneur of going this route instead of working with individual
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.760]   private investors?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.520]   I think the big one is being able to do two of the things at the same time, which are
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.840]   core to the mission, I suppose, of an early stage company.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.320]   So early stage companies are often trying to get attention, marketing exposure, and
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.560]   also to raise funds.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.320]   And those two things have always been considered to be separate activities.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.800]   But equity crowdfunding, because you're promoting your business in a very public forum, doing
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.720]   a lot of outreach effort at the same time, you're gaining both marketing exposure and
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.200]   equity money at the same time.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.360]   Other reasons, there's some strings attached always when you take money from a VC or from
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.640]   an angel investor, they're probably going to have a say in the direction of your business,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.120]   which a lot of entrepreneurs don't like.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.840]   If they are very much enamoured with the idea of retaining independence and full control
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.800]   of their culture, then bringing in this VC investor is going to screw with that.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.360]   They're going to have their own way of doing things.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.800]   But by getting money from lots of very small investors, none of whom have a very large
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.840]   say or much of a seat at the table, you can raise this money without really altering your
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.480]   culture too much.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.760]   Tell me your, I'm sure you've got one company or one experience that you go to, it's like
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.400]   this was a beautiful scenario.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.480]   Tell me that story of the company.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:47.120]   In the UK, and I use this as an example because the UK market is much more advanced than the
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   US.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.680]   I'm going to interrupt you, is that because of the legislation changes that took so long
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   in the US to make?
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.240]   Okay, we'll come back to that later, I just wanted to clarify.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.320]   In the UK, it's been going for about five years and it's now worth about 15% of the
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.120]   early stage angel VC seed investment market.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.920]   But this company, the specific company was Monzo, which is a challenger bank, which are
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.720]   doing banking without physical branches, doing everything through the smartphone and through
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   internet technology.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.880]   And they raised their one million pounds, which is about one and a half million US dollars
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.080]   in just 96, not hours, not minutes, but seconds, 96 seconds they raised that money.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.200]   And the reason they were able to do that, and it's a nice headline, but they put a lot
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.000]   of time and preparation into getting that result so that once they hit the go live button,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.480]   people were already queuing up to invest in it.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:57.000]   But the reason that they were so successful was having this community engagement at the
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   core of everything they did and everything they do for the whole time that they were
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   a business.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.960]   So this engaged community building that, it's why crowdfunding succeeds in both the rewards
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.160]   and in the equity side.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.720]   That was a great manifestation of it.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.920]   They had so many people who were fed up with banks.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.120]   I don't know about you, but I don't know too many people who are big fans of the way that
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   banks do things.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.560]   So when you can say that there's a better way and a more user friendly way of doing
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.880]   things, people were keen on that and they could see that the opportunity was there and
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.840]   they blew it out of the park right away.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.400]   How long had they been in business before their equity crowdfunding approach?
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.160]   At the time it was about a year.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.640]   And what did they need the money for?
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.960]   So in their case, it was maybe even less about the money and more about the brand exposure.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.540]   I think specifically they needed it for getting their proper banking license.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.320]   They needed it for sales and marketing, which pretty much every startup has some need for,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.480]   and continued programming and product development too.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.840]   But they could have easily tapped a VC on the shoulder and said, "Hey, we need a million
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.480]   pounds," and they would have gotten the check cut out for them.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.400]   But for them, that wouldn't have been as beneficial because then only one person is engaged with
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.520]   driving the business forward.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.960]   And instead they got hundreds and thousands of people on board instead.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   And what immediately stuck out to me is I don't know what the financial terms were of
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.600]   the investors in that company, but if they wanted exposure, the headline that you just
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   touted of, "We raised a million pounds in 96 seconds," that was probably worth untold
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.040]   multiples of a million pounds in terms of publicity and the business press, et cetera.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:57.080]   So it's almost a strategy, perhaps a radical strategy, for a company to offer terms that
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.800]   are too good to be true in exchange for building a story like that, 96 seconds to a million
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   pounds.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.600]   I mean, it's a marketing exercise.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.840]   A lot of the companies I talk to say that for them it's first and foremost a marketing
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.200]   exercise and not a funding exercise as much.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.360]   The funding is an interesting angle, and of course if you offer most early stage businesses
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.880]   a chance to fund, they're going to take it.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:26.120]   But the marketing exposure can, as you say, Josh, be just as valuable, if not more so.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.200]   I never would have thought of that.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   Amazing.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   So tell me a horror story.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.480]   A horror story, okay.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   So there's one example in my new book which has a company which did two campaigns, one
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.240]   successful and one later on that failed.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:50.960]   The reason that the one failed was they just took on too much at the time.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.240]   Their business was failing, their creditors were knocking on the door, and they needed
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.640]   to change a few other things around with their business.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.760]   So to try to get themselves out of their hole, they thought they'd try another equity crowdfunding
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.000]   round.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.960]   I think the lesson is that for one thing it's going to be really hard when your business
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.000]   is in trouble to tell a positive story.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.600]   Businesses like to see the money used for things like marketing and product development,
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   not repaying creditors.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.680]   But the other problem that this company had was they were trying to do a major product
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.360]   relaunch at the same time, and because their focus was split between the product relaunch
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:43.280]   and the funding campaign, they were able to do neither really successfully.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.960]   It was a tough spot they were in because they couldn't delay the funding round because they
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.720]   needed the money, and they couldn't delay the product relaunch because that needed to
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.800]   happen at the same time.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.400]   So they found themselves just too stretched on resources to do either exercise properly,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.120]   and as a result the company went out of business.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.040]   It doesn't get much more horrible than that.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.800]   I don't want to say anything because I'm so guilty of splitting my attention.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.760]   I know I'm not supposed to, but stories like that are just a warning bell for me myself
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.640]   with my propensity to want to do everything all at once.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   Chase some shiny objects.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.640]   Indeed.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.000]   I have an international audience, but the majority of the audience is based in the United
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.280]   States.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.040]   I know that there have been major frustrations among many investors with how long it took
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.500]   to make some legislative changes and how equity crowdfunding seemed to be accepted in many
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:46.320]   other places, but it was only within a year ago, 2015 sometime, I think.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.920]   So tell us what happened and what the current situation is in the United States, please.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.300]   You're right that there was frustration for a lot of time because the law was actually
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:03.640]   changed back in 2012, but it took the Securities and Exchange Commission until November last
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:10.560]   year before they decided how they were going to implement this change in the law.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.900]   And the rules came into force allowing retail equity crowdfunding, and I'll explain what
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:24.920]   that means in a minute, but these rules came into force in May of this year, 2016, and
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:33.160]   it allows any company to raise up to a million US dollars in any 12-month period, marketing
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.300]   to the general public.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.580]   When I said retail equity crowdfunding before, this is the big change because it's always
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:47.140]   been possible for a startup to seek funding from an accredited or a high net worth investor,
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:52.180]   people who meet a certain wealth test, which is out of reach for most people.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:58.260]   But equity crowdfunding in its purest sense means being able to market to any adult resident
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.620]   who has money in the bank and willing to invest.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.300]   So that came into force in May, and already since then, in the six months as we're recording
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:15.940]   this show, we've seen portals spring up offering this service.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:23.020]   These equity crowdfunding deals are displayed on portals, on websites, so you can actually
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.140]   see these startups and look at their video, look at their business plan before deciding
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.320]   to invest in them.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.120]   And to give you a couple of concrete examples of ones that your listeners can check out,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   the largest is WeFunder, W-E, Funder, and they've done a few pretty interesting deals
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.880]   so far, and they're the largest.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.960]   And another one that I always draw people's attention to is Republic, and Republic has
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.640]   actually spun out of AngelList, which is a company that a lot of people are familiar
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:02.080]   with for early stage funding, but AngelList was restricted to sophisticated and high net
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.640]   worth investors, but this new arm of theirs, Republic, is doing equity crowdfunding to
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   anyone.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.800]   So check those two out if you want to see a bit of a sense of what this is all about
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.120]   and the types of companies that are using it.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.520]   And do you have any measure of the numbers as far as now that, as we record this in November
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.200]   2016, in the last six months, do you have any guess of how many companies have been
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.880]   funded and what the dollars are?
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.120]   It's really difficult to say because there are so many platforms and tracking all of
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.480]   them, well, that's probably another book in itself.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.920]   But what we have seen is a few companies now raise that maximum of a million dollars.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.440]   So there was some concern before the rules came into force that it was going to be too
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.800]   onerous for startups to afford, but that's proven not to be the case, that we've actually
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.000]   seen quite a few deals being done now without being able to put an actual dollar number
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.800]   on it.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:14.160]   It's working, startups are using it, and investors are investing in it.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.640]   Are you seeing new investors go, like for example, do you have any sense of people who
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:27.280]   have never invested in a private company before are going and starting to play around here?
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.160]   Is it filled with more experienced investors?
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.160]   Do you have any sense of who's participating at this point?
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   Sure.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.960]   Yeah, I mean, both are participating.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:44.200]   You'll have larger angel type investors who hang out on these platforms and are screening
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.920]   through the companies that come on.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.020]   But there's also, if a company is bringing their own crowd to a raise, then some of those
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:59.520]   crowd will naturally and inevitably be people who have invested in these types of companies
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.420]   for the first time.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:07.160]   And because of that, I think the platforms are taking the investor education side of
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   things very seriously.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.880]   This is a whole new asset class that people haven't been able to invest in before.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:20.240]   So you've got to, I think you've got to do more than just state the risks in a very legalistic
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.000]   disclaimer that's at the bottom of the page in the fine print that no one reads.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.320]   But you've actually got to do things like run seminars, education sessions about what's
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.760]   involved in this early stage investing.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.960]   Be clear about the opportunities, but be clear about the risks too.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.720]   What's the median investment size that you would guess?
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:49.240]   I would say about a thousand dollars would be median, with a range from down to a hundred
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.240]   dollars in the US, all the way up to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.360]   in some cases.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.680]   But I'd say a thousand or maybe up to five thousand could be typical.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:08.040]   My audience has a lot of people who are committed investors in various ways, some very mainstream,
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.120]   some very non-mainstream.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:17.960]   But probably the primary interest of my audience would be as investors to start looking at
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   companies and start looking at some of these platforms to see if they can get exposure
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.640]   to new and interesting opportunities.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.840]   If you're going to lay out the landscape for an investor and make the case, the benefits,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:37.080]   and also talk about some of the challenges, how would you approach this as an investor?
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:44.440]   So you've got to look at it as a high-risk asset class in most cases.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.240]   The reality is that most of these companies are going to lose all the money that gets
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.480]   put into them.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:56.800]   But like the math that goes into venture capitalists, they are hoping that the winners are going
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.240]   to make up for all the losers.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:06.040]   And for a lot of people who are not from this venture capital background, this type of math
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.880]   where you go in expecting that nine out of ten companies to fail, but for that tenth
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.040]   one to make up for it, it's very different from most investors' approach to things.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.400]   They're all about safety and getting that secure five percent return in the bank or
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.580]   in property or what have you, or in the stock market.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.220]   So you should approach it with money that you can afford to lose.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.920]   So it should be a small part of your portfolio, but nonetheless an interesting one.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:44.980]   Because let's just use some numbers here, let's use some figures so we can get our teeth
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.980]   stuck into it.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.440]   Let's say you've got a net worth of 500K.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.140]   So you own your own house, you are looking around for things to invest in, and you put
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.740]   five percent of your net worth into this new asset class, these VC-like investments.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.980]   So that would be $25,000.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.660]   For that, at that median I talked about of $1,000 each, you could invest in 25 of these
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:18.900]   equity crowdfunded companies and see where it takes you.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:25.260]   If you lose on all 25 of them, then it's not a complete disaster, and I would never tell
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.380]   or advise anyone to put all of their savings into these companies.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.500]   But at the same time, it does add a new flavour to a portfolio.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:42.840]   But I also think that this idea of the way it should work needs to be battle-tested and
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.540]   needs to be thought through.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.260]   It's a nice idea in theory, but does the math actually add up?
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.940]   You get more winners to make up for all these losers.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.660]   So I think you should look at the reputation of the platform itself and what track record
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:07.220]   have they got for providing a place where high-quality companies are to be found.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.140]   Because like in any marketplace, especially one like this where there's a lot of change
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.100]   and a lot of new players sprouting up, there are going to be platforms where there's a
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:24.060]   larger investor audience, and those will probably be where the higher-quality companies tend
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.460]   to congregate.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.460]   So there are all kinds of things which I can get into more, if you like, about how to look
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:37.780]   at these companies and test whether they at least have a chance of being scalable and
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.940]   providing the good math that I'm talking about here.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:46.980]   But don't just assume that because there's this idea that one in 20 will succeed that
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.980]   that's necessarily going to be the case.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.620]   Yeah, this is brand new to me.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:58.580]   I was aware of the term, and I didn't connect it.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.860]   I'm aware that this exists, but you're the first person I've ever spoken to who is involved
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860]   in equity crowdfunding.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:11.740]   It's been one of those things that is on my radar screen, but I've never looked into.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.540]   So I'm thinking about it in terms of my audience.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.180]   OK, maybe this is a great new opportunity.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.220]   And I think it is, because one of my frustrations has been the accreditor investing rules, where
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.140]   I've often wondered, are these rules actually helpful in protecting the general public?
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.980]   Because Joe Q Public is a horrible investor.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:37.720]   Or are these accredited investor rules in the United States a way of preserving the
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.900]   juiciest and most profitable of investment opportunities for the well-connected wealthy
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.900]   elite?
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.020]   I've never fully satisfied that question in my mind.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.020]   I'm curious.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.380]   I'll interrupt myself.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.180]   Do you have an opinion on that question?
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:04.220]   Well, I will say this, that we don't really regulate people's ability to walk into a casino
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.460]   with their whole life savings and put the entire sum of their wealth on the spin of
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.380]   a roulette ball.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:17.660]   So when you look at these companies that are providing real jobs and producing real products
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:26.420]   and services, and we regulate that more than a genuine chance or a genuine gamble, that
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.260]   seems to me to be wrong.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:34.420]   Especially at a time where we've got unprecedented disruption happening in the world, where startups
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:39.220]   are a much hotter thing than they used to be 15 years ago.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:47.420]   The ability for startups to quickly get into new markets and challenge existing incumbents.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   The idea is more important than scale these days.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.380]   So I mean, I think it is a good change.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.700]   As you say, it's not going to be for everyone.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.660]   But I don't think the idea of a blanket ban just to keep everyone out of it is the right
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.660]   way to go.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.100]   So that's the approach that governments around the world have been taking, too.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.340]   That we should be encouraging innovation and we should allow people the option, if they
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.140]   want to, to invest in this new asset class alongside the angels and the wealthy elite,
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.140]   as you call them.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   Right.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.740]   Yeah, I'm presuppositionally committed to liberty.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:31.180]   So anything I can do to remove regulation and expose anything to the market, I'll do
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.180]   that.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.820]   And it's only, and I, instead of starting with saying, well, liberty is dangerous, I
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.380]   start with saying, well, let's start with liberty.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:43.860]   And we need very compelling, overwhelming evidence to start imposing restrictions.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.380]   So I'm happy about this change.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.780]   But it also is going to be meeting a marketplace of people who are relatively ill-equipped.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:57.020]   I come from a background of working as a professional financial advisor, and I've seen firsthand
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:03.740]   just how ill-equipped the average person is to deal in well-regulated, well-researched,
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.100]   very efficient financial markets.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.420]   Now we move into something like this, and immediately I think, how on earth would I
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.260]   advise somebody to do it?
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.660]   Let me give a few examples from my audience.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.340]   I pulled up the front page of wefunder.com, and here would be just some examples of the
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.620]   companies that are listed right on the front page.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.580]   Vet Pronto, which does on-demand house call veterinarians.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.580]   Great idea.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.620]   I just think, how would I know even how to approach that as an investor?
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.100]   How would I know how to work that out?
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.620]   I'd love to see that, but how would we test the market, et cetera?
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.140]   Liquid Piston, the first wholly new combustion engine or cycle in 85 plus years.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.460]   Airbits, decentralized data security platform to thwart hackers.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.900]   Barrows Intense, an award-winning ginger liqueur, handmade in Brooklyn.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:57.340]   Maestro Conference, a mission-driven technology platform for leaders making global impact.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:03.100]   Mobodexter, back-end software platform makes it easy to launch any IoT company.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.660]   Paint Blue Brewing Company, the only craft microbrewery in Mobile, Alabama.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:13.420]   Hawaii Cider Company, Hawaii's first locally grown, locally produced cider company.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.500]   Nice, frozen cocktails.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:21.900]   I see a lot of frozen cocktails from superstar DJs in Grosso, Axwell, and Alesso.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.580]   Here's a smart electric bicycle one, a scale that scans your body in 3D.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.100]   Bloomery, and more award-winning farm-fresh liqueurs.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   Here's breweries.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.500]   I won't keep reading, but monkey rum?
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500]   I guess alcohol.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.740]   I'm sensing a theme here of who's working well right now.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.740]   Right.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.100]   I mean, those sorts of, well, yeah, alcohol.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.980]   Everyone knows what alcohol is and they understand the business.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:55.620]   So I guess when you're weighing that up against some new combustion engine, then it's a little
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.260]   easier for the average person to understand.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.300]   I just wonder where to start because generally as an investor, you want to invest in what
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.580]   you know, but I don't know how you get there here.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.900]   Well, I mean, take a step back, though.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.260]   What is the average person's 401k invested in?
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.460]   It's in stocks and bonds.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.460]   Agreed.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:26.860]   I bet that most people don't have a clue about all these companies and their portfolios either.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:33.740]   So yeah, we sort of look at this new asset class and we say we don't really understand
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.740]   these companies.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.220]   But the status quo in many cases, we don't really understand either.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.700]   So I think you've got to take a diversified approach to it like you do with all asset
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:50.660]   classes that you kind of acknowledge your ignorance in a way and you say, well, I'm
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:59.420]   going to take a portion, not all, of my portfolio and put it into these companies that seem
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.980]   like they might have potential, do my background on each of them.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:10.100]   But, you know, there's no products out there or easy way to invest, for example, in an
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.740]   ETF or through a financial advisor who's going to do this for you.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.860]   It's direct investing.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:23.060]   So, you know, really it's making people more responsible for their own financial education.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.960]   You can't really, if you want to play in this space, you can't just turn this over to somebody.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.780]   You've got to make your own choices.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:35.540]   And that in itself, I think, is a pretty interesting development because you have this seen as
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.860]   a force for people increasing their financial education and taking more responsibility for
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.820]   the companies in which their own money is being put.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:52.820]   What are the financial disclosure methodology?
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.060]   I'm sitting here as we're talking.
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:00.020]   So here's one I clicked on called Invest in Tampon Tribe.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:05.080]   Company here is manufacturing organic 100% cotton tampon and pad subscription services.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:11.980]   So this is like a fascinating type of business model to me because among the crunchy people,
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.600]   of which my wife and I are crunchy people in some ways, among the crunchy people, the
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.840]   use of cloth related feminine hygiene products is much more, is well known and most people
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.220]   are aware of it.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.860]   But yet this faces all the same problems in the marketplace.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.660]   Cloth diapers have been around forever and yet pampers and huggies and whatnot still
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.780]   have a much bigger market share.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.420]   So I've thought about this marketplace.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.420]   I'm aware of it.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:47.020]   I have, weirdly enough, I have information on how this works because I know the people.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.860]   But I immediately come and think, "Okay, what's going to be different about this company?
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.860]   How am I going to prove that they're going to be able to execute?"
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.040]   I'm looking at all their sales material here.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   It's not about the product.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.940]   It's going to be about the execution because the product, anybody could rip off this product
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.260]   and create something exactly similar.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:11.500]   So how would, what do they have to submit and how do I assess that as a potential investor
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.980]   in order to know if this is a good investment for me?
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.040]   Well, they'll need to prepare a business plan.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.740]   So you'll be reading through that and when you're reading business plans, there's no
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.260]   other way to do it than to read it and see if it makes sense to you.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:36.140]   And look at the valuation they're asking for and look at what similar companies have been
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.780]   funded for.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.600]   So again, when you're making these direct investments, this is your job.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.380]   It's not the job of the ETF manager and it's not the job of your financial advisor.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.940]   You've actually got to engage your own brain to decide whether it's a good company to invest
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.020]   in or not.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.220]   And for these small amounts, it's hard work.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.340]   And you've got to choose between this one and the dozen or so others that you've already
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.500]   mentioned that are on their site.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   So how do you do that in an efficient way?
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:11.260]   And I think one way to do that is look at who the other investors are in the offer.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:17.740]   So in many cases, and on many crowdfunding sites, you can see if they've got a, what
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.080]   they call a lead investor.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:24.100]   So this is someone who has invested in these types of businesses before.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.860]   They've worked with this company to decide on what the valuation should be.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.220]   And they've put their own money behind that.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:37.300]   So you as a member of the crowd can follow along and invest with the angels.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:43.260]   I mean, I think in investing there's always a certain degree of outsourcing of the mental
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.060]   work that we end up doing.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.020]   And this has some negative implications, but I think it can also have some positive ones
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:55.740]   that if you can look at a company and say, hey, this company is being backed by this
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:02.420]   really smart guy or woman who has got in there, got their hands dirty on the business model
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:08.460]   and decided to back it with their own funds, then the crowd is then following a more rational
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.620]   decision than would be otherwise the case.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:20.900]   So look, the other disclosure requirements, they will be required, I think, in the US
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.780]   to disclose what they ultimately do spend the money on.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.940]   So they'll be saying in their business plan as a forecast, we think we'll spend it on
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:29.940]   X, Y, and Z.
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.900]   Well, in 12 months time, they'll need to report back on whether they have spent it on X, Y,
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.900]   and Z.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.460]   So there's some accountability there as well.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.660]   What is the secondary market like?
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:46.340]   Major benefit to investing in publicly traded stocks is, yeah, I might not have a great
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.380]   inside advantage, but this is a healthy market where at any point in time I can click sell
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.020]   and you can sell any publicly traded stock with a click of the mouse at some price.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:02.260]   What's the secondary market like for an investment that I make in a company like this?
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.620]   In a word, there's not one.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:10.100]   People are looking to invest at the same terms as angel investors do, which is that your
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:16.700]   money is going to be locked up for three, five, maybe even seven or so years until there's
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:23.500]   what they call a liquidity event where the company is sold or ends up being big enough
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.380]   to justify listing on the public market.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.060]   There have been some attempts to set up a secondary market for equity crowdfunded companies,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:36.380]   but the problem you get is that there's no market that develops.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:41.940]   And in fact, even some companies that do full scale IPOs at the low end end up suffering
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:49.420]   from this low liquidity problem that even though ostensibly they're on the market, if
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.900]   your company is only worth $20 million or something, there's just not going to be that
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:01.940]   amount of people who are willing to meet to buy and sell frequently for a reasonable price
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   to be discovered.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.660]   And it would be even more so the case for equity crowdfunding, which is an even earlier
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.940]   stage of development.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:15.900]   So you'd end up, if there was one, a price which is very one off and not really a true
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.220]   reflection of the company.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.980]   If there was a transaction, it would probably be someone who invested their money and then
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.620]   needs to get out for some reason.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.860]   They're selling under duress and then that makes all the other investors panic and that's
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.980]   just not a good thing for the company that's raising.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.620]   So yeah, really there's no secondary market.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.300]   Every asset class has different characteristics.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.060]   One benefit of the stock market is it's highly liquid.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.340]   There are disadvantages to the stock market as well.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.740]   And one disadvantage of equity crowdfunding and to these private companies is you don't
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.900]   really get liquidity.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.900]   Which goes back to the question of looking for a unicorn and the one out of ten or one
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.660]   out of twenty expectation of success.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.900]   It's just a completely different mindset where you recognize that the vast majority of my
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.380]   investments are going to become worthless.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:17.300]   It's much more akin to taking an educated gamble than it is to making an educated investment.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:24.380]   Of course, I don't want to completely mischaracterize it, but there are so many forces that can
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:32.060]   play and many of these companies are going to lack what they call a moat.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.860]   When I'm reading this, I'm just looking at these companies that are here.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:42.540]   There's nothing particularly unique about having an award-winning barrel-aged rum company
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.940]   or there's nothing particularly unique about this farm fresh liqueur.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:53.940]   It just simply has a brand and it's all a matter of the skill of even this tampon tribe
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.940]   company.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:01.300]   This is all going to be a matter of branding and the ability to negotiate the channels
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:07.780]   of sales to go quickly and make substantial increases through applying marketing expertise.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.420]   It's not product related in other words.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.700]   At least with many of these companies, it's going to be based upon the experience and
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:21.460]   ability of the company founders to generate PR and buzz for their product.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.460]   Exactly right.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:28.900]   For those types of companies you've just mentioned, you do as an investor have the option to find
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:35.140]   such a company on the stock market if liquidity is important to you and buy that type of more
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.420]   advanced company.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.820]   But you're not getting in at that really early stage where there is the potential for that
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.980]   much more upside.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:51.180]   You could go ahead and buy stock in Empire Bush or in InBev, but you're going to face
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.700]   the problem that it's going to be very hard for that company to increase in value by two
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:00.860]   times or ten times or twenty times because they're already all over the world.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.100]   But yeah, it's just a different game you're playing for sure.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:10.980]   Because in a larger market, if you're trying to play a trend, there are many ways to play
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.540]   a trend, but generally if you're playing a trend, you're investing in such a way that
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.260]   you want to follow the trend and then sell out.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.980]   Well, you can't really do that here.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:24.580]   So yes, I'm looking at this Tampon Tribe one just as an example.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.700]   The trend is towards natural and organic.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.460]   The trend is toward subscription services.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.380]   That's one of the things they're trying to pursue.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.900]   So yes, there are these trends, but that trend isn't going to connect over to my investment
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.460]   because all I care about is how many are we actually moving and I want to be able to sell
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.140]   out at the end of the trend.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.580]   So fascinating.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:53.460]   One question, Nathan, where my mind immediately went, are you aware of anybody who is building
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:40:01.540]   platforms for geographic localities with this type of approach yet?
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.500]   So you mean a region specific crowdfunding platform?
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.500]   Right.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.740]   Because that's a huge, that to me seems like a better fit.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.180]   I'm involved here in West Palm Beach, Florida where I live.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:17.180]   I'm involved very loosely with a couple of the startup, with some of the local startup
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:25.580]   community and I see it as much more valuable to be able to use digital technology to connect
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:31.040]   people in a location because I don't have any trust or any real ability to personally
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.220]   vet somebody on WeFunder who's on the other side of the country.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:40.080]   I'm stuck limited to their pretty pictures and their very carefully composed text.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   But if somebody were in my town and this were built upon some of that, whether it's Thousand
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:50.260]   Cups or some of the local startup communities, et cetera, this type of approach to me seems
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.380]   to have huge benefit in the local area because now we could take some businesses that need
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:03.180]   funding but because those businesses are based upon the local economy, which we can measure
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.220]   the pulse of based upon our local connections, to me that would seem to be a really powerful
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:15.020]   way to pull this together and I as an investor would love to see something like this.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.960]   Am I off base or does that seem helpful to you?
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.360]   I think what you're saying is definitely an approach that some platforms are taking.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.560]   Every platform has a different philosophy on a number of things, but one of those is
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   geography.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.160]   So some of them are trying to be global.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.240]   Very difficult to do global given that you have to deal with the different securities
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.600]   regulation in every single country, which is why we don't have a Kickstarter or an Indiegogo
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.080]   with equity crowdfunding yet.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:50.640]   We've just got lots of different nationwide markets.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.840]   But yeah, as well, some of them are taking more of a community finance approach where
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:01.200]   it's more about funding things that are specific to the region and the US is a big place, so
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:07.800]   there's room to do that where you can connect more closely with the local startup incubators,
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.000]   with the chambers of commerce in the different cities that you're around.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.520]   I mean, in Europe we see actually that the platforms which have been more successful
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:25.720]   have been the ones that have integrated themselves very tightly into the local area.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:30.000]   Each country in Europe is a lot smaller and in total Europe is about the size of the US.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:38.760]   So what there probably is an opportunity for are for platforms to develop in each of San
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   Francisco or New York or in Florida or in Texas or all these places where entrepreneurialism
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:51.520]   is strong, but because if you're more on the ground and more able to plug into those existing
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.600]   networks it can work.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.200]   But there will be also some who try to be nationwide.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.320]   So yeah, it's one approach, but it's not the only approach.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.120]   I think it's got exciting opportunities and of course somebody can swindle you face to
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.400]   face just as well as somebody can swindle you on the internet, but we still tend to
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.560]   trust more those who we can see and measure and touch with our hands and speak to with
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.880]   our voices and observe and kind of test the mettle of the man.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.240]   So wow, how interesting.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:27.080]   Nathan, what kind of questions should I be asking you that I haven't thought of?
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.000]   Oh, gee.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.320]   You should, because your listeners are mostly interested in the investing side of it rather
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:44.080]   than the start-up side of it, maybe I can talk a little about how to look at an individual
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:51.920]   investment and decide some of the basics as to whether they've got the basics covered.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.720]   So you should be looking for businesses which have scalability potential.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:07.600]   I mean, it can be used to fund these very – like you called out, I think, the alcohol
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.720]   companies which don't really have a moat around them.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.840]   So for me, I think equity crowdfunding is a very good way for those companies to fund,
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.720]   but it might not be such a good way for investors to invest.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:26.080]   So I'd be looking for companies that do at least have some chance of 10x, 25x, 100x return.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.280]   Because if they don't have that, then the math is never going to work, even if you're
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.920]   successful.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:37.760]   And you should be looking for a platform with the investor protections in place.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:45.280]   So there are things in the VC community called anti-dilution rights, where if you're an investor
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:55.480]   early on in a company, you want the ability to participate in follow-on funding rounds
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:01.040]   so that someone in the future doesn't come along and put more money in, reducing your
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.280]   stake from – to use round numbers.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:09.240]   Let's say you put in a stake early that gave you 5%, and then two years later you think
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.160]   you've made a lot of money, but one of the company founder's mates just comes in and
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.880]   puts in a whole lot of money with you not being allowed to participate, which reduces
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.280]   your stake down to 1%.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.320]   So you want to definitely be aware of that, and most of the platforms are very strong
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.640]   on that, but some are less strong than others.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:36.520]   And I think as well you should be doing what you said in terms of trying to get beyond
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:42.600]   just the computer screen and the online aspect of it.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.520]   Just because crowdfunding is done online doesn't mean you can't pick up the phone and talk
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.900]   to these founders who are asking for your money.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.320]   After all, it's your money and they need to convince you of whether they're worthy
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   of it or not.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.480]   So definitely ask for business plans, ask lots of questions, ask the hard questions
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.280]   that you think they're not going to be comfortable with, and through that way you'll gain more
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.640]   confidence in the team that you're ultimately looking to back.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.120]   I think people often underestimate how accessible and available entrepreneurs are.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:21.800]   I worked closely with one company that was going through the rounds of VC funding, and
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.440]   what was remarkable, it was a bootstrap story.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.840]   The founder started it off just kind of as a fun project, all of a sudden realized the
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.600]   market potential, bootstrapped his way through it.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   It was a digital technology company.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:41.040]   And systematically worked, worked, worked, and then they came to that point where they
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:47.760]   needed funding, and they had worked their way through investments from friends and family,
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   etc.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.280]   But it was at a stage where the company had huge potential.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.400]   It had potential of tens of millions of dollars of revenue.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.360]   But what the founder needed was $5,000 so that he could make his personal rent payments
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.480]   for the next two months and keep things going.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:12.280]   And working with them and kind of watching that, I learned how impactful a few thousand
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:18.480]   dollar investment can be at the right stage of a company, where you see a company where
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.080]   there is a market potential, and particularly with this one, because it was based around
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.280]   digital technology, it was very expandable.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:32.760]   And the heavy work was up front in building the infrastructure, in setting and doing the
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.240]   coding, and then the profit was on the back end.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.800]   The few thousand dollars spoke very, very heavily for just an ordinary person.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:47.860]   And the few thousand dollars is what was enabling the founder to systematically go and meet
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:52.840]   with the VCs and the VC firms and bring in the six and seven figure checks, which ultimately
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.160]   happened.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.800]   And in that case, the company has gone on to do extraordinarily well, and it has been
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.640]   a winner for all of the investors.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.320]   There was a way for an investor to be involved at every stage.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.800]   In hindsight, I was too young and green at the time to be confident in kicking in any
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   money.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.880]   But I learned from that experience, I'm so grateful for it, and I realized that I should
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:25.800]   be more proactive, and that I always wanted to keep some money on the side that was ready
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:33.520]   to invest into risky, high risk of loss, but potential of return investments.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:39.920]   And I had to change my mindset, but the founder was available, and the opportunities were
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   there.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.120]   I've heard other stories from listeners in my audience who similar things, they didn't
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.680]   realize how much a few thousand dollar or $5,000 investment would have meant to somebody
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.080]   at that right point in time.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:59.120]   They never picked up the phone, made the phone call, and in hindsight, they kicked themselves.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.960]   Because then later, they came in too late, where the person needed a few million dollars
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.280]   to hire 10 people, now all of a sudden it was too late.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.080]   So picking up the phone can be a good way to figure out the life cycle of a company,
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.080]   and don't be scared to research it.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.000]   Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.240]   Founders are very accessible when they're asking for money, and wouldn't we all have
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:26.200]   liked to have been the person who gave Mark Zuckerberg his first $5,000 when he needed
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   it?
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   Indeed, indeed.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.520]   But it did convince me that there is a way to invest at just about any scale, and maybe
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.760]   this is one of those scales.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:40.400]   Of course, you need to know that the company can make that transition, because, well, you
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.520]   need to know that there are opportunities.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:50.440]   Nathan, coming back as we wrap up here, coming back to the entrepreneur, I didn't mean to
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:56.000]   discount the value, because I actually could see a lot of benefit for an entrepreneur of
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.240]   using an equity crown funding site, because they can avoid, as I understand it, and tell
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.360]   me if this is right or wrong, but one of the major benefits would be if I've got a company
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:12.860]   that has been doing well, and I need funding, but I don't want to take some of the control,
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:16.720]   I don't need the benefits of working with a VC who's going to help me, or a partner
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.680]   who's going to help me with connections, I'm not trying to get those benefits, I just need
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:26.240]   funding, and I don't want to do it with loans, because I don't want the payback terms, I
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.200]   don't want to be saddled with the obligation.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:36.520]   But I'm not big enough to go and hire an investment bank to do a public offering, or to work with
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:40.280]   accredited investors who can't wake up in the morning.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.400]   For many people, if they were to invest less than a million dollars, it's not worth their
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.100]   time, because they've got such a huge portfolio they're trying to handle.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:53.720]   But this does seem to be a very possibly effective way, especially for somebody in the local
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   market, to use a website, but then use the excitement in the local market where people
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.900]   are going to have a connection with their brand.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.160]   Because even though I, sitting here in West Palm Beach, have no interest in investing
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:13.080]   in this Austin, or the only craft microbrewery in Mobile, Alabama, if I were with the Haint
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:18.720]   Blue Brewing Company in Mobile, Alabama, I know without a question that I could take
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:27.200]   that and go in my local market, and I could do my rounds of marketing, and I could use
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.360]   this as a simple way for me to attract, at a $100 minimum investment, these people have
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:40.080]   raised $200,000 here from 190 investors, I can go around and in my local community, I
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:46.300]   can solicit the investors at a small level, and connect and just simply use these crowdfunding
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:54.160]   sources as a way for me to facilitate the sale of some of my company in exchange for
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.360]   equity.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.100]   So I don't want to diminish how, as a local business person, how valuable I think this
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.100]   can be.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.520]   Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:10.640]   I think the great thing about it is that it fills this funding gap between startups and
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:17.480]   entrepreneurs who have grown beyond the scale that they can fund with their own personal
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:23.320]   resources, or those of friends and family around them, but are still too small for the
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:29.660]   IPO market, or for venture capital, who, as you say, tend to want to invest much larger
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.520]   amounts in fewer companies.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:38.120]   And the ability to get people to pay attention to you, there needs to be some reason for
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.680]   that, and having a funding round going on which is open to them is a great way to get
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:49.280]   media involved, to get the community of customers and suppliers around you on board, and to
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.640]   expand your network too by exposing yourself through these online platforms to a whole
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.040]   new audience.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.960]   So it's a really interesting way for startups and growing companies to raise funding, absolutely.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:04.320]   I can see it, even in some of my own project ideas and business ideas.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.820]   I'm happy to be thinking about this and filtering this in.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.720]   For those who are looking at investment, here are the ideas, and I'll give you the last
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.400]   word in terms of closing advice, and then I want you to talk about your company and
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.440]   your book and any services that you have.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.240]   But for those who are looking to invest, it would seem to me, if I were an investor and
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:31.840]   I wanted to factor this in, I would try to do two things.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:38.680]   I would try to be focused on an area of expertise and be somewhat agnostic about the platform
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.480]   I'm choosing to invest.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:48.720]   So if I'm investing in beer companies, I'm going to be paying attention to Anheuser-Busch,
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.980]   and I'm going to be paying attention to the local guy down the street who I went ahead
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:57.080]   and just privately made an investment deal with him, and I'm just going to be looking
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:04.660]   at a website like this and factoring in the ability for me to reach new companies and
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.620]   new investment opportunities through this platform.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.240]   The idea is I'm not going to a platform like this and saying, "Well, this is my plan."
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:18.320]   No, my plan is that I'm investing in a sector of the market, and I'm doing that on whatever
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   platform I find to do that, S&P 500, my own business, or a platform like this.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:30.160]   And so I think this should be something that we keep in mind when we're interested and
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.400]   we have an investment idea, a thesis, as they say, that we want to follow through or an
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.800]   approach, something that we're trying to pursue.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:45.680]   Or I think that if you are looking for a way to supplement it, that you would want to use
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:51.160]   this and just simply filter very carefully based upon your criteria and use it as a way
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:56.400]   to learn some of the skills of being a VC or angel investor.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.680]   And so there's where you're going to be looking and saying, "Okay, I'm going to walk away
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:05.200]   from this brewery because this brewery doesn't have any opportunity to 30X my money in the
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.240]   coming years.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.320]   But over here, there's this little interesting technology idea that somebody has put on here,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:17.640]   and let me go ahead and research that and use this as a way for me to learn the business,
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.680]   perhaps even a cheap way for me to learn the business and learn the emotions of it while
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:26.200]   preparing for my bigger role in angel investing or working in my local investment club."
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.600]   So those are just two ideas that I think would have a lot of value on this.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.800]   Does those seem reasonable approaches to you?
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:38.360]   Yeah, I think investing in things that you already understand well is definitely a good
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.280]   approach to be taking.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.600]   So if you're from a beer background, we keep coming back to this beer example.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.280]   Everyone, you can relate to it.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.440]   We all get the beer business.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.440]   I think so.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:55.360]   If that's your background, then you're much better equipped to evaluate markets and risks
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.160]   and business plans in that sector.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.560]   So that's a great place to start.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.960]   And yeah, in terms of education, I think it's a great point you make too.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:12.200]   When people have kids or they're trying to get their own family more interested in investing
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.840]   and more responsible for their own money, a great thing to do is to get them to buy
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.520]   a couple of stocks just so they can see how it's working.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.960]   So if you're looking at becoming more involved in angel investing yourself, then getting
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.480]   a couple of crowdfunding offers as investments under your belt is a great way to get started.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:37.080]   And so especially if you're in a place where one of these companies is, it's great to say
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.800]   for kids, and I think it's fantastic and I intend to do it with my kids, "Oh, look, we're
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.280]   buying you this share of stock."
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.400]   It's great to be able to do that.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.520]   A lot of people say, "Oh, I'm going to choose Disney," or, "My wife's grandparents bought
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.400]   them all the share of Coca-Cola stock."
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:57.680]   But I feel like that lesson, because it's often restricted to the annual investment
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:04.000]   report, the annual reports, and it's very immaterial to a kid.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.120]   But when you have something that is local, perhaps a local business, if there's something
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:14.880]   here, and this is this Austin company, well, for a hundred bucks, I'll buy into that just
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.920]   to be able to say, "Hey, let's go down and look at that company and let's use this as
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.760]   a way of actually being able to see it."
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.200]   Kids will relate to it from a tangible perspective.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:31.080]   I'm going to be searching some of these websites for things in my area for that benefit in
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.720]   and of itself.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.180]   I'm most intrigued, Nathan, as we wrap up, with your business, because to me it seems
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:43.400]   like you've got the one selling shovels to gold diggers, which I think is great.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.760]   That's always the business that I want to be in.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.240]   I don't want to be a part of the gold rush in terms of out searching for gold.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.840]   I want to be the person selling shovels to the prospectors.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:58.280]   So tell us about your business and tell my audience any follow-up that you'd like them
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:02.720]   to take, information, who would be a good fit for you from a client perspective, and
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.600]   who would be a good fit for reading your book?
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:10.120]   Well, I think the good fit for a client and for reading the book are pretty much the same
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   person.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.920]   I've written this book, Equity Crowdfunding, The Complete Guide for Startups and Growing
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   Companies.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:24.840]   I'm not too creative with the title, I have to say, but it's aimed at companies that are
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:31.840]   looking for more than 50 grand, less than a million in the US, but less than 5 million
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:37.560]   euros in the European Union, because there's different limits at play there, who have a
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:44.920]   business that they need funding for and they want to know more about equity crowdfunding.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.900]   So I can step them through the process with one-on-one coaching calls.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:56.120]   We can work out which platform is going to be right for them based on their specific
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.640]   objectives, work out a valuation that's going to be reasonable and accepted by the investment
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:07.340]   community, form a marketing plan that they can go away and execute on to ultimately drive
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:12.720]   people to their offer page and invest, and to be well prepared for life as a company
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.480]   with all these new investors in.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.880]   So it's helping, it's hand-holding along the way, and the book is a great place to start
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.000]   if you want to know more.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.280]   It's available on Amazon now.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.980]   And if you're looking at investing in these companies, another thing that I'd encourage
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:34.480]   your readers to do would be to go to my site and you can actually download a free chapter
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.480]   from my webpage.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:39.180]   If you sign up to the email list, I'll send that to you.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:46.200]   And I think that free chapter actually has a bit of a word on what investors' motivations
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:51.400]   are for investing in this new equity crowdfunding phenomenon, because it's interesting and I
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:55.720]   think it's important even as a company too to understand what investors' motivations
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.880]   are because they're ultimately going to be along with you for a long time on your ride.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.600]   And the webpage that you want my listeners to go to is assembleadvisory.com?
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.640]   Yeah, and assembleadvisory.com/book.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.800]   We'll talk all about the book and show you how to opt in for that free sample chapter
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   too.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   Great.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   Well Nathan, this has been exciting.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.160]   I apologize to you that even at the beginning I wasn't steering us in the right direction,
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.720]   but you got my creative juices going and I will be watching this intensely.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.080]   I'm embarrassed that I'm behind the eight ball already where I haven't been paying attention
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.600]   to this market, but you definitely got me excited in today's interview.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.000]   And I hope that many of my listeners, I know many of my listeners will benefit both as
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.920]   investors and as entrepreneurs.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   Thank you for coming on the show.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:01:01.440]   It's been my pleasure and thanks for having me.
