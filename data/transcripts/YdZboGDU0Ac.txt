[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   what are some of the ways that someone can actually become more aware of that finite nature of time?
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.560]   I think the first thing that people need to do is simply ask themselves a set of questions around
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.400]   time as an asset. Questions that sort of frame up the fact that time is a valuable asset in
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.360]   their life and one that is terrifyingly finite and impermanent. So each section of the book is
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.600]   framed around one big question. The big question in time wealth is how many moments do you have
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.920]   remaining with the people you love? And we talked about this last time in the context of those
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.600]   charts. These short windows of time during which these people occupy your life. They are very finite
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.880]   and we don't think about that enough in the moment. We think about it at the end once it's too late.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.520]   Time has this funny nature where for most people you think about it not at all until the very end
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.200]   when it's the only thing you think about but then it's too late. You can't do anything about it.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.920]   Asking yourself those questions in the present along the way is the path to actually developing
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.380]   more awareness about that time, about the fact that it is finite.
