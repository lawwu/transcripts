[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.820]   This month at DesiringGod.org,
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.520]   we are celebrating 31 personalities
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.240]   behind the Protestant Reformation
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960]   in a series called Here We Stand,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.680]   31 Heroes of the Reformation.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.940]   Each day through the month of October,
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.600]   we're publishing a brief character sketch
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.360]   of a personality in the Reformation,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.740]   a little five to seven minute episode of audio.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.160]   It's real easy to catch up
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.920]   if you're just hearing about it now.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500]   You can find more details on the site
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.260]   at DesiringGod.org/stand.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080]   Well, today on the podcast,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.560]   we talk about longer book length biographies.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.640]   And the question comes to us from a listener named Dylan.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.160]   Pastor John, in light of 2017 being the 500th anniversary
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.680]   of the Protestant Reformation,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.240]   and you being a biographer of several of the Reformers,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.600]   what book length Reformation biographies
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.440]   would be great to read, and why would you read them?
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.540]   - This morning, I got up early before my wife was awake,
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.460]   and to keep from waking her up,
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.460]   I grabbed all my clothes and went into the next room.
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.100]   And that's the room where all my biographies are shelved.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.220]   I have a separate room.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700]   And there, I didn't know this question was coming.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.700]   I just sat there amazed at the wonderful gift from God
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.620]   of biographies.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.500]   I think there are probably 40 feet of shelf space
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.100]   filled with biographies in that room.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.260]   So I love this question.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.260]   I think good biographies are spiritually, historically,
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.640]   theologically, psychologically,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   the best way to expose ourselves to times and people
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   and thinking outside our own head.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.600]   And it seems to me the Bible virtually commands us
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.360]   to give ourselves to biography,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   at least to the lives of the living, if not the dead,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.220]   because not only do we have
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.760]   the great 11th chapter of Hebrews,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.240]   which inspires us with all the heroes of the faith,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   but we have that amazing statement
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   in Philippians 3, 17, "Brothers, join in imitating me
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.160]   "and fix your eyes on those who walk
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.540]   "according to the example you have in us."
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.920]   That's amazing.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Fix your eyes on people whose lives are shaped
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.480]   by the apostolic example.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.040]   Wow, what a happy command.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   I love it.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.160]   I'm so glad I've been commanded to do that.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.640]   So amen to this question.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.480]   Here goes.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.320]   I have not read, everybody knows I'm not a fast reader,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.360]   I've not read a lot of biographies of the Reformers,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.480]   but I'll mention the few that I've loved
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.200]   and been helped by.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.640]   Martin Luther, Roland Bainton's old biography,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   "Here I Stand," is still in print,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   still riveting in the way it tells the story.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.160]   I read it 40 years ago,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.240]   and so I can't remember the details,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.440]   but I commend it as a good balance
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   between scholarship and popular understandability and appeal.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.220]   A great story from Roland Bainton,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.840]   B-A-I-N-T-O-N.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.520]   The biography I leaned on most in my lecture on Luther
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.320]   was Heiko Obermann.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.440]   The title is "Luther, Man Between God and the Devil,"
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.360]   published in German in 1982, and now in English.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.560]   And one of the things that makes a great biography
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   is that the author has the spiritual sensitivities
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.940]   that enable him to grasp the heart
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.880]   of what a man or a woman stood for.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.380]   Here's an example.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.180]   It's a quote from Heiko Obermann.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.980]   "A sense of the mysterium tremendum
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.180]   "of the holiness of God was to be characteristic
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.980]   "of Luther throughout his life.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.940]   "It prevented pious routine
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.100]   "from creeping into his relations with God,
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.260]   "and kept his Bible studies, prayers,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.400]   "and reading of the Mass from declining
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.540]   "into a mechanical matter of course.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.840]   "His ultimate concern in all these
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   "is the encounter with the living God."
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.880]   And I said, "That's it.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   "That's it.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   "That's what makes a life worthy of focusing on.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   "I want to find a man who's devoted
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.180]   "to encountering the living God
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.040]   "through his peculiar personality,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.180]   "and a biographer who can smell that
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.900]   "and draw that out and make us tremble with Luther.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.120]   "That's a good biography."
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.220]   John Calvin, I'm just gonna commend
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.540]   that excellent little short introductory biography
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.260]   by T.H.L. Parker, who recently passed away.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.260]   Before he did, we at Desiring God contacted him in Britain
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.460]   and asked permission to take his little 120-page biography
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.820]   called "Portrait of Calvin"
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.100]   and reissue it through Desiring God
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.100]   with our own imprint on it attributed to him.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.980]   It's not under copyright anymore from anybody.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.460]   And put our own foreword in it
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.660]   and make it available free online.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.620]   And he was thrilled.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.340]   He let us do it.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.360]   And so at Desiring God's website, in the book section,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.220]   you can find "A Portrait of Calvin."
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.700]   You just click on it and download the PDF
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.700]   and you'll have 120 pages for your own introduction.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.940]   And I wanted it to, I wanted to get it back in print
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.900]   because it was the first introduction I had to Calvin.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.660]   And I remember how moving it was and how manageable.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.220]   And I think there's just hundreds of people
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.860]   who would like a three-hour introduction to Calvin
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.620]   instead of a 40-hour commitment with some 500-page book.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.660]   And so there it is.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.220]   And I think it's still at Amazon for a couple of dollars
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.140]   if you'd like to read the paper.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.100]   My favorite biography of all the Reformers
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.080]   is David Daniel's biography of William Tyndale.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.240]   400 pages long, sounds big.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.660]   I know, I just made a case for a little one.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.940]   This one's big and it's thorough,
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.940]   but it's absolutely not dull and not over your head.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.260]   Tyndale was the English Reformer
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.820]   who put the New Testament into English
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.460]   from the Greek for the first time.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.700]   And he paid for it with his life.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.940]   In fact, one of the terrible revelations of this book
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.940]   that made it so valuable was the firsthand grisly evidence
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.700]   of how church leaders professing Christians
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.420]   from the Roman church actually killed people
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.940]   for reading the Bible in English.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.540]   I mean, just think of it.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.940]   That was considered so evil,
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.740]   it was worthy of being burned alive.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.060]   I mean, it's incomprehensible.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.060]   We need to be taken back into moments like that in history.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.420]   Now, let me end by cheating.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.740]   I'm gonna go way back before the Reformation
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.440]   and 200 years after and mention two more.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.380]   Peter Brown's biography of St. Augustine,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.680]   I guess you should say it,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.540]   because Augustine was quoted by the Reformers
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.860]   more than anybody outside the Bible.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.340]   Brown tells a great story.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.900]   And I would put his biography right up there
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.140]   with Danielle's on Tyndale.
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.580]   So Peter Brown on Augustine.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.780]   And the last thing would be Jonathan Edwards,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.020]   gotta do it, 200 years after the Reformation.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.580]   And yet Edwards was, most people would agree,
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.580]   who know was the greatest Reformation representative
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.460]   that America has ever produced.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.460]   So George Marsden's big or little distilled biography,
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.860]   Marsden, M-A-R-S-D-E-N,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.540]   George Marsden's biography of Jonathan Edwards.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.800]   And there are, of course, so many more,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.260]   many that I have not read, some that I have,
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.700]   but to quote the voice of Augustine
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.100]   that he heard in his ear,
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.620]   I guess the voice of the God or the little children
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.540]   who were calling out over the wall, "Take up and read."
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.380]   - Amen.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.780]   Reformation history is not merely a seasonal reading thing,
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.380]   but a really lifelong study.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.380]   And this list will get any reader off to a very good start
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.660]   as they put together their own 40 feet of book space
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.820]   dedicated to biographies.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.900]   And thank you for listening
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.940]   and making the podcast a part of your day.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.700]   And speaking of Reformation biographies,
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.580]   we have been celebrating many of these voices
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.300]   at Desiring God in a daily series titled,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   "Here We Stand, 31 Heroes of the Reformation."
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.400]   It's a series of articles and also a podcast
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.420]   of five to seven minutes each.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.140]   Each day through the month of October,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.980]   we are publishing these very brief daily character sketches
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.300]   of a personality in the Reformation.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.340]   You can find out more details.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.420]   You can find the written piece
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.460]   and you can find links to the podcast
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.180]   at desiringgod.org/stand.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.020]   You'll wanna check it out.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.180]   There's plenty of time to catch up.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.860]   We started on the first of this month
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.260]   and it'd be easy to catch up on the audio.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.740]   Well, speaking of stories worth telling,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.740]   you have got to hear the story
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.100]   of how Martin Luther shaped the publishing industry
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.740]   as we know it.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.100]   It is one of the key factors behind the Reformation

[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.940]   in a rare 35-minute conversation here
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   with a Reformation historian.
