[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Well, on Friday we looked at the return of Christ.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.920]   It has not happened yet.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.200]   It's yet to come in the future.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.440]   So when?
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.760]   Today we talk about timing.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.960]   Namely, we're going to look at one of the clear pieces of evidence that Christ's return
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.440]   is drawing near.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.000]   Here's the question from a listener to the podcast named Alex.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.400]   I have a question about what Jesus said in Matthew 24, 12, where he said of the end times
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.280]   that lawlessness will be increased and that the love of many will grow cold.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.600]   What does Jesus mean when he says love will grow cold?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240]   Where will this be evidenced?
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.440]   What is cold love?
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440]   And how can we prevent this in our own lives?"
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.240]   Yes, that last question is the nub of the matter, isn't it?
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.800]   So let's set the stage from Matthew 24, where the quote comes from in verse 12.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.640]   Jesus had just looked at the temple in Jerusalem and said, "Truly I say to you, there will
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.680]   not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.760]   And then the disciples asked him, "Well, tell us, when will these things be?
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.680]   And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:34.680]   Now that phrase, "end of the age," refers to the phase of history that we are in, ending
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.080]   with the coming of Christ in judgment, separating the sheep and the goats, raising the dead.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.840]   We know that because of the way the phrase is used in Matthew 13, 39, and 43, where Jesus
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.880]   interprets the parable of the weeds like this, "The harvest is the end of the age, and the
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.920]   reapers are angels.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.880]   Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.960]   age.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.000]   The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.680]   of sin and all lawbreakers and throw them into the fiery furnace.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.320]   In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, and then the righteous will shine
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.960]   like the sun in the kingdom of their Father."
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.040]   So the disciples had heard Jesus talk about this.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.880]   They had heard this description of the end of the age, and they were asking about the
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.400]   end of this period of history marked by that amazing final judgment.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   They didn't know how that related to the destruction of the temple, where all the stones would
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.440]   be thrown down.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.560]   They were asking about both Jesus' answers by describing the kinds of things that will
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.040]   mark this age leading up to the "end of this age."
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.600]   For example, verse 5, "Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ.'
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.760]   They will lead many astray, and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.240]   See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet."
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.400]   So he says, "The end is not yet."
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.080]   He has the end in view, but he warns them that there's going to be some time lapse
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   here.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.120]   It's not the very end yet.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.480]   The end is not yet.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.320]   These things will be happening on the way to the end.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.280]   This will be your experience leading up to the end.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   Then he adds, "All these are but the beginning of the birth pangs," to make clear that there
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.200]   is some time lapse before the end.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.180]   This is the beginning of the birth pangs.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.320]   They will last for some time, unspecified, and then there will be the end of the birth
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.840]   pangs as the new order is brought to birth.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.680]   He goes on in verse 10, "And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.120]   one another, and many false prophets will arise and lead many astray."
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:29.000]   Here's the verse, "Because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's Alex's question.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   What does that mean?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.600]   How can we avoid that?
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.120]   "But the one who endures to the end will be saved, and this gospel of the kingdom will
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.760]   be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   end will come."
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.240]   Now, four observations.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:58.760]   Number one, cold love is the opposite of the warmth of familial affection.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.960]   For example, Genesis 43, 30, when Joseph was about to reveal his identity to his brothers,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.400]   it says, "Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm," warm, not cold, warm, "for
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.960]   his brother, and he sought a place to weep."
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.600]   Same thing in Hosea 11, 8, God says to Israel, "How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.360]   My heart recoils within me.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.520]   My compassion grows warm and tender."
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:39.240]   So cold love is the shell of love that has lost its inner familial warmth.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:47.720]   Number two, the effect of this coldness is that brother betrays brother.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:57.200]   Verse 10, "Then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another."
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:05.360]   That hate is the final outcome of hypocritical love, just the shell of love where the warmth
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.120]   has gone out and ice has come in, and the upshot is no longer just hypocritical love,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.160]   but rather hate that betrays brother to brother.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.280]   Number three, third observation, Jesus says that the reason for this upsurge of cold,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:33.960]   hypocritical love that eventually betrays a brother is owing to the increase of lawlessness.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.320]   Verse 12, "Because lawlessness is increased, the love of many will grow cold."
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.280]   That's worth thinking about, because you might want to turn it around, right?
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.360]   Because love grew cold, there's a lot of lawlessness.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:57.920]   The root of this growing coldness of love in the church toward each other is a deep
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.080]   hostility to authority.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.360]   That's my interpretation of lawlessness, a deep hostility to authority, especially God's
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.560]   authority.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.480]   That's what lawlessness is at root.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   I will not submit to law from outside my sovereign self.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.280]   I'm not going to yield to authority anymore.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:31.320]   Now, to use the language of Paul, the church becomes infected with the mind of the flesh
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.000]   rather than the mind of the Spirit.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:44.840]   Romans 8, 7, "The mind of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law."
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.120]   That's lawlessness.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   Indeed, it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:08:01.600]   So the upsurge of lawlessness is the upsurge of self, the mind of the flesh, over God,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.320]   the insubordinate, "I will not submit," stiff-necked self.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.640]   And Paul speaks directly to this lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2 in relation to the second
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   coming.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.480]   He says, "A great apostasy must come before the end, and the man of lawlessness," make
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.920]   that connection between Matthew 24 and 2 Thessalonians 2, "the man of lawlessness is revealed for
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.840]   the mystery of lawlessness."
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.760]   Same word, "is already at work.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.080]   Only he who now restrains it will do so until he's out of the way, and then the lawless
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:46.720]   one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.280]   bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming."
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:58.680]   So just when anti-authoritarian lawlessness inside and outside the church seems to be
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:06.760]   reaching its fevered peak in history, Jesus will step forward and return on the clouds,
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.840]   and there will be a great reversal.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:18.880]   Finally, a fourth observation to Alex's question about how we can prevent coldness
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.000]   of love from taking over our own hearts.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.660]   This cold love, Jesus says, comes from the increase of lawlessness.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:35.440]   We must fight upstream, so to speak, from the river of love.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.480]   Get up there to the springs.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.880]   We must fight against arrogance and pride and self-sufficiency that is against the spirit
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.000]   of lawlessness in our hearts.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.040]   This is, I will not submit.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.280]   I don't like people telling me what to do, least of all an omnipotent God.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.660]   Lawlessness means we want to be our own law.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.400]   We don't want anybody, especially an infallible, omnipotent God, telling us what to do.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.000]   We want to create our own meaning, create our own identity, create our own rules.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.280]   And when this happens, we have cut ourselves off from Christ and from the Holy Spirit,
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   and therefore from love.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:28.680]   Let me end with the way Hebrews 10.24 exhorts us in view of the second coming like this.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:36.760]   Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.960]   meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.760]   as you see the day drawing near.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.680]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Alex, for today's question.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.400]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   all at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.320]   Well in the ninth chapter of the Gospel of John, we find a remarkable story of a man
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:13.160]   born blind, made to see by the miraculous healing power of Christ.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.560]   It was the kind of miracle, like so many of them, that could not be kept a secret.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.160]   Word spread far and wide of what Jesus had done to this young man.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.760]   And John 9 is a key chapter in understanding the work of God in physical disability, key
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   there.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.060]   But it's also a key chapter for us in understanding how we as Christians, changed by the grace
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:40.240]   of God, can testify of Christ before the world's most powerful and educated people.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.320]   Pastor John explains how and why when we return on Wednesday.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.920]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
