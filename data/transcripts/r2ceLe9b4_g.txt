[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   All right, what do we got here?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Do a couple more questions.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Always check out our time.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Let's do a couple more questions here.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   This one comes from Maria.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Maria says, "My goal is to read more.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I replace checking my phone with reading books.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   However, with more technical books, it's hard to jump in and out.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So I find I struggle to make progress.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   If I only have five to ten minutes, such as waiting in a line,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   it takes some time to remember where I left off conceptually
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and I have to re-read a couple paragraphs before I know
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   what specific point is discussed.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   And by the time I have caught up, I need to put the book down."
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Well, Maria, I like that you are using a higher quality cognitive alternative
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   to just looking at your phone when you're bored in line.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Reading is a great option.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   The solution to your particular issue with this strategy
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   is don't read highly technical books in this context.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Different activities are better suited for different situations.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   So if you're reading in line, novels, as well as episodic
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   or biographical nonfiction, this is really good for jumping in and out.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I usually have some sort of biographical or episodic nonfiction
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I'm listening to on Audible, so I can turn that on when,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   "Oh, I need to go, whatever, put my laundry in,"
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   one of these quick five to ten minute things.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I mean, I find business biographies, for example,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   where it's the story of whatever,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   "Universal's Rise" or the CBS's "Moment of Success"
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   during the early 2000s, those are really well suited to jumping in and out
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   because when I say episodic, I mean they're talking about this show,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   they're talking about this thing that happened,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   they're talking about that thing that happened.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's sort of individual stories, you can come in and out,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   you don't have to keep up with highly technical things.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Novels can be the same way.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Jump back in into the action, it's interesting until you jump back out.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   If you're reading in line, you might also consider
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   our good friends over at Mouse Books.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   This is a product that I like quite a bit.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I've known Brian and Dave in particular for a long time now.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Mouse Books produce these pocket-sized, condensed,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   or abridged versions of famous books or short stories.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   They look like a Field Notes notebook,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   if that's useful.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I think they might use the same printer who does the Field Notes notebooks.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So anyways, it's a little bit smaller than a standard smartphone.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The idea is you can have that in your pocket wherever you have your phone.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So in any instance, when you would pull out your phone,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   you pull out a Mouse Book instead.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So I think that's a cool way to have some more erudite exposure
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to the world of literature and philosophy while you're waiting in line.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Anyways, good for you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And the reason why I don't want you to look at your phone in that situation
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   is not that it's just by default bad.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It's not the phone that is bad.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It is these attention economy companies that dwell on your phone
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and can play your brainstem like a harpsichord.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   The TikToks of the world, the Instagrams of the world,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   the Twitters of the world.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That just gets its hooks into your brain.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   That's what I want you to get away from being the default.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So if you're taking out your phone to work on a wordle,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I don't think that's so bad.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But if you're slack jaw, the drool coming down the side
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   as you're on TikTok videos, not good for you.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.680]   (upbeat music)
