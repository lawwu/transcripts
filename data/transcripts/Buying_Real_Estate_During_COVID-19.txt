[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.400]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.040]   And in this episode, I want to talk about buying real estate
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.320]   in this COVID-19 global pandemic era.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560]   Real estate is my favorite asset class
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.960]   to build wealth because it's simple to understand.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.280]   It's a tangible asset.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.440]   And it provides income.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   Unlike stocks, the value of real estate
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.800]   doesn't just go poof overnight.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.680]   Just think about it.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.560]   When the stock market was declining by 10% a day,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.120]   and when the S&P 500 was down about 32% at one point,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.360]   did the value of real estate drop by 10% a day and 32%?
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.960]   Were you seeing sales down 32% the very next week, or that day,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.280]   or the next month?
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.200]   No.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.720]   Instead, what you've seen is that real estate
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.200]   has held its value during the pandemic so far.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.400]   And some places actually ticked up in value
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.600]   because money rushed out of stocks and into real estate.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.800]   So in this episode, I think it's very important
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.960]   to highlight the opportunity that real estate
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.440]   investors have right now.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.880]   I don't think that opportunity is going to last very long,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.520]   maybe one month or two months.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.600]   Your mission, if you choose to accept,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.320]   is to find that real estate seller who
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.880]   is the equivalent of the stock seller
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.360]   when the Dow was below 19,000 and when the S&P 500 was
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880]   below 2,300.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.920]   Now, it's going to be a little bit hard to find
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.320]   because inventory is down.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   And when a lot of people talk about, OK, well,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.760]   real estate is the next shoe to drop
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.600]   because look what happened in 2008 and 2009
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.400]   when the stock market fell 55%, but real estate prices also
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.320]   fell 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.040]   It's a different situation here, folks.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.920]   Back then in 2008, 2009, we had over leverage
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.760]   in the financial industry.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   We had over leverage in the housing market.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.360]   People were buying homes with 0% down,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   and people were just borrowing as much as they could
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.560]   because banks were lending as much as they could.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   It was a crap show back then, and it took a long time
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.200]   to unwind that leverage.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.840]   When people go bankrupt, it takes seven years to recover.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.960]   But they do recover.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.160]   Here in this example, everything is self-imposed,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.360]   this lockdown to fight the virus.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.440]   And so as you are seeing in the news
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.880]   and you are listening from the governors and the mayors
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.000]   around the countries, these lockdowns
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.440]   will be ending partially in May and hopefully continuously
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.240]   in June, July, and beyond.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.880]   The Redfin CEO did say recently that demand
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.400]   is down about 20% in terms of traffic to the Redfin website.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.880]   And I like Redfin a lot because I
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.520]   think their algorithm is the best for valuing property
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.880]   and finding properties.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   Well, despite demand being down 20%,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.600]   the listings, the inventory on its platform,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   is down about 60%.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.560]   And this is nationwide.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.520]   So demand is down 20%, but listings or inventory
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.080]   is down 60%.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.200]   Therefore, one can conclude that pricing is going to stay steady,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.760]   if not actually tick up.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.160]   You can see from one of my recent posts
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.920]   with highlighted examples of real estate outperformance
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.200]   in San Francisco and in Honolulu.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.240]   And they just keep on coming, folks.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   So for those of us who are trying
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.480]   to be opportunistic in building wealth and buying real estate
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.400]   during this pandemic, it's going to be
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.640]   tough to find the panic sellers.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.680]   But they are out there because we did see the stock market
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.000]   collapse by 32%.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.120]   And we did see many, many people and institutions
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.040]   sell at those levels.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.760]   So based on the law of large numbers,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.800]   even if just 5% of the people are still freaked out
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.360]   and think that we're going to retest the lows, which we very
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.720]   well may, or go much lower, which we very well may,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.680]   5% out of, let's say, a million folks--
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.600]   that's a lot of folks.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.280]   That's 50,000 people.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.400]   Those people are out there, and they are listing their homes.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.440]   And they are listing their homes rationally
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.760]   based on what they think.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   They're listing it now, during lockdowns,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.680]   during the pandemic, because they believe
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.160]   prices will head lower.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.320]   And it's up to you to find these people
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.240]   and offer them lower prices, because you believe things
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   aren't as bad as they seem.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.480]   As you've listened in previous podcast episodes,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   I'm taking a more optimistic approach.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.600]   And just to be forewarned, I'm generally an optimistic person.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.680]   And I try to look at the positives in everything.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.720]   For example, when I sprained my ankle,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.800]   I immediately think to myself, oh, thank god
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.760]   I didn't break my ankle.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.320]   So my attitude is very positive.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.760]   And if you had bought the S&P 500 below 2,400,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.560]   as I discussed in the Stock Market Bottom Analysis post
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.840]   and podcast, you would be up 15% to 30% plus right now,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.240]   depending on what you bought.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   I mean, if you just look at the NASDAQ right now
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.760]   as of early May, we're only down about 1.5%
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.560]   from its all-time high.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.720]   So the NASDAQ tech stocks have tremendously outperformed.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.000]   And it's back to bull markets.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.840]   And technically, we are back to bull markets
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.920]   in the S&P 500 and the Dow, because we rebounded way
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   more than 20% from the bottom.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.080]   We're up 30-plus percent from the bottom now.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.560]   And so what you need to think about
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.240]   is what is going on between the stock market, the economy,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.600]   and the real estate market.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.800]   So obviously, there's a disconnect between the stock
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.120]   market rebound and what the economy is doing,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.720]   because the economy--
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.760]   the ISM manufacturing numbers plummeted.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.840]   Unemployment is at all-time highs.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.560]   We're probably going to be at 40 million by the end of May.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.800]   It's ugly out there in the economy, in the real world.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   But the stock market, not so ugly,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.560]   because the rebound, because it's discounting 3, 6, 9,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   12 months into the future.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.640]   And the future is saying lockdowns are going to end.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.520]   There's probably going to be a second wave.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.440]   Hopefully, there's going to be a vaccine.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.000]   And things are going to get better.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.960]   It's all incremental.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.240]   But the real estate market is very interesting,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.960]   because it lags the stock market.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.120]   It does not transact as efficiently.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.200]   So what we're trying to do is capture that timing mismatch,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.360]   where we find the seller who still thinks we're at the S&P
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.240]   500, down 32%, and who still thinks
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.600]   we're going to head lower.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.280]   Those sellers are out there.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.360]   Those sellers believe the worst has
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.700]   yet to come, because the Federal Reserve and the federal
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.400]   government are ineffective.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.100]   They believe the stimulus checks,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.440]   the enhanced unemployment benefits, and the PPB loans
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.800]   won't get paid and forgiven.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.520]   They believe the coronavirus numbers
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.480]   will be equal to or greater than all the government model
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.000]   predictions.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.840]   They believe there won't be any efficiency or productivity
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.320]   gains after going through months of working from home.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.440]   They also confuse a slowdown in the real estate brokerage
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   business with real estate prices.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   You see a lot of headlines out there that say,
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.360]   real estate is getting crushed.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.700]   But what's really getting crushed
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.900]   is the brokerage business, because the volume is down 60%.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.580]   But pricing of property is something completely different.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.740]   But when you and I read these headlines,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.980]   the automatic assumption is that pricing is collapsing.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.220]   But no, the journalists are talking about the real estate
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.060]   business.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.140]   So please be aware.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.980]   The other thing is there's fear that lockdowns
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.660]   will last well beyond the third quarter of 2020.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.240]   Next, what do they believe?
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.480]   People are going to actually start saving aggressively
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.420]   post-lockdown or post-pandemic instead
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.980]   of reverting back to their old ways of spending
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.260]   more than they can make?
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.420]   You can never, ever, ever count out the US consumer
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.100]   to take on debt, to max out their credit card,
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.340]   and to live well beyond their means.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.220]   We are a proud nation full of independent people
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.620]   who, doesn't matter how little we work at something
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.300]   or how little risk we take, we always
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.660]   believe we deserve better.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.140]   So how do we find these sellers?
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.340]   Well, the easiest way to find these sellers--
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.660]   and frankly, the only way if you're locked down--
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.580]   is to search for them online.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.300]   Be vigilant in looking at areas that you
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.380]   want to buy on the real estate platforms out there.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.700]   Redfin and Zillow are the two most common ones.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.300]   And if you find something that is either mispriced
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.060]   or is just an interesting opportunity,
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.920]   go ahead and reach out to the selling agent.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.620]   I did so the other week.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.860]   And I was able to get in there and have private showings.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.460]   And when you do a private showing,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.980]   that is when you can talk to the agent
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.860]   and feel him or her out about what's
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.700]   going on in the seller's point of view, what's going on
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.740]   regarding demand and so forth.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.060]   Nothing good comes easy, folks.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.660]   So go online.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.320]   Take a look at what's out there.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.500]   Make the effort to contact the agent.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.660]   Do a private showing.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.820]   And talk and ask and question what is going on.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.760]   Because again, any seller listing
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   during a lockdown period and a pandemic
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.280]   has to be a motivated seller.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.360]   Otherwise, you would just wait one or two months
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.760]   once the lockdown ends to sell your property.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.440]   It's just irrational to think you're
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.240]   going to get a higher price or your asking price
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.800]   when you're listing during a lockdown.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.720]   We can just wait.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.760]   So it's up to you to take advantage.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.000]   And to take advantage, you have to do several things.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.160]   One, you've got to focus on making a connection
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.460]   with the seller.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.220]   Making a connection with anybody is the key
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.780]   to a better relationship.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.080]   It's the key to getting a better price.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.140]   Because the seller wants to feel comfortable,
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.760]   feel good about selling to someone.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.060]   The selling process is very nerve wracking.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.020]   It is way more stressful to be a seller than a buyer.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.060]   Because so many things can fall through
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.740]   during the selling process.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.400]   So one, you make a connection.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.640]   Either you write a real estate love letter
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.180]   and you tell the listing agent how much you love the property
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.580]   and how focused and interested you are.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.660]   Two, let's be frank here.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.580]   You should become the doomer bear
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.540]   that they are right now for listing their property.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.100]   The seller is nervous.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.300]   Otherwise, he or she wouldn't list right now.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.780]   The seller knows that if they don't
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.220]   sell within a certain period of time,
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.420]   the property goes, quote, "stale fish."
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.500]   And when properties go stale fish,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.060]   price cuts are an inevitability.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.220]   It's also embarrassing when you put yourself out there
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.400]   and get rejected or get no offers.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.000]   As a result of so much worry and stress,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.040]   using the end of the world strategy
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.120]   can motivate your seller to sell.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.860]   And luckily for you, it's currently much easier
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.460]   to imagine the end of the world, given the 24/7 news cycle is
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.520]   all about the coronavirus deaths and economic destruction.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.760]   The news knows that negativity sells.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   That's why they continuously pump out
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.800]   negative content out there to fear people
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.440]   into reading their stuff.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.980]   I take the different angle, but if I was strategically smart,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.000]   I would also pump out lots of negative stuff.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.880]   But it's just not me.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.120]   It's just not my personality.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.000]   I want to look through the noise and try to get things better
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.560]   for the rest of us.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.040]   So look, the second strategy is really
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.220]   to become the doomer bear that the seller is right now.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.980]   Otherwise, they wouldn't list it.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.960]   You could talk about the big picture scenario,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.900]   such as discussing 40 million people unemployed
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.480]   and what's going to happen to the real estate market
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.400]   if this continues.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   You can talk about how the stock market corrected by 50%
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.160]   in 2008 and 2009, and the real estate market followed suit.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.680]   You can talk about COVID-19 mutating and thereby
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.400]   risking maybe billions of more people.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.080]   It just never ends how much negativity
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.880]   you can talk about if you choose to be negative.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.480]   And the interesting thing is it's really not too much
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.280]   hyperbole to talk about all these negative things,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.400]   because if you look at the government models,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.440]   they are so bearish.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.840]   They are so doomsday scenario.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.760]   But thankfully, we know that these models
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.560]   haven't come close to being true.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.120]   So in case you feel that you're talking nonsense
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.400]   or the seller thinks you're talking nonsense,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.000]   all you've got to do is show the government models
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.720]   at various stages without showing
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.200]   the reality of what happened.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.120]   Because hey, you've got to believe the government, right?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.560]   They've got the smartest people, supposedly,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.320]   and the smartest scientists on the job.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.120]   So if you can't believe the government,
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.840]   are you going to believe a buyer who's
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   trying to get a better deal?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.160]   Well, it's tough to say.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.440]   Your goal is really to paint a picture of the house
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.600]   being a tremendous burden and you
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.840]   being the savior of that burden.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.640]   Obviously, you don't want to come across
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.440]   as crazy or just unrealistic.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.240]   Instead, you want to come across as financially stable.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.880]   You want to be a realist.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   Because after all, any one of these things about doom
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.320]   and all that could happen.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.920]   Nobody has a crystal ball.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.800]   Nobody knows anything for certain.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.680]   It's about thinking in bets and percentages.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.480]   Like Inception, that movie, one of my favorite movies,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.800]   if you could implant just one of these doomsday items
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.840]   into their minds as they are mulling over your offer,
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.740]   there's a better chance you could turn them
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:11.160]   into the panic stock seller when the Dow was at 18,500
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.520]   or when the S&P 500 was at 2,250.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   For the moment, buying at those levels
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.480]   was a great idea for stock investors.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.560]   You just want to rewind time and be that real estate
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.320]   buyer at those levels as well.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.280]   A couple more strategies you should think about
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.720]   as a buyer of real estate.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.560]   You should focus on the benefits of a simpler life.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.600]   A large reason why many real estate sellers want to sell
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.680]   is because real estate requires maintenance.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   And if you're a landlord, well, it
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.720]   requires a lot of people interaction,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.280]   which is not something we want really right now.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.040]   So your goal is to allow the seller to think,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.560]   oh, if they could just have a simpler life and sell to you,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.080]   everything will be OK.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   I sold one of my main rental properties in 2017
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.080]   because I just couldn't take dealing with the tenants
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.920]   anymore and the maintenance issues.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.300]   The property wasn't that far away,
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.640]   but it was still a 25-minute drive away.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.840]   And it just wasn't my time.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.960]   And everybody has a different time
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.120]   or is at a different stage in their lives
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.800]   where they have different priorities.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.200]   So focus on the benefits of a simpler life for the seller.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.280]   And then finally, you want the seller
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.840]   to make them fear losing you.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.960]   After investing so much in getting to know you,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.000]   writing the love letter, telling the agent what
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.240]   you plan to do with the property, and so forth,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   you have to make him or her fear losing you.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.880]   That is human nature as well.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.680]   You don't really fully appreciate something
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.840]   until they're gone.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.520]   So I make sellers fear losing me by writing a real estate
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.280]   breakup letter.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.720]   And you can learn how to write one.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.560]   And you can see an example in one of my posts
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.680]   if you Google real estate breakup letter,
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.160]   Financial Samurai.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.720]   Also, I discuss about the rise in inventory.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   Inventory is ticking up right now in May.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.600]   And I think it's going to continue to tick up.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.200]   Basically, what we're seeing is a shift from spring inventory.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.000]   It's going to go into summer and so forth.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.400]   It's kind of like, well, if we've
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.680]   been locked down for two months in March and April,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.240]   maybe May as well, right?
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.600]   Let's just shift the summer vacation up.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.840]   And then we start school in the summer and so forth.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.760]   That's an obviously easy solution.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   And we are seeing inventory tick up a little bit.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.600]   And so from the seller's point of view,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.400]   the more inventory that is out there, the more competition
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.600]   he or she has.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.880]   So that is something to be aware of as well.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.840]   So let's move on to what is the right offer
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.800]   price during a pandemic.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.040]   Given the S&P 500 corrected by 32% from its high,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.920]   you could offer 32% below comparable sales prices
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.040]   right before the coronavirus hits.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.160]   So that's February 2020.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.680]   Your real estate agent can easily
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.600]   pull up all the most recent coms.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.160]   And so can you.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.680]   Unfortunately, I think offering 32% lower than the most recent
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.720]   coms will likely get you shut out.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.800]   And it will likely seriously offend the seller.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.520]   So I don't think that's the right strategy.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.680]   I think a better offer starting price
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.920]   is somewhere around 10% to 20% below recent coms.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.720]   Probably 20%.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.520]   I think you're still going to get shut out.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.600]   And you're still going to offend a lot of sellers.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.720]   But 20% is where you can start.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.080]   And hopefully, you can get a price between 10% to 20%
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.240]   below February 2020 levels.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.160]   It's going to be very hard because inventory is down again.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.640]   And sellers aren't stupid.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.840]   And the real estate agent isn't stupid.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.760]   But there are obviously real estate agents
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.360]   out there who are hungry for a transaction
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.840]   because their business is on volume.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.800]   It's not on whether the seller gets the highest price
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.640]   or whether the buyer gets the lowest price.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.240]   It's on transaction volume.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.280]   That's how they're going to get their commissions.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.960]   And volume has been way down for the past two months.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.040]   And a little bit more thoughts on your offer.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.080]   The best type of offer is an all cash offer.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.280]   Now, if you don't have all cash, you
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.960]   need to get pre-approved for a mortgage
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.000]   so you can offer a no financing contingency
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.640]   offer, which is basically like all cash,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.040]   but it's from the bank.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.120]   It's not as good.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's not as good because there's a second party involved
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.200]   that the seller has to worry about not going through,
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.520]   even though the bank has already said and committed
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.600]   to offering you x amount of mortgage
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.120]   because they've already underwritten
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.400]   all your information.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.840]   And they've already decided, based
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.680]   on the data you've provided, that you're good to go.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.840]   Getting pre-approved is not as good as an all cash offer,
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.440]   but it's better than getting pre-qualified, which really
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.520]   doesn't count, folks.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.880]   It's just figuring out-- pre-qualified is just
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.640]   figuring out how much you can potentially borrow.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.400]   And there's no commitment from the bank.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.120]   So just be aware of that.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.920]   In conclusion, again, I think there's only a one to two month
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.320]   window where you can find these sellers out there who
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.640]   don't realize that things have improved in the economy
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.680]   and in the stock market.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.080]   And let's say we do retest the lows and go lower.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.200]   Well, that is certainly a possibility.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:20.120]   I think retesting the lows is probably a 25% to 30%
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.000]   maybe probability.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.400]   And going lower, well, much lower than the lows
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.080]   is probably a 10% probability at this point.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.360]   So if you did end up buying real estate at 10% to 20%
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.680]   below, let's say, the February 2020 levels, well,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   at least you are buying at a more appropriate level
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.520]   if we do head lower or go lower in the stock market
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.160]   and the economy and so forth.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.240]   I really wish everyone good luck out there.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.560]   There's no certainty out there.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.400]   There's no certainty from me or from the sellers
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.600]   or from the buyers.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.320]   We just have to do the best we can
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.960]   with the information we have available at the time.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.800]   I've moved on from the stock market.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.720]   I've sold 100% of what I bought in March at the end of April
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.600]   and into early May when the S&P 500 rebounded to 28.50
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.120]   and higher.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   It got up to, what, 29.50.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   And it's just amazing how much we've come,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.840]   how far we've come.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.520]   And I decided to de-risk again.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.400]   De-risk, de-risk, de-risk is my mantra for the summer.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.600]   And I'm back down to my 20% of net worth in equities
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.640]   allocation from 25%.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.680]   But I'm not done.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.440]   I'm not done because I believe there's
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.320]   opportunity in real estate.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.920]   And so if you are a savvy real estate and stock market
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.440]   investor, you can use the information
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.960]   to play off each other.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   Because again, real estate is a laggard to the stock market.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.920]   And we know this from previous cycles.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.920]   And I know this from my history investing
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   in the stock market and the real estate market
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.320]   during the previous financial crisis and the one before that.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.560]   So if you missed out on buying stocks
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.920]   when everything was falling apart in March,
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.720]   I think you have an opportunity to buy real estate
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.120]   at depressed levels from highly motivated sellers.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.800]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.480]   The game is never over.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.020]   So keep playing, keep understanding, keep listening,
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.280]   keep reading.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.840]   The opportunities are out there if you pay attention
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.520]   and you take action.

[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.440]   Take care, everyone.
