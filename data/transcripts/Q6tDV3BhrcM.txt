[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   You have to have the free markets
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   in order to build prosperity.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.360]   And prosperity means economic power.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.000]   If you have economic power, no one messes with you.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.920]   Or if they're gonna do it,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.840]   they're gonna have to think twice.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.560]   - The following is a conversation with Magat Wade,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   an entrepreneur who's passionate
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.120]   about creating positive change in Africa
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.000]   through economic empowerment.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   This is the Alex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.120]   in the description.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660]   And now, dear friends, here's Magat Wade.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.940]   You were born in Senegal.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.480]   You have lived and traveled across the world.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.360]   So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal?
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.280]   Like its people, its culture, its history.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.880]   Can you try to sneak up on telling us
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.160]   what is the spirit of its people?
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.720]   - Taranga, Taranga.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.840]   Taranga, it's a Wolof word.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.680]   Wolof is a main indigenous language of Senegal.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.840]   And it means hospitality.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.560]   That is what us, the people of Senegal, are known for.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.160]   And it transpires in everything that we do,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.960]   everything that we say.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.880]   It's a place where, I guess with hospitality
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.700]   goes this concept of warmth.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.320]   So we are a very warm people.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.480]   So in a nutshell, that's us.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   That's us, the place where you come.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.440]   And everybody will just embrace you,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.920]   make you feel very comfortable,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.320]   make you feel like you're the only person in the world
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.720]   and that we've been waiting for you our whole life.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360]   So that's my country.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160]   - So that's for people in Senegal, people in Africa,
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.720]   or also people across the world,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   weird strangers from all walks of life.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.360]   So hospitality towards everyone.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.320]   - For everyone, for everyone,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.280]   especially towards the foreigner.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.920]   Because it's very ingrained in us,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.880]   this understanding that especially the foreigner,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.960]   the foreigner is called foreigner
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.760]   because the foreigner is coming from somewhere else.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.040]   So if someone has taken the time and the energy,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.160]   whether in a forced manner or because it's a choice
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.840]   to travel so far to come to a place that's not theirs
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.560]   to start with, that's probably foreigners again,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.600]   then it is your duty to welcome them,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.040]   to be uber welcoming to them.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.960]   - So there's not a fear of the foreigner,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.640]   there's not a suspicion of the foreigner.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.360]   - No, no, no.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.280]   And I think this goes with the other way around.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.680]   Maybe it has to do with just,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.040]   when you feel good about yourself,
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.720]   when you're very grounded yourself,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.840]   it's very easy to open yourself to others.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.880]   And I'm wondering if that's not
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.560]   the other side of the equation in a way.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   So no, we don't have a fear towards a foreigner.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.400]   That's just not.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.840]   - When you have a pride of your culture,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.360]   a pride of your own people,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.840]   it's easier to sort of embrace.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.120]   I mean, it's interesting how these kind of cultures emerge
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   'cause the Slavic countries are sometimes colder.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.880]   They're slower to trust others.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.360]   We're now here in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.160]   One of the reasons I fell in love with this place
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.880]   when I showed up is there's that same hospitality
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.240]   as compared to other cities I've lived in.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.040]   Sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.560]   There's a hesitation to open up, to be fragile,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.320]   to be caring before understanding
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.920]   what I can gain from you kind of calculation.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.760]   It's really interesting.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.200]   And I wonder how those kinds of dynamics emerge
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.840]   'cause there's certainly parts of the world,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.280]   like Austin is one of them,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.040]   where you just feel the kindness,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.280]   just radiate without knowing kindness from strangers.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.720]   - You know, if I were to advance one thing,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.920]   and I had the same experience
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.520]   after having lived in San Francisco first,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.600]   then we went to New York, then we came to Austin.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.320]   And when we came to Austin, I felt,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.360]   it took me a while to put my finger on it,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.480]   but what I found in Austin, people just hang.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.920]   People, right?
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.000]   They're real.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.840]   They're real.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   Unlike what you were saying,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.680]   I feel like in these other places,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.320]   it's a destination for people who want to come and perform.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   I think maybe the early San Francisco people,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.720]   it was different for them.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.520]   But later, as prosperity starts to come in
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.040]   and success comes in, then you attract a different breed.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160]   At first, we're the people who made it,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.920]   who made this place be what it is.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.960]   And then it attracts all the bling followers
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.800]   and the bling-attracted people.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.120]   And when those people show up,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.240]   it's time for all of us to get out.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.200]   And that's one of my worries about Austin too.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.400]   And I guess I count myself in it,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.840]   but because we're also new arrivees.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.200]   Always been furious now.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.960]   But how are we gonna protect this place?
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.200]   - Yeah.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.840]   Yeah, these are the best possible version
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.320]   of the Austin history.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.120]   This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.600]   And so you get a chance to build on top of this culture
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.040]   that's already been here, of the weirdos, the artists,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.760]   the sort of the characters,
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.880]   but also the general kindness and love
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.080]   that just permeates the whole place.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.480]   Build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.600]   So like tech companies, new startups,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.440]   And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.160]   totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.320]   and dream big and build it here.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.400]   I think Elon represents that with all the people
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.480]   they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.600]   But there's a bunch of other companies
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.960]   that are just like coming up.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.480]   I get to talk to a bunch of tech people
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.120]   and they're just incredible.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.120]   Versus San Francisco, there's a cynicism a bit.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.440]   And also some of the interaction with strangers,
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.200]   there's always a bit of a calculation.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Like how good is this going to be for my career?
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.080]   - Or how can, yeah.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.560]   How can hanging out with this person can advance me?
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.320]   You go to a party, you're seizing, they're seizing up.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.600]   It's like, I'm not gonna talk to someone
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.200]   so because that's not gonna advance me.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.520]   Who's gonna advance me next?
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.200]   And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.120]   And I think maybe there's one way to try to,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.640]   I really would like to see Austin not go the way
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.680]   San Francisco did and other towns before.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.040]   - I like how you pronounce San Francisco
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   with a French accent.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   - San Francisco?
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.880]   (laughing)
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.720]   - That's great.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.160]   That's the one word you go with a French accent.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.440]   - You have to. - Sounds beautiful.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.280]   San Francisco.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.800]   - San Francisco.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.360]   But you know, so now that you find that cute,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.160]   you're gonna have to forgive me when I mess up my English
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.240]   because English is not my first language.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.200]   So I always try to make sure people know that.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.040]   But you know, Lex, this is why I am very interested
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.800]   in what some folks here are working on.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.480]   And I'm just gonna be very selfish here
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.960]   because I wanna help her with what she's doing.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nocek
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   and her project, you know, with the housing project
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.560]   that they have right now,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.800]   making sure that Austin remains a town
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.480]   that's affordable for people of all walks of lives.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.120]   If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of lives,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.320]   doesn't matter how little or big you're making money-wise,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.640]   that you can stay in this town
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.080]   so the diversity at that level can remain,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.040]   then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   how to do things differently.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.680]   And what I love about her initiative
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.880]   is just how they're really trying, you know,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.800]   to again, work on keeping affordability down
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.000]   for most people.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.920]   I think it's important to,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.440]   because it seems like it matters to you,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.920]   I know that it matters to me.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.400]   I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.240]   as San Francisco did.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.640]   And I think the key to that is making sure
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.960]   that true diversity, not like the fluff, fluff, crap
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   diversity we're hearing over there.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.680]   And that's another thing, by the way,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.800]   because San Francisco likes to pride itself in,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.280]   oh, you know, we are so into diversity.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.160]   But I'm like, if diversity for you means gender,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.640]   difference of gender, skin color, you know,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.200]   maybe the different accents we have,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.840]   and you think check, check, check, check, check,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.800]   I'm like, it's not enough.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.240]   Can we also add diversity of thoughts?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.120]   And that's the other problem I have with that place.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.080]   You know, and I know some folks
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.680]   who are scared of saying much around people.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.040]   That's also another thing.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.760]   So not only they're sizing you up,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.800]   but everybody's also, there is this invisible,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.600]   this invisible, how should I say this?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.360]   There's this invisible agreement
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.080]   that they all seem to have to stay on script.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.600]   - Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.720]   a certain kind of script that's very kind of shallow.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.240]   And there is a bit of a categorization going on.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.800]   Which category do you belong to?
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.440]   And let's put this into a simple math equation
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.560]   of what comes out, as opposed to just the free, open
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.960]   embrace of people, the weirdos, the characters,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.360]   the interesting, the full, deep sense of diversity.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.200]   - Exactly.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.120]   - Not just ideas, but backgrounds,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.320]   and rich and poor, like-
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.480]   - Artists, engineers, name it.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.600]   - High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.040]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.600]   That's what makes for a rich society
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.800]   that's gonna get ahead.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.560]   - I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.460]   I know she really is passionate about.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.800]   I don't know how complicated that work is,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.400]   because there's probably a big force
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   trying to increase how much it costs to live in Austin.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.640]   - Yeah.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.240]   - I don't know how you resist that.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.120]   Whenever I go to New York City,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.520]   just the fact that there's a giant park
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.800]   in the middle of it, I wonder,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.320]   how did they pull this off?
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.760]   This is amazing.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.320]   It's like to resist the force of the increasing price
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   of the land, and still to protect this idea
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.160]   of having a park.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.640]   And then in the same way, protecting the ability
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.080]   for people from all walks of life
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.380]   to live in the center of the city,
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.400]   to live around the city, to chase a dream
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.760]   when they don't get any money in their pocket.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.440]   - I don't know how you do that.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.760]   It's partly political, probably,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.400]   regulation, all that kind of stuff.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.080]   But a lot of it has to do with regulations.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.400]   And this is where her and I also very much
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.280]   see eye to eye in terms of the free markets
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.840]   and also prosperity building,
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.040]   because it's always the same problems
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.440]   most of the time, most places.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.320]   Here what you have is some people
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.280]   in the name of, we gotta stand for,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.720]   and I don't like to use this word,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   but maybe you help me find a better one.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.120]   But at least that's a word that people can understand.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.720]   We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.040]   Some people would call them,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.160]   maybe oftentimes use the word, maybe the underdogs,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.600]   whatever it is, I will just say,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.760]   maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right?
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.560]   In the name of standing up for them,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.920]   you're promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.280]   and where they end up being the first ones
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   to suffer from it.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.280]   So let's take this whole housing issue
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   that Nicole and her team are working on.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.880]   We find that oftentimes the cost,
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.240]   at the end of the day, it's the good old supply
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.360]   and demand equation.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.480]   If you're gonna make it so hard
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.440]   that the supply level of housing remains
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.160]   below a certain threshold,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.800]   remains lower than the demand of people who need,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.680]   especially affordable housing, housing altogether,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.840]   what's gonna happen is, scarcity, prices go up,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.600]   and who gets kicked out first?
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   The lesser fortunate among us.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.680]   And so, but I find that oftentimes people
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.600]   in the name of we care, don't engage their mind.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.040]   And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   he said, "Having a heart for the poor, that's easy.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.440]   "Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge."
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.120]   And oftentimes, we all have a heart for the poor,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.400]   but when it comes then to, then what do we do
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.880]   to have a real impact on making sure
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.920]   people get a chance at going up,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.400]   then that's where everything starts falling apart.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.840]   And then you have people who,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.560]   then they start pushing for policies, housing policies,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.840]   making it super hard for you to even renovate
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.800]   or add one more story to your home or anything like that.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.200]   By doing that, you're messing up with the supply,
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   with the supply of housing,
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.080]   and therefore the people who can't afford,
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.200]   people get priced out of a market.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.160]   And so what people like Nicole are doing
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.360]   are going back to where all of this is taking place,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.280]   and they're going back to the regulation side.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.440]   And just like, I'm sure we'll talk about it here,
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.080]   but people wonder today,
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.000]   why is Africa the poorest region in the world?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.040]   We go back to the same culprit, bad laws,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.640]   and tons of senseless regulations.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.000]   If you make it so hard that in Berkeley,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.400]   for someone to build one more story to their home,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.880]   which means maybe one more unit
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.440]   that could be rented out to someone,
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.640]   and if many more people do that,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.600]   and you have a much bigger supply,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.320]   which means the prices will go down,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.200]   which means more people have access,
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.960]   and among them, especially the lesser fortunate among us,
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.560]   then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we?
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.440]   But instead, if you go the other way around,
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.400]   then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of a market.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   Same thing was done with us.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.560]   So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature,
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.120]   you can betcha that regulations and senseless laws
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.560]   are the heart of it, and that's what they're tackling.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.720]   It's not popular, it's not fun,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.360]   and people tend to not even understand
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.520]   where you're coming from,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.560]   but this is a problem we have
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.880]   with people not understanding economic econ 101.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.480]   - Well, so it's the regulation and the laws
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.840]   and the system that props them up
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.920]   and increases the span of those laws,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.240]   and we'll talk about that,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.960]   the fascinating way those kinds of things develop,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.760]   when it works, when it doesn't.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.560]   Let me sort of step back
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.240]   and ask you a question about Africa.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.000]   In the West, in many places in the world,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.680]   Africa is almost talked about like it's one country,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.280]   like it's one place.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.720]   So in what ways is Africa one community,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.120]   and in what ways is it many, many, many communities,
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.680]   just from your perspective, in Senegal and beyond?
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.960]   - Right.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   So at the most basic of what makes us one
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.320]   goes back to even what makes you African.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.960]   You are African, I'm African.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.520]   We're one big family.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.560]   Africa is very much at the end of the day,
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.280]   the foundation and the birth of the human race.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.600]   So from that standpoint, at the most basic level,
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.440]   we're all Africans.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.040]   - Where this whole thing started.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.640]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.160]   Where this whole thing started,
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.240]   and how at some point,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.600]   humanity was hanging by its fingernails.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.880]   Only 2,000 of us were left on this earth,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.200]   and eventually we started, we went for survival,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.280]   and that's how we started to spread around,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.360]   and some going up north, some going this way, that way,
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.680]   and as you're traveling to different places,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.200]   then features start to change,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.600]   to adapt to where you are, right?
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.120]   So hair gets lighter for some people,
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   eyes get different shape for others,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.240]   to adjust to our new natural habitat.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.680]   You know, the genomics program,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.920]   I think at the National Geographic did that so well
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.120]   for people who are interested in going back
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.280]   to that work with Spencer Wells and such.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.000]   But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   that's what unites us all, first of all.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.800]   And then I would say that the continent,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.880]   especially here, I will group it into Black Africa,
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.080]   you know, Black Africa.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.560]   Unfortunately, our common stories, you know,
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.200]   of having gone through this terrible, horrible period
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.560]   of around the same time,
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.440]   the whole continent being enslaved and colonized,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.520]   so that in a way forms,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.120]   not that we were ever the first people
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.280]   or only people ever enslaved in this world.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.920]   As a matter of fact, I mean, the word slaves
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.600]   comes from esclav, slave, slavs, les slavs, right?
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.000]   From the Eastern Bloc.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.120]   So the first slaves were actually people looking more
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.320]   like you than looking like me, right?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.520]   So, but we don't necessarily remember all of that
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.280]   because in our human psyche,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   the closest to us in history of a big mass of people
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.600]   being enslaved is African people.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.720]   We were the last group like that.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.360]   - You know, the pain of World War I
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.000]   and World War II permeates Europe,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.840]   but it certainly does for the former Soviet Union,
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.160]   the countries that made up the former Soviet Union.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.440]   Does in the same way,
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   the pain of slavery
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.200]   and empires using Africa, does that permeate the culture?
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.920]   Is there still echoes of that?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.520]   - In a way, yes.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.400]   Especially the fact that, you know,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.080]   in many different places,
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.360]   whether it's Ghana or my country or Benin,
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.040]   where you have these places
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.840]   that we call the door of no return
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.560]   or the places of no return,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.400]   which this was the last place
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.760]   where the slaves were standing or, you know,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.000]   this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.640]   There is this one door, you're there in the slave house.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.440]   And once they go, they go.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.560]   It's, that's it.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.160]   That's going to be the last time they see back home.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:43.320]   So, you know, those, of course, of course,
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   it creates for a common lived experience,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.640]   which becomes a common lived history.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.760]   And of course, it's going to tie us up.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.080]   - Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.920]   - Yeah.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.560]   - Is there a kind of resentment of the foreigner
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.080]   that there's a rich, vibrant land?
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.480]   There's many resources, there's powerful cultures.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.240]   Are they just going to show up and use us?
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.080]   - Yeah.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.520]   - That's a way to see geopolitics in this modern world.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.720]   - Yeah, this is, okay.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.800]   So where it plays very differently is,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.400]   so if you came to Senegal today,
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.000]   there is not really a problem at that level.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.160]   Where people's resentment start to come from
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.240]   is, of course, when bad behavior shows up,
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.920]   meaning like you have so many white people who can show up
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.400]   and just in their attitude,
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.720]   they have an entitlement attitude, right?
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.320]   And they think that in a way we're all still servants.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.160]   Some people in your face, some people more,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.400]   but that can cause some little resentment.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.240]   But where really the resentment is.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.600]   - And that can, the entitlement can take different forms.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.440]   - Different forms.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.280]   - Like even pity.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.120]   - Yes.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.480]   - Don't even get me going on that one.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.120]   I was trying to be polite today.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.080]   So just don't, Lex, do not.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.440]   Sometimes I tell myself, my God,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.760]   today you're going to be all composed.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.680]   You're going to be, you know, Lex, you're all composed.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.240]   So don't go there and make a fool of yourself.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.280]   Just behave.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.120]   - Yeah, hold it together.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.360]   - But if you get me on some grounds,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.080]   that's when it's all going to go to hell.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.840]   - So yeah, let's move beyond that too.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.960]   So resentment, there's a dance between hospitality
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.800]   and resentment.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.640]   - And resentment.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.200]   So when you come in, you're you, you live your life.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.800]   You're just a normal human being.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.160]   And you treat me decently like you would treat a friend,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.040]   normal people.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.160]   I have no problem with you.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.200]   I'm not going to come back and be like,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.640]   well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.200]   You, you're not going to see that stuff.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.440]   Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like that's,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.480]   you know, it might look like that.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   But we in Africa don't do that.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.560]   Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.160]   You think you're still serving servants around.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.360]   Well, you're going to have a problem.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.040]   Someone like me, I might even grab you
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.720]   by the back of your neck and, you know,
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.000]   take you back to the airport.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.280]   That's when you're lucky.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.920]   - I'll be you very quickly.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.760]   - Exactly.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.960]   But where things come up is,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.720]   especially nowadays with the African youth,
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.520]   when we have to be reminded of a World Bank,
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.320]   when we have to be reminded of even the world,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.640]   places like the World Economic Forum,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   you know, like all of these places that seem to constitute.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.120]   They would, the way they describe them,
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.240]   when I say they, it's primarily my Pan-African friends.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.280]   So here maybe terms are worth describing.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.480]   So the Pan-African movement goes way back when.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.680]   We're talking about, you know, way back when,
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   started in the '30s, going on all the way from there.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.800]   So what you have there is people
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.680]   who have started coming together
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.240]   and dreaming up an emancipated Africa,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.640]   away from the colonies, because at that point,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.440]   there were still colonies, and dreaming up all of that.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.560]   So we're talking about people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.840]   We're talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.920]   talking about Blaise Tieng of Senegal,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.520]   and other people like that, Bandia of Malawi.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.960]   So anyway, so, and the African youth of today,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.840]   we're still hanging on to some of these ideas
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.880]   and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   So when you were talking about what seems to unite you,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.200]   there is that, you know, also,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.960]   meaning like we all feel like we're part of the same family.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.320]   Is it only in our heads?
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.160]   Is it in reality?
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.640]   For many different reasons,
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.400]   there is definitely what we call a Pan-African movement.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.360]   And I very much myself, consider myself one of them.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.280]   I don't agree all the time with where we wanna go
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.320]   and how we wanna go there, but not where we wanna go.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.680]   Where we wanna go is we would love
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.640]   to see a united Africa, for sure.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.400]   But how to get that accomplished,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.480]   that's where oftentimes we have issues.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.480]   So on something like that,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.800]   so this Pan-African, especially the Pan-African youth,
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.880]   but it's beyond the Pan-African youth,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.920]   it's the youth in general in Africa, World Bank, UN,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.200]   all of these organizations that they tend to qualify
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.640]   as imperialist organizations.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.360]   And it's not always a correct way to describe them,
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.440]   but I'm sure you get the sentiment.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.480]   And from that place, there is tons of resentment,
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.720]   because for the longest time, these groups, organizations,
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.200]   and some that preceded them,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.640]   have proceeded to actually decide
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   what even our new frontiers would be.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.680]   You see, when you go to a place like Senegal,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.760]   Mali, all of that, different countries,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.400]   but we were one people, one group, one kingdom.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.240]   And then at some point, they decided,
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   just when you look at Africa,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.040]   have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.440]   You're like, did a robot just draw these?
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.040]   Really? - No fancy robot.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.480]   - No fancy robot, especially this one, it looks so cute.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.640]   But you know what I mean?
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   So they have continued deciding what it would be
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:09.920]   to be us, to live on our land, and how do we even progress?
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.000]   And it just keeps on going.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   They get to decide which type of even economic development
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.520]   path are we gonna choose or not?
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.000]   So from that standpoint, yes, there's a lot of resentment,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.760]   including even from people like me.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.600]   - Yeah, and it's interesting that the invader
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   and the oppressor and the empires
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.320]   have actually created a force for unity.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.000]   I've seen that in Ukraine, in the invasion of Ukraine,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.320]   where it was a pretty divided, not a pretty,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.760]   a very divided country with many factions.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.840]   But the invasion really forced everyone to think
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.800]   about the identity of this nation together.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.240]   Beyond factions, beyond all of that,
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.160]   it allowed it to look at its history and its future.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.560]   They all say that all great nations
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.600]   have had to have a war of independence.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.680]   And this is our war to find our own identity.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.400]   And so in that sense, Africa as one place,
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   as one continent, had to find multiple times its identity
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.240]   through the resistance of the oppressor.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.920]   - Especially sub-Saharan Africa,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.720]   especially sub-Saharan Africa, yes.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.120]   - And there's an interesting aspect to this
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.440]   because the president of Senegal
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.920]   is also the head of the African Union.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.160]   So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.560]   of that whole situation.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.160]   But let me ask in general,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.200]   you talk about this question, this fascinating question,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.440]   what does it take for a country to prosper?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.960]   What does it take for a country to prosper?
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   You see many countries in the world that really struggle
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.480]   and many that flourish.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.880]   And it's not always obvious why,
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.360]   because some have natural resources, some don't.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.960]   Some have wars, some don't.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.480]   And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.160]   So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.200]   Is there commonalities?
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.040]   Is there fundamental ideas
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.800]   that result in a prosperity of a nation?
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.440]   - Today, I can confidently say yes,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.880]   despite all the differences that you talked about.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.320]   And I think then this is where it becomes very important
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   that we are very clear about the question you asked me.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.720]   You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous?
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.240]   So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.960]   because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.080]   sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.920]   you conduct yourself, otherwise, socially speaking.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.680]   So you can be prosperous,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.080]   and still when it comes to your family laws,
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.560]   all the way you approach the other aspects of your life,
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.840]   maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.960]   or you're in a very liberal society.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.560]   So for me, when we talk about prosperity,
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.480]   I just want to make sure that we are clear on that,
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.320]   because some people might be somewhere and be like,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.000]   "Well, because I know what I'm gonna talk to you about next."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And some people are gonna sit there and be like,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.640]   "Well, China is not like that."
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.840]   Or, "Even Dubai is not like that."
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   No, so what I'm talking about is this thing,
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.640]   and that's what I love about this.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.680]   If we just stick to the word prosperity,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.960]   to me, I see prosperity as this.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.480]   It's like, economically speaking,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.080]   what are we gonna be to be a prosperous nation?
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.760]   Meaning we are a middle to high income nation.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.200]   I'm not talking about what are the rights of your women
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.240]   to vote, or can people live like this,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.680]   or I'm not talking about any of that.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.440]   - Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.360]   - Yes, because I think that distinction
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.080]   is very important because over the years,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.280]   I've seen people push back on all types of things,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   and it occurred to me that that's what,
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.800]   the misunderstanding was there.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.200]   So if we're gonna talk about prosperity,
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.240]   making sure that the country can make money,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.080]   so that it can take care of its needs,
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.400]   and the needs of its citizens,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   then what I have come to find is that at the root of that
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.480]   is gonna be what we call economic freedom,
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.360]   and what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.440]   In that, you can put the rule of law,
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.200]   you can put the concept of clear
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.040]   and transferable property rights.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.920]   Economic freedom is at all the levels,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   that which will allow entrepreneurs and business people
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.960]   to create value, and create value entrepreneurially.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.160]   We're not talking about rent-seeking or anything like that.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.520]   It's like you found a pie to be this big,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.800]   and you make it this big.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.760]   So that's what we're talking about.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.640]   - Create value.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.720]   - Create value, yes.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.960]   So when it comes to that, we have found that,
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.440]   whether you're looking at two countries
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.320]   that started the same, we're talking the same people,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.080]   East Germany, West Germany, South Korea, North Korea,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.040]   very similar people to start with, right?
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.960]   But yet, radical outcomes.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.120]   I know that today, Germany is united,
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.520]   but we're talking about back in the days
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.400]   when you had East and West and block.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.800]   Same people, very different outcomes.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Like I said, South Korea, North Korea,
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.840]   and so on and so forth.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.880]   And at the same time, very different nations.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:45.800]   Dubai, compared to Singapore, or to England,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.440]   very different yet, the same outcome.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.560]   So it seems to me like whenever we're looking at prosperity,
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.480]   if a nation is prosperous,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.800]   regardless of whatever other shenanigan
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.040]   they might be running, whatever other operating software
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.800]   they might be running for anything
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.240]   that's not related to business,
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.840]   if on the business side,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.800]   they are proponents of a free markets
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   or at least base level of free markets,
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.440]   we know that such countries will create prosperity.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.360]   - So what are the aspects of the operating systems
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.840]   that lead to Singapore and to South Korea
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.760]   and all that kind of stuff?
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.080]   So can you speak to different elements
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.000]   that enable the toolkit for entrepreneurs?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.560]   - Sure, sure.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.440]   And maybe here, let me just maybe illustrate it
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.240]   with my own story and then I can take you back to-
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   (laughing)
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.920]   - Magat, tell us your story.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.240]   - No, no. - Who are you?
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.920]   - It's just because it started with me coming here.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   You showed me the robot and everything,
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.480]   and now it looks like we know you for 12 years.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.440]   And then you're like, "Tell people."
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.720]   No, no, no.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.040]   So this is where this question, even when you ask me,
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.600]   how do some countries become prosperous?
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.360]   That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.080]   That's when my family moved me from Senegal.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.160]   For the first time of my life, I left my country,
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.120]   I left my continent, and I was headed to Europe
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.400]   to go join my people, my family, my parents,
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.760]   who were there as economic migrants.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.560]   My parents had migrated for a better life,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.040]   as so many people have to.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.840]   So many people have to, coming from poorer places,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.320]   coming from low-income countries.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.600]   - So you saw the difference?
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.440]   - Yes.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.600]   - Between the two places.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.200]   - How else would you call it?
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.080]   Here you were in Senegal, minding your own business,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.720]   causing tons of trouble everywhere,
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.400]   you know, just being a happy, free-range kid that I was.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.880]   - Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker, not just now.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.280]   - Always. - Okay, great.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.120]   - Life wouldn't be fun without it.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.640]   - Yeah, of course, I agree.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.480]   - Right?
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.320]   So, because even you, you know,
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.680]   like, and you're all put together, like, front.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.880]   I know there's a lot of troublemaking behind you.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.800]   - I'm desperately trying to keep it together.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.200]   - I know you are, but with me,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.560]   I'm going to totally bring it out.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.880]   So just, yeah.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.720]   So...
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.640]   - So you saw the difference.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.560]   - Right, I saw the difference.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.280]   I'm walking in here, back home,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.320]   and I tell people this story,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.360]   because to me, it's a defining story.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.200]   Back home, to take a shower, it takes time.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.720]   Grandma has to, you know, make the charcoal catch
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.960]   on a little stove like you use at,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.600]   you know, when you go camping.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.560]   And then she puts a pot of water on it, it boils.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.600]   She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket,
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.320]   mixes it with some colder water.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   Then we put a little pot in it,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.000]   and a stronger member of the family
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.640]   has to drag it to the shower.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.680]   And then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.720]   Here, I'm in Germany in the middle of the winter,
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.640]   and my mom's like, "My God, time for your shower."
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.280]   I'm like, "I'm not getting naked.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.120]   "Where's the bottle?"
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.960]   I'm like, "It's cold."
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.840]   "Where's the bucket of hot water?"
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.440]   She's like, "Oh, you silly, come on, just jump in."
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.520]   And I jump in the shower, turn the button,
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.800]   the water's coming down, temperature,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.080]   I'm playing with.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.040]   It's like, are you kidding me?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.880]   - So amazing.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.280]   - I've been cheated out of life, my whole life.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.840]   So that's what happened.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.280]   And then I'm like, "Oh, and all of these roads,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.120]   "they're paved roads."
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.680]   I'm like, "Back home, everything is sandy,
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.440]   "and, you know, my feet are always ashy.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.920]   "I always have to wash off when I go back home,
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.640]   "and your shoes get ruined most of the time."
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.280]   And it started, and I had this question,
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.120]   and it was just like, "Wow, how come they have this,
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.800]   "and we don't?"
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   So I was not being like, "Oh, you know,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.480]   "how come they have all of this money?"
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.320]   I was not that.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.640]   It was just like, "How come?"
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.760]   And I think what I was alluding to was,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.320]   "How come life is so easy here, and back home it's not?"
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.200]   - And easy, not in a negative sense.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.280]   In a beautiful sense.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.240]   Sometimes I get, you know, just having traveled
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.200]   through the war zone, just to come back,
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.720]   traveling through Europe, back to America,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.120]   it just, I'll just get emotional just looking
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.520]   at the efficiency of things.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.200]   Like, how easy it is, how we can,
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.360]   first of all, in Ukraine, you currently can't fly, right?
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.240]   It's a war zone.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.440]   Just even the transportation, you said roads.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.520]   Yeah, the quality of roads in the United States is amazing.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.720]   Just not, you know, many of the places
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.920]   that drive in Ukraine, you're talking about,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.280]   I mean, really bad conditions of roads.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   And I'm sure in many parts of Africa,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.720]   in many parts of the world, the roads are even worse.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   - Right, right.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.360]   - And outdoor, you know, having an indoor toilet
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.440]   is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.640]   - It is, it is.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.440]   And don't take me wrong, Lex.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.440]   Do we have some great roads now in many parts of Africa?
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.160]   Yes, main arteries, great roads,
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.960]   you're like, "Whoa, this is moving."
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.720]   Yes, we do.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   But definitely more today than in my time growing up.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.200]   Do we have, you know, a country like Nigeria
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.440]   that just birthed six unicorns last year alone?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   Yes.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.960]   Do we have the African youth out there being so amazing
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.320]   and, you know, living their lives?
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.640]   Yes, we have all of that.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.320]   But it is still unfortunately just,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.520]   like we're scratching the surface.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.560]   And those people still are getting all of that accomplished,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.520]   literally swimming through molasses.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.320]   This is some of the most gross,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:33.400]   immoral, unfair waste of human capital.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.960]   - And so that is the, started with you,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.360]   as a seven-year-old, asking, "Wait a minute,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.360]   how do amazing people in Europe do this
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.640]   and the amazing people in Africa don't?"
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.280]   - Yeah, and that's a key word, amazing,
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.200]   because that's what I realized later,
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.560]   because it was not always like that for me,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.200]   amazing and amazing, right?
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.760]   I knew instinctively that, of course we are amazing too.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.320]   But so this, and then, so eventually the question became,
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.440]   how, so I went from, how come they have this and we don't,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.840]   to the country as I'm growing up and researching,
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.960]   because it stayed with me.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.880]   When I tell you I'm obsessed, I'm haunted.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.000]   I am haunted.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.520]   So you can laugh all you want, but it's,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.080]   so the question became, the question became,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.800]   how come some countries like the United States,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.600]   Singapore are rich and some others like mine
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.080]   and many others in Africa are poor?
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.040]   That became the question.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.320]   And along the line, like along the road,
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.360]   I continued on living my life,
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.880]   wondering about this question.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:50.400]   And I've heard all types of reasons
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.840]   as to supposedly why that might be the case.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.120]   Some people with a very straight face
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.320]   are still peddling the IQ fury, according to which,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.960]   come on, darling, it's not your fault.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.520]   You know, your skin color goes with a gene sequence
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.800]   that just doesn't allow you to be as smart
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.840]   as white people are.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.880]   And it's not your fault, but just accept it.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.280]   That stuff is still out there.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.120]   It's very real.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.760]   And I have to hear it.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.560]   And others would say to me,
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.680]   it's just because, you know,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.440]   you guys don't have adequate level of education.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.200]   And I say, you know, maybe you gotta go say that
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.120]   to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.480]   You go up to any of these,
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.640]   to many of these street sellers in Senegal,
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   they are wading through cars,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.680]   in moving cars under the hot sun,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.840]   fumes thrown at their face,
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.640]   trying to sell you anything
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.360]   and any that you think you might be able to use.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.880]   Whether we're talking about an ironing board,
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.760]   to an umbrella, to Q-tips,
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.840]   to, you know, toothpicks,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.800]   selling you whatever you need from your car.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.360]   These are street sellers.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.760]   And you ask them, dear,
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   do you have any degree?
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.480]   I have this great degree in math
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   or in literature or whatever.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.240]   Some very, very educated people.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.080]   Yet they're right there.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.440]   This is what they're doing.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   - So that's just at scale, wasted human potential.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.400]   - Thank you.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.840]   - So that has to do,
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.000]   the wasted human potential has to do now with the system,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.080]   with something about the laws.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.200]   - Yeah.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.600]   - Something about sort of the things that limit
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.720]   or enable the entrepreneur.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.040]   - Yes.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.920]   Because at that point I've heard this,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.400]   you know, I heard people say,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.560]   yeah, your IQ is no good.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.480]   Yeah, you don't have enough degrees
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.080]   or you're not educated.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.320]   Yeah, some people would even say,
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.720]   it's because you guys are malnourished.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.160]   You're malnourished.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.440]   You need to be fed.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.840]   Others, oh, well, maybe I give you some shoes
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.040]   and maybe something's gonna change, whatever.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.880]   And then, so I heard all of this nonsense, Lex.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.720]   But guess what?
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.560]   But guess what?
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.400]   None of them made sense.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.240]   You know why it didn't make sense?
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.640]   Because if any of that crap was true,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.080]   why, oh why, is it that my parents
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.760]   or any other people from these places?
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.000]   And oh, and by the way,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.120]   some people call those places God-forsaken land.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.520]   That's also the type of critic you always have to hear
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.480]   when it's not just flat out S-H-I-T,
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.440]   whole countries from, you know, one person a few years ago,
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.280]   president of his country.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.600]   - That sentiment is sometimes there.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.280]   - It is, it is.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.640]   As I go on with my life,
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.720]   trying to find the answer to
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.200]   why are some countries like mine poor
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   while others are rich?
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.040]   I'm hearing all of these reasons thrown at me.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.480]   And then they make no sense.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.280]   Because then how come then, if my parents move,
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.960]   as it is usually anyone else who moves from a poorer nation
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.080]   to a nation that supposedly is rich,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.040]   all of a sudden,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.720]   they get to manifest the greatest potential.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.320]   So I'm starting to think this has nothing to do
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.120]   with a person per se,
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.680]   because we're talking about the same person.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   Same background, same everything,
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.040]   same name, features, everything.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.120]   Now I'm starting to think,
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.240]   maybe it doesn't have to do with a person.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.800]   Maybe we're talking about something that has to do
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.480]   with a place that they came from
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.240]   or the place that they're going to.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.400]   So this little thing is starting to be in my mind.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.760]   Again, remember, this is not something
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.160]   that I woke up to overnight.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.200]   I'm like, "Well, ha, I got my quest."
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.400]   It took me for a long time.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.200]   And I had to face off,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.840]   to have many different ideologies face each other.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.280]   I had to really have a reckoning,
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.640]   literally in my heart and in my mind.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.360]   And so then that's what I'm thinking.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.400]   It cannot be, no, no, no, it's the same people.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.320]   It has to be about the place,
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.080]   but then what about this place?
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.600]   But then even about the place,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.400]   you're thinking, again, two countries,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.040]   different backgrounds, same outcome,
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.800]   same background, different outcome.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.080]   What is this?
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.200]   And then I go on.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   I am in Silicon Valley in the late '90s,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.800]   early 2000s, that come boom, all of that.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.720]   And I'm starting to discover this concept
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.000]   of this thing called entrepreneurship.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.280]   I'm in Silicon Valley
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.360]   and just getting to experience
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.800]   what seems so cliche by now,
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.360]   but people getting together in the back of a napkin,
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   just talking about an idea, bringing it out.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.120]   And then they go out and they talk to some investors
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.160]   who's going to invest in it.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.080]   Then they have lawyers who get to put
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.360]   all of this stuff together.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.840]   And then they have the big four CPA firms,
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.040]   this whole ecosystem of what they call of entrepreneurship.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.000]   And then eventually this concept of entrepreneurship
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.400]   being this idea of creating something out of nothing.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.840]   So there I am.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.120]   And at some point I become an entrepreneur myself.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.760]   And the way I became an entrepreneur was not like,
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.520]   I woke up and I'm like,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.360]   I want to make money,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.280]   so I'm going to become an entrepreneur.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.320]   No, and this is also another problem I have
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.640]   with people who have a problem with entrepreneurs
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.240]   or business people.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.960]   Most entrepreneurs do not start a business to become rich.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.760]   Most entrepreneurs start a business
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.160]   because they have found, identified a problem
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.760]   that bothered them enough that they said,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.040]   enough is enough.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.600]   I'm going to do something about it.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.040]   What entrepreneurs are,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.720]   are people who criticize by creating.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.960]   Do they always get it right?
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.800]   No.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.640]   As a matter of fact,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.520]   the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   It's kamikaze path to take the entrepreneurship path.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.000]   We lose our spouses.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.840]   My first husband passed away
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.040]   as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.680]   And yet I had to keep going.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.440]   What force can keep you going
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.600]   after you just loved,
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.960]   lost the love of your life?
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.720]   What force keeps you going?
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.120]   The force of, oh, I just want to be rich.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.680]   Really?
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.640]   When your whole,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.240]   your whole world is upside down,
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.440]   your whole world is upside down
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.320]   and you just want to quit.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.400]   You just want to go meet him and join him in death.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.440]   I stayed, why?
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.800]   Because of the same reason why I started my company.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.960]   I stayed because the women
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.840]   whom I had put back to work by then,
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.720]   we're talking about some of the most vulnerable women
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.000]   in my country.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.240]   These are women who grow the hibiscus,
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.160]   which we need to make the bisap,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.240]   which is the juice of Taronga, remember?
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.880]   This is our national identity drink.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.000]   And for the longest time,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.240]   women grow this hibiscus,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.640]   but we use for the national drink,
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.200]   for this drink.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.040]   And now that Coca-Cola, Pepsi,
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.920]   and all that had made it through the marketing,
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.600]   but it is more cool to drink those beverages.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.280]   Now there is no more market for the hibiscus.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.800]   And with that goes the livelihoods of these women.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.520]   And for me, that bothered me enough
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.960]   because in that force, I saw two things.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.720]   One was a part of my culture.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.120]   We're talking about, I mean,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:10.160]   part of my cultural identity, for Christ's sake.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.280]   The juice of Taronga.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.560]   You asked me, "What defines you?"
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.880]   I said, "Taronga, there's a juice for it."
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.760]   So my culture is disappearing.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.920]   And at the same time,
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.880]   these women are sliding into abject poverty
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   because what they used to make, no one needs anymore.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   So that is what got me to start a company.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.000]   And the company was created just because of that.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.360]   I wanted to build a company
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.720]   that would allow me to not only preserve
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.160]   this very important aspect of my cultural identity,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.440]   and at the same time, put these women back to work.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.440]   - And maybe it's more difficult to put into words,
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.280]   but there's a kind of,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.920]   it's a basic human spirit where you see
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.800]   the place where you came from
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.080]   breaking apart in some kind of way,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.440]   and you have the entrepreneurial fire
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.600]   that dreams of helping.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.440]   - Yes.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   - And sometimes it's hard to convert that into words.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.080]   You have to tell nice stories and so on,
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.320]   but it's the basic human desire to help.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.160]   - Yes.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.280]   - And get criticized by creating.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.880]   - Especially when you've been,
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.160]   especially when, and let's face it,
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.720]   are we all a bundle of circumstances,
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.440]   some happy, some worse?
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.560]   Yes, we are.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.200]   And oftentimes I ask myself,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.040]   my God, why you?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   Why did you get to have the opportunities that you have?
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.320]   What makes you different from, let's say, even your cousin
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.000]   that couldn't, that is still home, trapped?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.480]   Because we call ourselves trapped citizens.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.520]   When you're trapped in these countries that go nowhere,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.080]   we're like a bunch of trapped citizens.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   So you see, Lex, when my husband passed away
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.760]   and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.240]   and to send, investors had already said,
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.040]   we understand if you want to stop.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.680]   Whatever you decide to do, we'll do that.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.920]   And I wanted to quit.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.360]   And I was actually on my way,
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.880]   I was in Senegal for a month,
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.520]   trying to really get a bearing over myself.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   And by the end of the month, I had decided I'm letting go.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.680]   There's no way, the pain was too great.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.200]   Nothing made sense anymore.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.760]   It was too much.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.920]   So I went to see this woman
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   and I talked to the one who, we're talking back then,
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.000]   there were 400 of them.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.520]   Later on, we grew to 9,000.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.800]   And I told the representative of all of them,
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.160]   and I told her, this is very old lady.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.920]   And just looking at her, I knew I was going through some pain
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.600]   but this woman has probably gone through 10 times,
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.320]   not that pain is measurable,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.840]   but you could tell this woman probably lost a child
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.240]   as oftentimes happen in places
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.880]   that are lower income countries.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.280]   Probably lost a husband also,
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.320]   probably who knows, so many people.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.600]   Loss is part of our lives.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.440]   - You could see the pain.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.080]   - You can see the pain, yet she's so, so dignified.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.840]   She's so dignified.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.480]   And that already kind of made me like, my God, stop crying.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.080]   But, and I told her that I was quitting,
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.560]   I could not look her in the eyes.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.720]   And she said, "Look at me."
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.880]   I could not look her in the eyes.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.400]   She said, "Look at me, child."
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.480]   And I looked at her and she said,
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.760]   "You know, I know you're in pain,
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.120]   "but where your husband is, where your beloved is,
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.080]   "there's absolutely nothing that you can do for him.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   "But for us, you can change everything."
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.760]   And I went back.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.920]   So that's what entrepreneurs are.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.320]   At their best.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.200]   - She helped you find your strength?
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   - Yes.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.080]   And I was weak still, but I said,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.240]   "You put that aside, there's a job to do here."
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.880]   And I went back and I fought with everything that I had.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.120]   And this company that I started in my kitchen
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.520]   became this company that had the who's who
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.720]   of a beverage world.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.680]   With at some point, Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo,
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.440]   sitting on my board,
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.480]   yeah, I went back because of that.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.760]   So the reason why I tell this story for me is important,
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.440]   because the world needs to understand
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:48.200]   that there is a viable way of caring
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.720]   and of being part of a solution
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.480]   for the lesser fortunate,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.560]   in terms of not keeping them where they are,
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.280]   and we're like the saviors coming
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.960]   and giving them food and all that.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.840]   But it's like, just like the leg up I got in my life,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.240]   give somebody else a leg up.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.040]   - What are the things you're fighting against in Africa
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.400]   when you try to build a business like that?
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.280]   - So then we're building this company.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.840]   And back then, this was in 2004,
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.800]   that was when I built my first company.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.120]   We had to have two sister companies,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.360]   one there, one here.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.920]   So the one in Africa was about the whole supply chain.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:42.000]   And the one in America was research and development,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.600]   sales and marketing, all of that good stuff.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.520]   And then at some point I look around,
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.200]   I'm like, wait a second,
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.720]   here, back in the days before we had the,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.760]   they would talk, they would say,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.480]   oh, we have this one-stop shop for business registration.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.560]   But the truth is,
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.800]   very quickly you can set up an LLC in the US.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.040]   We're talking about less than, even then,
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.880]   less than, today it's super fast, 20 minutes online, done.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:12.760]   Back then it was less than a few hours to get it done.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.720]   Cost you almost nothing,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.600]   we're talking about a few hundred dollars,
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.360]   three, two to 350, depending which state you are.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.880]   - So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.760]   - No time, no time, no money, almost.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.200]   - You don't have to know a guy that knows a guy
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.280]   that slips some money to the politician and so on.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.640]   - No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.040]   And so at the same time, also things like,
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.680]   and this I can take you into today's day.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.200]   Okay, Lex, I don't know if you have employees on payroll
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.680]   or anything like that.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:50.640]   But do you have to go every month,
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.800]   or anybody listening to us right now,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.040]   do they have to go every single month
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.060]   to three different type of agencies,
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:06.880]   you know, like governmental agencies, to do one step?
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.240]   This one is basically you're gonna go
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.040]   and give them your retirement money,
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.320]   like, you know, like the pension part of the salary
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.440]   that you took out from your employee.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.160]   You have to go to this agency
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.080]   and put that application through.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.880]   So you leave that money behind.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.400]   Then you go to another agency.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.440]   This one is for their health, you know, care, whatever.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.060]   You have three of those places
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.640]   where you have to literally go to in person.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.840]   Three times, three places every single month
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.120]   to drop off these, you know, this paperwork.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.640]   Do you have to do that anywhere in the US?
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.520]   I mean, do we have that situation anywhere
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.160]   that you know of right now?
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.200]   - No, no.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.120]   - And do you think that's business friendly,
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.160]   or do you think it's cumbersome in business?
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.200]   - And that's not just cumbersome sort of physically,
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.360]   it's cumbersome psychologically.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.880]   But there's a feeling like the system around you,
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.780]   yeah, there's a feeling like you're trapped.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.240]   It's a feeling like the system doesn't want you to succeed
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.560]   versus a system that does want you to succeed.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.880]   - Exactly.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.920]   You're in a country like, we're in Texas.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.640]   If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.840]   you know, all you do, five minutes it takes you,
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.440]   you're filing, you know, your state, your franchise tax.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.120]   That's it.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.320]   It's below that number, tell them what it is.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.760]   Then you have nothing to give them
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.200]   or anything like that, you move on.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.920]   Us, even if I make this much,
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.160]   there is a minimum tax that you have to pay,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.600]   which is $1,000 in Senegal right now.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:46.500]   - For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:49.080]   - You make no money.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.920]   - You still have to pay.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.760]   - You still have to pay.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.600]   And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.160]   when we had to try to get the electricity hooked up
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.840]   on our first office.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.360]   So we go, they say, "Oh, first you have to apply."
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.840]   You know, like you normally, you have to apply.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.320]   Then we apply, we pay the money.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.080]   Remember again, here you have to also go,
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.360]   this was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.560]   And then we wait and we wait and we wait.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.880]   And when I say we wait, I'm not talking about
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.440]   we waited 24 hours, we waited 48 hours.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.040]   A month, two months, three months, four months, five months,
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.800]   you go, you send your assistant, she goes, she comes back.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.200]   Well, they say we send it to wait.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.840]   At some point I'm like, I gotta go there.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.560]   So I go there and I asked to speak
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.260]   to the head of the district for, you know,
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.960]   and I'm just like going on and on and on and on
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.280]   about how we've been delayed.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.320]   This is gonna be a problem.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.600]   We have to produce, everything is delayed.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.120]   And I risk losing my business.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.040]   We already pre-sold some of these products to our customers.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.840]   I gotta, something needs to happen.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.040]   So at some point, the gentleman looks at me,
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.520]   he's like, "Lady, look over there."
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.920]   I look over there, I see a pile of paper this high.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.280]   We're talking about maybe hundreds of applications.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.260]   Each one of them is a single, single, single sheet.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.320]   Each single sheet is an application
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.780]   for getting the electricity.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.960]   And he says, "Do you see that?"
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.800]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.740]   And he said, "Look over there."
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.740]   I look over there to the other side.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.440]   I see two meters.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:26.260]   He's like, "Each of these applications needs one of those.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.100]   "How many do you see?"
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.200]   I said, "Two."
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.660]   Then I knew I was in trouble.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:33.700]   And then I said, "What do I do?"
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.500]   And he said, "Lady, it's not at our level."
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.060]   And I agreed with him, it was not on his level.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.940]   But eventually, by now you can tell
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.060]   that I pretty much get what I need because,
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.020]   and at that point what I did was not threaten him
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.860]   or anything like that.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:47.900]   I didn't even pay a bribe or anything,
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.180]   but you could see why people pay bribes.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.140]   Because when you have a pile like that,
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.020]   then the only way to advance your file,
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.980]   and that, by the way, happens even at the passport office.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.540]   You come, you apply for your passport,
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.260]   which is your right.
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.060]   They forced us to have passports.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.940]   It's your right as a citizen to have a passport.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.340]   And even there, if you want yours
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.540]   to keep going through the process,
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.180]   you have to bribe somebody so it can go
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.940]   even the pace it's supposed to go, let alone faster.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:15.220]   So here, I'm thinking I have a problem.
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.420]   And at that point, I did what I do.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.820]   I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.020]   I explained to him why I'm here, why I'm trying to do this.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.340]   And even him said, "Lady, someone like you,
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.360]   "you have no reason to even be here.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.940]   "You could be back in America, living your life,
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.700]   "la vida loca, you don't have to be here."
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:35.300]   So that, I think, gained a lot of his respect.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.300]   And I said, "If you don't help me with this,
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.900]   "I understand I shouldn't be of a priority
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.600]   "or anything like that, but I beg you, I beg of you.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.500]   "I need for this to go on this week."
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.680]   And he said, "Okay."
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.740]   That's how I got my meter.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.700]   One of those two meters became mine.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.580]   So then he said, "But we have a problem."
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.020]   And I said, "What?"
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:57.240]   He said, "Well, the truck, we need the truck
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.820]   "to be here to do it because,
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.840]   "because of where you are from the pole,
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.340]   "we need long cable lines to get it all done.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.760]   "But the truck is, I don't know where the truck was
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.740]   "because they had this one truck for,
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.600]   "I don't know how many customers.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.140]   "So I go to the mayor of a town with whom I'm quite friends
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:17.340]   "because I know people, but it shouldn't be this way.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.420]   "So I go to the mayor of a town."
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.740]   And I said, "Mayor, he happens to have the same name as me.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.500]   "First, last name, same, but except he's the ugly one,
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.020]   "I'm the pretty one because, you know."
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.780]   - Of course. (laughs)
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.300]   That's so people can tell you apart.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.140]   She's the pretty one, right? - Exactly.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.900]   I'm the pretty one and he's the, whatever.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.880]   So I go to the mayor and I'm like,
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.980]   "Mayor, I need your help.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.140]   "You need to help me with this."
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.500]   He's like, "Now what?"
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.900]   And I explained to him and he's like,
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.420]   "Okay, you can take the truck from the city hall.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.740]   "I'll tell the guys that they can allow you to have it.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.420]   "And then they come and then you guys can do this."
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.740]   And then we arrived there.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.580]   Guess what?
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.900]   I thought I was done, Lex, but I was not done
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.900]   because now the electricity company, by the way,
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.260]   whom we paid, everything was there.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.620]   They've been sitting on our money for nine months by now.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.420]   Well, we need a ladder long enough to,
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   you know, like one of the super, super professional ladders
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.180]   that normally the electricity companies have.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:14.540]   Theirs was in some other village
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.200]   and they didn't know if it was gonna be back
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.000]   for another three days or four days.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.780]   I said, "Are you kidding me?"
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.020]   He's like, "No."
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.340]   So I call mayor again.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.500]   I'm like, "Mayor, do you have a ladder?"
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.820]   And I explained and he said,
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   "And that's how I got my electricity hooked up.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.460]   "Otherwise I probably would still be waiting."
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.480]   So, Lex, you add all of these things together.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.580]   And also the fact that in my country, by the way,
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.420]   the labor laws are so stringent.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:44.500]   Basically, you are married to employees for good or for bad.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.720]   And some people say,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.680]   "Oh no, you're not married for good or for bad,
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.640]   "except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   "to get rid of any of them.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.300]   "It doesn't matter the circumstances."
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.980]   Do you think an entrepreneur
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.980]   really needs to hear something like that?
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.420]   The head of the ILO, I had an argument with him at the UN.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:04.820]   And I said to him, "Listen, and you listen to me very well.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:09.820]   "The reason if you want to protect employees,
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.120]   "as you claim, everything you're doing
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.920]   "is to protect employees.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.340]   "A, you know better of a human being than I am
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.840]   "in terms of wanting to make sure
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.260]   "that people are treated right and fairly.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:24.980]   "But last time I checked, Google, for example,
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:28.420]   "is not offering their employees chef-cooked meals,
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.560]   "super healthy, anything they want,
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.340]   "feeding them from morning till evening,
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:39.340]   "having some babysitters, or having childcare on site,
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.720]   "all of these perks that come on top
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.580]   "of really cozy salaries."
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:46.220]   It did not happen because you, the ILO,
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.100]   told them you have to do this.
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.860]   It happened because there are enough jobs created around
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.180]   that now you're in an employee's market
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.980]   and employers have to fall all over themselves
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.900]   to attract the best talent among us.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.020]   That's how it's done.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.620]   And not with your nonsense
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.540]   that you're imposing me right now,
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:07.480]   which the only results you're gonna get,
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.820]   like in my country,
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.740]   do you know what we have to show for all of these,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.660]   the fact that the Senegalese employees,
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.780]   the most protected employee on paper in the world?
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.380]   Well, we're one of the 25 poorest countries in the world.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.760]   That's what it got us.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:26.720]   - So let's try to untangle this.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.580]   So there's a system in place.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.940]   There's a momentum with that system.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.740]   Like you said, "Lady, it's not my level,"
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.240]   which is, for somebody who grew up in the Soviet Union,
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:42.300]   at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.740]   from people I knew there.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.060]   It's kind of this helpless feeling like,
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.220]   well, this is just part of the system,
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.540]   this gigantic bureaucracy.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.320]   And the corruption that happens
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.540]   is just like the only way to get around
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.940]   to get anything done.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:01.260]   And so the corruption grows.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.300]   Maybe could you speak to the corruption?
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:08.820]   To what degree is there corruption in Senegal and Africa?
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.100]   And how do we fix it?
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.100]   - So when you said to which degrees there is corruption,
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.340]   I will respond to you the same I respond to people.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.960]   I say, yeah, we have corruption,
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.140]   and it's almost as bad as in Chicago.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:27.080]   So now, what I want people to understand
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.880]   when it comes to corruption,
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.300]   it's because we are misguided with corruption.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.700]   We think corruption is the root cause of problems,
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.460]   when corruption is simply a symptom
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.120]   of the deeper root problem.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.300]   In this case,
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:50.860]   if you make the laws so senseless,
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:56.020]   meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.140]   Every time I have to import something in my country,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.340]   I have a business, we're making lip balms in this case,
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.100]   and others, skincare products.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.160]   Some ingredients I'm able to find in the country
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.120]   at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.040]   Because for example, our products are sold
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.000]   Whole Foods Market, you can understand,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.600]   it's a pretty sophisticated and really,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.620]   you know, they don't just put anybody on the shelves.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.040]   But the thing is, it means that on the other end,
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.160]   my inputs has to be right.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.040]   So out of those, some, we have seven ingredients,
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.440]   seven items that need to come from abroad
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.680]   to go into the making of this product.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.080]   Some packaging and some raw material.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.080]   But guess what, Lex, for five of them,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.920]   I am paying a 40% tariff,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.560]   and for the other two, almost 70% tariff.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.920]   That I call senseless laws.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.040]   These tariffs are senseless.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.040]   - Yeah, corruption is just a symptom.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.440]   They reveal that something is broken about the laws.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.280]   - Exactly.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.020]   - And the laws are, so taxation,
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   this kind of restricting laws,
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.560]   laws that slow down the entrepreneurial momentum.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.000]   - They do, they do.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.280]   Because in this case, when my product comes,
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.640]   what do people have to do?
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.400]   Because every time, if you add 40%,
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.720]   you're basically on the other end.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.400]   So every time you add,
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.640]   if let's say my product normally cost a dollar,
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.880]   and we feel 40%, by the time I'm done,
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.640]   I had to pay, now it's costing me 140.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.000]   By the time it arrives in my warehouse,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   in my manufacturing facility,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.800]   it's now at 140 because of a tariff I left behind.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.240]   That 40% you added to it,
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.960]   do you know how much it's gonna add to my final cost
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.200]   that once the product is finished,
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.160]   I have to sell it to the customer?
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.400]   I have to sell it for $1.60 more
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.920]   because of that 40 cents extra you took from me.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.880]   In order for me at the end of the day
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.520]   to have some type of profits,
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.920]   because profits at the end of the day
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.320]   is the blood of a business,
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.000]   there are two people are misguided.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.760]   They say, "Oh, you dirty, greedy business people,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.360]   "and it's all about profit, profit, profit, profit."
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.600]   You know, I belong to this organization called,
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.120]   I'm a board member on the Conscious Capitalism.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.280]   It is the largest organization
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.800]   of purpose-driven businesses and entrepreneurs.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.120]   The type of people I told you about,
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.200]   we start our businesses because we see something
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.600]   that needs to be taken care of in society.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.640]   Whole Foods Market is one of them,
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   The Container Store, you know,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.120]   all of these companies that are beloved in the US
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.840]   that you can hear of.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.840]   We believe that the end goal of business is purpose.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.600]   But in order to do purpose,
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   you have to have profits to stay alive.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.160]   And the best way for people to think of profits
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.080]   so that they're not all twisted about it,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.440]   Lex, if I asked you, what's your goal in the world?
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.960]   You're probably gonna tell me your dream.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.320]   You're gonna talk to me about what you're doing right now
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.240]   and how you want to be uniting,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.640]   you want a more harmonious world.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.320]   You want human flourishing.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.920]   That's what you're working towards.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.360]   That's what you say to me.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.120]   You're not gonna say, "Well, my biggest goal in the world
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.320]   "is to produce as many red blood cells as I can."
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.120]   Except you need to produce those, otherwise, no Lex.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.160]   And if no Lex, no one working.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.000]   - Yeah.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.840]   - You know what I mean?
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.680]   - Yeah.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.520]   - So that's all.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.040]   So people need to stop with this whole profit, non-profit.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.520]   Do we have some psychopaths among us?
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.840]   Yeah, 1% of us in this world are psychopaths.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.360]   In every field, anywhere you look.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.440]   And surely you find that
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.120]   in the entrepreneur's world as well.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.880]   Yeah, so we have 1% of us who are psychopaths for sure.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.280]   But do they define the rest of us?
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.400]   Absolutely not, and thankfully not.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.000]   So let's just be clear on that.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   So here, you charge me 40% tariff, which is outrageous.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.160]   Then you're forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.880]   than my competitor who does not have to go
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.000]   for that nonsense because she's an American woman
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.160]   who is operating in America
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.280]   and she doesn't have that nonsense put on her.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.800]   So now I'm on this market competing against this woman,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.400]   eye to eye.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.720]   So if we're selling the same value product,
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.080]   mine costs $1.60 more simply because of some stupid rules
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.760]   from back home, then guess who is gonna stay in business
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.600]   and who does it?
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.760]   See, they wanna talk about equality.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   That's the type of equality I wanna see.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.200]   The playing field has to be leveled.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.320]   Told you English is my fourth language.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.960]   - Well, it's two people talking.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.040]   (laughing)
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.560]   Between us, maybe we'll have this English thing figured out.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.440]   - We'll have it figured out.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.760]   - So the idea of capital,
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.600]   the idea of conscious capitalism is the thing
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.920]   that in large part enables this level playing field.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.000]   - That's what we want.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.360]   - So what you're trying to say,
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.440]   so here, so when I talked about census laws,
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.360]   that's an example.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.080]   So when you make the tariffs so high
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.080]   that you're gonna render me non-competitive,
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.280]   then that's where, for people who might make sense,
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.160]   when the product arrives at port,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.200]   they say, "Hey, I give you this.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.400]   "What I give you, maybe it's 10% of the price or 5%.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.080]   "It's surely not 40%, but you are happy with it.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.600]   "You're the government official."
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.200]   That's what we call a bribe.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.920]   And me, I'm like, "Hey, I saved myself money.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.560]   "And also I saved myself time."
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.800]   But you see, if the laws where you pay 5%
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.960]   or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing,
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.720]   you come, you pay it, you move on.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.480]   Because who has the business of fooling around
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.680]   and staying behind?
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.840]   No, you do that when it actually makes sense to do that.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.520]   So I'm not sitting here telling people
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.440]   I engage in unlawful practices.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.280]   In my case, because I'm around saying the things
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.840]   I'm saying right now, so I'm a target.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.080]   You have to do things cleanly.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.680]   And I believe in doing things that way.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:08.080]   So what I had to do was go to the, ask again, mayor.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.200]   We have a problem.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.360]   Mayor, whenever he sees me, he's like, "Now what?"
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.040]   (laughing)
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.360]   So I'm like, "We've got a problem."
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.440]   - Your best friends now.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.520]   - Yes.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.000]   So I say, "Now it's the customs."
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.040]   And he's like, "What do you want me to do?"
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.360]   I said, "Do you know anybody at customs?
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.600]   "I need to hire up at customs
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.560]   "because I got to explain to them what's going on here."
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.880]   They all know, of course,
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.520]   but I think they're not always maybe understanding,
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.440]   or maybe they understand.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.800]   And in this case, he understood.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.600]   So we went and he's like, "Yeah, I know.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.920]   "This is not, this is not very, yeah, this."
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.440]   And I said, "What do we do now?"
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.280]   And I saw him going through binders and binders
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.840]   in his office because he's going to try to go
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.520]   and look where in the law can we find something
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.520]   that can help me escape these rules.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.160]   And you know the best he found, Lex, was,
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.760]   "Oh, well, here, see, this one.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.000]   "If you've been in business for two years,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.600]   "then we can allow you,"
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.280]   there is a special term for it, it's French, it's technical.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.840]   "We can allow you to bring your raw material,
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.120]   "but you have to tell us exactly how much you're bringing.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.800]   "And it has to match your formulation,"
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.760]   because they don't want you to bring in more
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.880]   that we need and maybe sell some of that
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.920]   to the rest of the market
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.120]   and they didn't make their money on it.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.040]   So there, it means I have to give them my recipe.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.800]   Imagine Coca-Cola being asked to give their secret sauce
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.960]   to government officials in a country
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.280]   that you can't even know what might happen,
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.920]   let alone, even in business, you don't do that.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.960]   I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.440]   But here, you're asked to be putting it in front
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.680]   of some people you don't know where it's going to go
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.680]   after that, because there, they get to see,
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.640]   "Okay, her recipe calls for X amount
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   "of candelilla wax, X amount of coconut oil, okay."
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:58.680]   And on top of that, we have to think about
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.400]   how much spoilage might there be or not,
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.520]   because again, we don't want her to buffer over there.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.480]   So you have to get naked in front of them
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.280]   in terms of your recipe, which might end up
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.760]   only God knows where tomorrow,
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.040]   maybe a competition or maybe even them,
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.560]   they start a business and they compete with you,
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.640]   'cause we've seen that.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.200]   So you have to do that.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.000]   And then each time, fill out a paperwork,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.440]   get the approval, then it can come in.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.800]   So when it can come in, you don't have to pay that tax.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.000]   Oh, and by the way, you have one year,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.880]   one year to make this product and get it out.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.720]   And all of it needs to be back out,
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.520]   because if any of it stays here,
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.160]   you're going to pay the taxes that we held up.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   - So you're basically forced by these senseless laws
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.680]   to be dishonest.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.720]   - Backward corruption, all of this is so cumbersome
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.360]   because it means more paperwork, paperwork everywhere,
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.040]   maybe having to disclose your things.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.000]   So me, in my case, what I did is, you know,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.760]   this person said, "Okay, we're going to see
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.960]   how we can work with you."
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.600]   But for the first two years,
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.680]   we were more or less in the gray area.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.240]   - Yeah, so even gray area is good.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.840]   - Yeah, but what does it mean?
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.200]   In a situation like that,
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.280]   whenever they want to mess with you,
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.560]   it means they can come and they will look
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.280]   and they will find something.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.680]   So it means that every day I'm trying to do business,
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.920]   I'm running the risk of being harassed
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.360]   and/or maybe even put in jail, depending on what it is.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.840]   - I mean, you're an incredible person
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.680]   because it seems like there's two ways to change this,
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:34.360]   become president or gain power in the country
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.120]   and to try to change the laws,
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.760]   which seems really difficult to do.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.160]   And the other way is fight through the laws
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.040]   and create the business anyway,
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.560]   build the business community
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.040]   and through that method, create a huge amount of pressure
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.880]   to change the laws.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   - You're totally getting it with your last part
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.400]   because this is the other thing.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.480]   And this is where I get so upset sometimes
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.440]   with my fellow Africans
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   because they get so disgusted by what they're seeing.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.160]   And they think the answer is to go for politics.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.320]   Let's go be president.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.760]   Let's go be this, let's go be that.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.000]   And we're going to change everything.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.480]   I see that in the US too.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.960]   People thinking that presidents have all of this power.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.560]   Do you know who has the least power in government?
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.600]   The president.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.560]   I mean, people don't get that.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   Your best bet, if you insist on going into politics,
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.360]   stick to the local level.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.320]   That's where all the skeletons are buried and hidden.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.200]   And that's where you can make the most impact, local level.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.120]   I know it's not shiny.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.600]   I know it's not exciting, but that's where it's at.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.880]   So if you must go into politics, but there's another way.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.120]   So in my case, what I do is two things.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.880]   I preach and I practice.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.240]   I preach, when I'm here talking to you about this,
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.360]   I'm preaching.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.120]   I am sharing with people that is which I found.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.280]   And by the way, the answer was there.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.880]   I was doing these two businesses,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.880]   realizing the difference in treatment
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.200]   of the doing business environment of the US
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   compared to the doing business environment of Senegal.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.040]   And at first I was like, of course,
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.680]   us, everything is messed up.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.480]   It's because we're a poor country.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.680]   But when I started to put two and two together,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.040]   I'm like, you're poor because you have no money,
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.720]   at least not enough money to take care of your basic needs.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.720]   You have no money because you have no source of income.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.120]   Where does a source of income come from for most of us?
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.520]   It comes from a job, doesn't it?
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.200]   And then some people sometimes at my UC Berkeley class,
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.080]   they say, "Oh no, it comes from government too."
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.000]   I'm like, I would like to think that even if you work
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.480]   for government, you're going to be paid something, right?
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.320]   And they're like, yeah.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.800]   And then even before I can say something, they're like,
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.760]   "Oh yeah, because that money we used to pay
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.240]   our public officials comes from taxes,
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.280]   employers, employees, we go back to the private sector
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.920]   for most of it, from where this whole thing is created."
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.040]   So it's clear, you're poor because you have no money,
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.520]   no money because no source of income,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.280]   source of income for most of us is a job.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.920]   We're talking about, so where do jobs come from?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.000]   The private sector, primarily small
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.520]   and medium-sized enterprises.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.480]   Then don't you think that we should make it easy,
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   that we should have friendly doing business environment?
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.200]   - And also a lot of it comes not just
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.360]   from the small and medium-sized businesses,
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.240]   but I think a lot of the value is created
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.320]   from new ones being launched.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.160]   - Yes.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.200]   - Right, it's not just like saving somehow
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.120]   through regulation, the ones that are already there.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.480]   - No, no.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.120]   - It's like letting the market,
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.400]   letting the new, better ideas flourish.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.000]   - Yes, it's about what I mean by doing business environment
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.320]   is all the things that you and I talked about earlier.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.560]   Even the access of electricity is part of doing business.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.600]   But doing business, so basically when I've discovered
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.080]   all of that, when I put all of those dots together,
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.440]   then I'm like, "Well, I guess the business,"
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.960]   and it makes sense, Lex.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.680]   If you want to grow tomatoes,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.120]   you're going to have to have two things.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.960]   One is a good seed, right, that has good attributes,
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.720]   and then you're going to have to have
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.560]   a good environment for it.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.440]   Is the soil the right one?
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.200]   What's your pH level?
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.120]   All of those good nutrients that you're going to put in it.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.200]   Is it in a place that has tons of sun?
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.960]   How much sun exposure or not?
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.520]   The climate in general, is it going to be cold?
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.440]   Not, not.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.120]   You can't have some beautiful tomatoes
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.360]   in the middle of Siberia, last time I checked.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.480]   So same thing here.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.040]   You know, Mohammed Yunus, the Nobel Laureate for Peace,
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.600]   said, "Poor people are bonsai people.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.320]   "They're the same people.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.640]   "If you put them in the normal, natural,
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.600]   "friendly habitat where they can thrive,
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.560]   "they become the tallest tree in the forest.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.400]   "Poor people are bonsai people."
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.440]   So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree?
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.920]   That's the tiny pot that's created
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.000]   by giving me such a hostile business environment
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.400]   that basically were put together by the set of laws
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.960]   that you have put, that basically I have to jump through
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.800]   as a business person, practicing business in my country.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   If you turn that environment into a friendly environment
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.640]   where I am not married to my employees,
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.160]   I have flexibility of the labor laws
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.880]   are simple, straightforward, clean,
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.600]   where the tax code is very simple.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.440]   It's not worth truckloads of laws,
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.600]   like in my country, it's so complicated.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.080]   You have to hire a CPA, which costs more money.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.280]   And even them tell them,
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.640]   "Girl, we're gonna make some mistakes."
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.880]   They don't talk to me like that.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.200]   It's in our country, you know, they don't say,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.520]   "Girl, they shouldn't, they better not."
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.440]   But they say, whatever they say.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.760]   - I'm scared, I'm scared.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.600]   - You know?
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.880]   (laughing)
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.360]   You know, they're like, "We're gonna,
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.640]   "but bottom line is, we're gonna make mistakes.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.360]   "This thing is so complicated, we're gonna make mistakes.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.960]   "So which means, my ass is on the line."
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.000]   So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.520]   straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas,
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.360]   where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing,
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.360]   go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes,
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.720]   you're compliant, keep building your business,
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.080]   'cause that's what we need from you.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.840]   If you made it so easy and straightforward,
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.800]   then you know what?
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.720]   That's when you get all of these people,
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.800]   like what you're talking about, saying,
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.640]   "You know what?
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.240]   "My name is Aminata,
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.480]   "and I live in the middle of nowhere, Senegal,
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.320]   "but you know what?
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.400]   "I've got this great idea for this really hot,
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.720]   "nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are gonna love.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.320]   "I'm hearing that hot sauce is a big thing.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.840]   "Let me bring it to them."
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.560]   But everything is there for you to jump
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.000]   into the ring of entrepreneurship.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.160]   You don't have to know someone like my God.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   You don't have to even have the ability to sell yourself,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.200]   maybe like I can sometimes.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.120]   You are someone with a great idea.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.320]   You're willing to work hard for it
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.840]   and pour everything you got into it.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.680]   Guess what?
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.040]   It's there.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.360]   You can get into the race.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.960]   - You can be a dreamer,
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.720]   and you can be a dreamer in a rural little village,
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.520]   and then that has ripple effects
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.640]   throughout the entire country.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.120]   Young kids growing up,
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.760]   I wanna be the next X, whatever.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.800]   And it doesn't have to be the next Steve Jobs.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.920]   That seems really far, far away.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.600]   - It's at all levels.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:28.600]   You create local heroes because representation matters.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.840]   And we are so badly in need of that.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.120]   And so that's what all the things
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.320]   that have been stolen from us
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.280]   as long as things remain the same.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.800]   So Lex, once I found out that basically at the end of the day
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.040]   the answer is economic freedom,
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.440]   and that when it comes to that,
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.960]   the economic indexes that measure that,
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.600]   whether it's the Dream Business Index ranking
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.560]   of the World Bank,
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.360]   or the Fraser Economic Freedom Index
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.040]   of the Heritage Foundation,
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.720]   when you look at all of those indexes and others,
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.520]   what do they have in common?
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.120]   One after another, they show you
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.160]   that it is harder to do business
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.080]   in almost anywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.040]   than it is per se anywhere in Scandinavia.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.440]   So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations,
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.000]   that socialist Americans tend to love so much
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.040]   and take as an example,
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.200]   although there too they're showing you
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.040]   that they don't understand
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.600]   what's going on really in Scandinavia,
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.840]   that Scandinavia is more capitalist.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.840]   Scandinavian nations are more capitalist
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.880]   than almost any Sub-Saharan African nations.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.680]   - Ultimately, the political systems
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.840]   actually don't even matter nearly as much
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.520]   as the private sector being able
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.080]   to operate the machinery of capitalism.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:44.960]   - There you go.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.000]   There you go.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   There you go.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.920]   And it's almost like, like I said,
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.600]   it's almost like its own little widget within it.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.240]   You can have whatever type of society
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.320]   you wanna exercise at whatever level you want to.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.120]   But if you're serious about becoming
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.440]   a middle to high income nation,
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.560]   there is no other pathway that we know of at this point.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.120]   And you know what made me super excited about that
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.040]   beyond having finally found my answer?
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   I have to tell you, when I found that answer,
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.000]   I literally fell to my knees.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.120]   It was the type of feeling that,
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:28.160]   you know, if something is not well with you,
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.280]   whether it's physical or mental,
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.640]   something is not well, you're not well.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.400]   And you go around and you go to the so-called specialists,
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.120]   some of them, you know,
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.040]   but you're going around for years,
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.720]   going around trying to get help for your ailment.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.560]   And here they don't know.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.360]   Here they tell you things that you can't tell why,
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.200]   but you just know it's not true.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.800]   There this, there that,
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.200]   and it's going on for years after year after year.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:59.200]   And finally you meet this one person and boom, it's there.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.720]   Not only the liberation,
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.680]   but also this whole new world that comes with it.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.680]   You know, I'm still ill, but guess what?
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.400]   There's a path forward.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.120]   We know that.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.880]   I'm going to have a lot of work to do, but there's hope.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.720]   - Yeah.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.560]   - Right?
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.800]   - And you're the beacon of hope actually
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.720]   for a lot of people in that part of the world.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.240]   And those beacons are actually really necessary.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.520]   So not only is there hope, but you can become,
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:37.520]   I mean, the beacon for your people, your home,
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.840]   this power that you see, that you feel all around
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   to escape the feeling of being trapped.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.240]   Is there a device you can give to people that,
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.240]   to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.920]   of how to change the world?
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.800]   - That's right.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.040]   And by the way, I want to say there are bigger beacons,
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.160]   there are better beacons than me.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.920]   I just happen to be someone who has the chance
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.400]   of talking to you right now.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.520]   And one of my goals is to open the same doors
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.520]   that were open for me, because together, our voice,
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.280]   there's such amazing stories out there.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.280]   And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.400]   One thing here for me, the reason why
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.280]   I do what I'm doing right now,
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.560]   and it's almost to a point of self-destructing my own health,
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.000]   I feel invested with such the mission of,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.440]   I have been afforded the truth,
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.880]   so it is my moral duty to try to take it around.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.040]   I know I sound, people sometimes say,
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.720]   when I listen to you, I feel like I'm talking to a priest.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:57.560]   And I'm like, because the gospel, I receive the gospel.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.360]   So anyway, but the thing is, Lex,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.880]   who tells you these things to this day?
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:05.720]   When they talk about the poverty of Africa,
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.920]   what do they talk about?
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.920]   They sit in front telling you,
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.320]   oh yeah, it's because of colonialism,
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.040]   it's because of racism, it's because of imperialism,
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.360]   it's because they're stealing raw material, blah, blah, blah.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   Is any of those guilty to some level of where we are today?
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.360]   Maybe part of a reason where we are today?
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.280]   Maybe, maybe.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.920]   Is that the only reason or the overwhelming reasons?
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.920]   No.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.440]   Is that insurmountable?
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.840]   Absolutely not.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.400]   So for me, don't stay in that place
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.600]   of that steals and robs you of your agency.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.240]   So I think it's important for people
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.160]   to A, get the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.360]   Because what you and I just talked about,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.000]   the mainstream does not talk about this
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.920]   when they even talk about Africa
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.960]   in terms that are not the usual suspect of,
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.920]   oh, famine is building over there,
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.000]   war is building over here,
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.160]   oh, we're having Ebola is coming, all of that stuff.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160]   Even when they were talking about the monkeypox,
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.920]   which at first, in this wave,
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.000]   it started with white people in Europe.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.200]   Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out,
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.080]   it's black people with monkeypox on their skin.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.840]   I'm like, wait a second, this time around,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.440]   we, it did not start with us.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.240]   So why are you always showing us
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:22.160]   when it's right now happening to white people?
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.480]   So all of that is happening.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.760]   So for me, the thing is,
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   we, the world simply right now,
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.480]   does not have the right diagnosis
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.640]   as to why this continent right now,
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.600]   despite all of its riches,
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.320]   because Lord knows it's got riches,
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.560]   starting with its young population.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.440]   75% of the population in my country
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.680]   is below the age of 25 years old.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.120]   So when we're talking, I know we're talking about,
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.960]   you know, repopulation, you know, is important.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.560]   We're gonna have to go for that.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.040]   Maybe you'll get me going about climate change,
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.440]   I don't know, but anyway.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.760]   So here, my point is,
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.200]   A, we need the right diagnosis
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.560]   as to why this continent
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.280]   is the poorest continent in the world,
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.080]   despite its riches, starting with its young people,
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.920]   all the natural resources, diversity in land,
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.880]   people, cultures, languages,
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.720]   everything that make for great ingredient for awesomeness.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.920]   Despite all of that,
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.680]   we are the poorest region in the world.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.880]   People need to know that the reason why that is,
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.000]   it's because we also happen to be
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.800]   the most over-regulated region in the world.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.120]   At the end of the day, what Africa,
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.400]   and I dare to say Africa here,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.360]   and treated as one,
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.560]   we are 54 countries, 55 depending on how you count,
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.560]   yet we almost, for a tiny minority of these countries,
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:48.440]   we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.640]   that there are.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.040]   If you're serious about prosperity building,
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.680]   we lack economic freedom.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.160]   - And economic freedom is the thing
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.000]   that unlocks that human potential,
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.920]   the young people just-- - Yes.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.520]   - For them to run, to run with their ideas,
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.680]   to start businesses, or to start initiative.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.240]   It doesn't have to be for profit all the time, right?
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.000]   But it is this thing that gets you to get up
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.320]   and go and do something, criticize by creating.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.960]   Young people are naturally wired
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.640]   to want to criticize by creating.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.240]   They're not sitting around waiting or complaining usually,
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.600]   unless you put them in a tiny box
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.080]   and they have no other way to go.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.320]   And in this situation, what they do,
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.560]   let's talk about pre-colonial Africa,
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.440]   of four fathers before slavery ever happened,
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.680]   there were black people on the continent.
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.040]   You see, when we talk about the story of black people
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.360]   and Africans, black people in Africa,
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.080]   for most of us, even me,
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.360]   I noticed that unconsciously, it starts with slavery.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.520]   But you're like, no, we were there before,
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.800]   before white men ever set foot.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.760]   Who were we?
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.840]   What were we doing in our diversity?
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.880]   What economic systems were we running on?
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.800]   And then you realize that for most of them,
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.480]   they were free marketeers
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.040]   and they were very much on the free trade,
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.760]   on the free enterprise side.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.720]   So even that is a reinforcement.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.240]   This is a place where we do not understand our history.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.640]   So proper diagnosis,
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.320]   Africa is the poorest region in the world
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.720]   because it happens to be the most over-regulated region
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.240]   in the world, lacks economic freedom.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.960]   Number two, what do we do about that?
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.480]   We got to become serious about reforms,
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.320]   economic reforms,
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.280]   so that we can become beacons of free markets.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.760]   Just like the Asian tigers,
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.320]   that's what the Asian tigers did.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.640]   They had to become serious.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.120]   Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.480]   those guys had to become serious about the free markets.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.680]   Lee Kuan Yew, when he's just like,
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.080]   "We got to do something."
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.240]   And he looked around and he realized at some point,
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.640]   "We got to make these reforms."
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.600]   And he went on to that journey of reforms,
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.440]   making his country one of the most free market countries
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.280]   in the world.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.520]   And voila, the magic happened.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.280]   Back in the '30s, the stock market crash
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.520]   and the Great Depression and everything,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.720]   the world, and with all the lies that were told
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.440]   to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin,
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.800]   while they were starving and dying over there,
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.000]   but oh no, I mean, Durante was telling the world that,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.560]   "Oh no, no, everything is going well.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.520]   Nobody's dying when we know now."
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.840]   And getting political prices based on this stuff.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.400]   But then the world went on believing that,
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.960]   "Oh no, capitalism failed.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   This crash that you had in the stock market is proof.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:41.200]   This is what late stage capitalism produces.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.240]   You guys always have your big ups and downs."
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.080]   And by that time, it was so hard on people
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.680]   that they're like, "We're done with this."
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.560]   And at the same time, we're told the lies
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.400]   coming out of the Soviet Union
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.200]   that supposedly the communism was doing just fine.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.560]   And you're at the point where the free market concept
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.560]   almost died and it's the Asian tigers
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.520]   who kind of helped bring that idea back to life, right?
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.920]   Their success having used the free markets.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.640]   And so for me, we gotta make a new commitment
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.040]   to the free markets on this continent
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.680]   if we wanna go anywhere, if we wanna go anywhere.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.720]   - And the timing is perfect because the young people,
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.720]   there is a kind of freedom for the revolutionary
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.800]   free markets in this whole space.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.560]   - Exactly, and you said something,
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.760]   oh, say that again, because I wanna tell you
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.840]   what I'm hearing in that,
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.760]   'cause something's really cool.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.000]   Say it again, come on, Lex.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.080]   - I don't know which part.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.520]   English is my second language too.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.680]   - No, you said there's something revolutionary in that.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.520]   'Cause you know how young people
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.320]   are attached to the revolution and how,
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.760]   I understand, look, Lex, I understand
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.000]   and I am willing to give the benefits of a doubt
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.800]   to some of these socialists who came to it
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.760]   because they had to witness some of the horrors
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.080]   of their times.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.280]   - There's a revolutionary spirit behind that.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.840]   It's ultimately criticized by creating.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.400]   - Exactly, exactly, but violent revolution
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.760]   is never the answer.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.240]   But that's what they went for in 1789 in France,
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.800]   you know, the French revolution.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.920]   And then Marx and Engels, they're promoting these ideas
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.120]   that usually for them justifies violent revolution.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.560]   Then in all of these people,
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.080]   I am with them when they say that they want
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.080]   to see equal rights for people.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.480]   Of course, I don't agree with their,
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.040]   therefore we need to push for equal outcomes.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.800]   Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not, right?
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.120]   But I am with them for all the way to equal rights,
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.840]   but this is where the two paths go this way.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.280]   And also, the fact that they have no issue
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.200]   with violent revolution, that people get killed,
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.280]   you know, people get put in gulags and people get,
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.600]   that's not right.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.880]   So what you just said here just gives me goosebumps
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.960]   because there is revolution in the free markets,
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.800]   but that's the type of revolution we want.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.280]   The revolution that comes from people creating,
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.720]   criticizing by creating, it's one of the best forms
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.560]   of revolution.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.880]   If you ask me, that's the most sexy way of revolution.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.040]   Criticize by creating.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.640]   But what, you're gonna go shoot people
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.520]   or be like, what's his name?
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.320]   The Che Guevara who tells you, I love,
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.520]   it's in writing, I love nothing more than to fry
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.080]   the brain of a man with his gun?
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:30.920]   Really?
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:35.680]   - Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in that message
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy that has abused
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.320]   their power, they need to be destroyed.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.720]   And there's power in the message of that violence.
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.520]   Unfortunately, the lessons of history show
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:53.200]   that the violence, one, doesn't work,
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:56.000]   but it does the following.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.520]   There is something about human nature,
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.640]   as the old cliche goes, that power corrupts
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.720]   and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.600]   It's the people who are in charge of committing
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.800]   that violence, it does something to their head.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.960]   The first person you kill, the second person you kill,
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   for some reason, you lose your ability,
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.120]   the compassion for other humans.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.560]   Even if you began as a revolutionary,
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.360]   as the Soviets did, fighting for the worker,
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.520]   for the rights and the basic humanity
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   of the people that really do the work,
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:33.640]   you lose the plot somehow because of the violence.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.600]   So in that way, it seems like the lesson,
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.800]   at least of this part of the human history,
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   until the robots take over, is that the economic freedom,
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.880]   free markets, and protecting those,
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   and allowing anyone from your country to dream
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.320]   and to make that dream a reality by creating it
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.320]   with as few roadblocks as possible.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.640]   - Exactly, so that's why for me,
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.680]   the message is very clear, is what we talked about today.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.680]   The reason why Africa is the poorest region in the world
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.240]   is because it happens to be the most overregulated region
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:18.160]   in the world, and for some people who might be put off by it
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.680]   because they're like, "Oh, she's talking about laissez-faire!"
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.920]   No, let me put it maybe in a way that you can understand.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:28.280]   Do you think that it should be as easy
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.040]   for any person in Africa, for any entrepreneur in Africa
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.000]   to enterprise than it is for any person
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.360]   in Scandinavia to enterprise?
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.200]   If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.120]   then you have a moral obligation to work with me
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.320]   to make my country and as a whole,
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.520]   my continent more free markets.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.440]   It's that simple.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.000]   At that point, there's no like,
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.800]   "Yes, but on the other hand, uh-uh, no."
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.840]   As for me, on that question,
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.280]   and I've yet to find somebody who claims to say no.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.480]   If you say no, then we have a whole nother problem.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.240]   I'm not even talking to you at that point anymore.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.080]   So, yeah.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.560]   - So, just to clarify, there's a perception
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.360]   and some reality that the Scandinavian countries
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.960]   have elements of socialism in their politics
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.360]   and their society, even in their economics.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.600]   So, at the very least, Africa should have,
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.240]   in terms of economic indices,
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.720]   should be as free as the Scandinavian countries.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.560]   You're just giving that example.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.120]   - As economically free, yes.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.760]   Because the Scandinavian, they do have
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:34.520]   a subsidized welfare system,
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.600]   that's a more socialized welfare system,
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.200]   but the way they make their money
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.440]   is very much the way of the free markets.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.200]   So, there is how you make your money,
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.680]   and then there's how you maybe decide
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:49.040]   as a country to redistribute it, right?
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:54.040]   And so, even there, even in Scandinavia,
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.560]   again, yes, they have more economic freedom.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.600]   So, then from there, Lex, where we go is,
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.960]   my job and my goal is for every single African,
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.480]   young and old,
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:12.160]   to know what I have come to learn.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:14.320]   We are not doomed.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.640]   It's not over for us.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.240]   We will never catch up.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:24.760]   The time for catch up is gone, but guess what?
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.600]   We've got a strong, strong possibility
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.000]   and chance to leapfrog.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.200]   And leapfrog we will.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.680]   It is still time, but for that to happen,
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.960]   like I said, we need to know
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.120]   what we just talked about today,
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.440]   because that is not what the mainstream
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.880]   keeps us abreast with.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.800]   When you go to the World Bank,
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.440]   they don't necessarily work along these lines.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:51.280]   They're still, it's not, when you go to universities,
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.560]   I will ask you, MIT, the MIT Econ Department,
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.000]   or even some, most of the professors,
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.240]   are they free market oriented?
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.080]   We find that oftentimes in academia,
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.840]   there is a strong anti-capitalist bias.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.920]   There is a strong anti-free market bias.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.840]   So, this is a problem.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:09.800]   This is a problem.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.840]   - Nobody cares about the economists anyway.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.760]   (Lexi laughs)
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.360]   - So, we move forward.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.880]   - In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.000]   Not in the economics department,
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.920]   because they just write op-ed articles,
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.360]   but in the dreamers, the young undergrads
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.960]   that actually build something.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.840]   - No, I get that, but then we cannot be stifling
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.840]   their efforts by putting these artificially made
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.000]   regulations and laws that stand in the way
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.160]   and clip their wings.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.040]   So, that's why, when you were saying,
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.160]   what advice do you give to them?
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.120]   The advice I give to them is, each one of them,
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.520]   they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.560]   I don't ask anybody to agree with me
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.400]   on face value.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.120]   Go back, do like I had to do.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.600]   I come very much from the left of the left,
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.880]   if you can believe that.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.360]   But I had to have my own intellectual journey.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.240]   And in this case, my intellectual journey
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.080]   was very much complemented by my own life,
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.600]   having to build these companies on two separate continents
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:17.160]   and having to, I had front row seat of the differences.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:20.080]   At first, I thought it was this way just because we're poor
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.680]   and therefore we messed up and therefore it's like this.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.960]   But eventually I learned that, no, we're poor
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.280]   because we lack economic freedom.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.080]   And if a country allows its citizens
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.840]   the economic freedom to enterprise,
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.480]   then they become rich.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.520]   So, I had it upside down, you see.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.400]   And so, it's important for people to know that.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.280]   So, number one, know your facts.
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.720]   Because your facts will empower you.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.560]   In this case, I like to use that word.
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.120]   Facts will empower you and they will even furthermore,
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.640]   they will power you.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:49.280]   Empower and power you.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.760]   'Cause empower is like inside
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.480]   and power is like I push you.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.760]   Forward and up.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.840]   So, that's what it does to know the facts.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.400]   And then, go on and look around you.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.560]   Where are the best practices of this?
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.760]   Who is at the cutting edge of a free market?
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.160]   We're starting a way there.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.440]   People don't necessarily be left behind
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.520]   or anything like that.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.720]   We're in 2022 for Christ's sake.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.240]   We don't have to do entrepreneurship the same way
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.720]   maybe it was done 50 years ago, 100 years ago
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.360]   when as a community, as a people,
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.240]   we were maybe less enlightened because of our times.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.400]   We can update this thing and move forward
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.560]   but update is definitely not build back,
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.400]   what do they call it?
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.160]   Build back new or whatever they're calling it,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.560]   the WF, whatever nonsense and stuff
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.640]   they're smoking over there.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.480]   It's not that.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.720]   There are some principles that are universal
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.880]   and that stand the test of time.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.440]   Those, we have to keep.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.360]   And on top, add the new things we learned
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.440]   from our times and from life.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.560]   So that's what I want them to know.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:54.880]   Learn new facts, be empowered and powered
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.160]   and then look around, think about
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.520]   and look to see where the best practices are
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.560]   around the world because the world is yours.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.720]   You might be African but the world is yours.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.200]   So stop this nonsense of,
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.800]   oh well, it's done by white people
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.120]   so we're not going to do it.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:12.960]   Get the best that exists in humanity
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.120]   for what you're trying to solve.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.520]   And on top of that, put your own twist.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.520]   Bitcoin is all of ours to take.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.200]   Bitcoin is not the white man's thing.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.520]   So therefore, oh, come on,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.240]   because we have a misguided pride.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.080]   We're not going to use Bitcoin
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.400]   because it's white man's stuff.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.000]   Bitcoin is math, you idiot.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.280]   Math is universal so it belongs to all of us.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.240]   - There's no color.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.080]   - Exactly.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.680]   - In the space of economics, in the space of ideas.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:40.720]   - Ideas.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.720]   - And there's a chance to leapfrog too.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.560]   - Exactly.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.880]   - Which is really, really powerful.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.720]   - Exactly.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.680]   Because here we will leapfrog.
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.400]   And Lex, I'm not crazy.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.840]   This is going to happen.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.640]   You mark my words.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.040]   But it's going to happen if as many people
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.840]   hear what we're talking about today.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.280]   Because at some point, the solution is not going to come.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.400]   It's not me.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.800]   It's not, it's going to come from the wisdom of a crowd.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.040]   This is why I love the crowd.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.640]   There's no better wisdom than the crowd
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.680]   and that's also why I believe in the free markets.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.560]   This concept of emergent order.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:15.480]   There's no way, there's no central planning
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.640]   that is smart enough,
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.560]   that has the level of intel that street level people have.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.960]   Trying to create something.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.760]   It's just, we just have to be humble.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.560]   There's just something at the bottom of a pyramid
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.800]   that just bubbles up and happens.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.440]   They're the best.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.680]   - I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.960]   is at the core of a lot of things
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:41.160]   that prevent the flourishing of society.
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.920]   You know, this kind of anecdotally people are like,
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.080]   yeah, everyone's stupid and people say that jokingly.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.680]   But the reality is people are incredible.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.280]   They have the capacity for kindness, for love,
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.640]   for innovation, for brilliance in all kinds of dimensions.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.760]   You might suck at math,
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.200]   but you might be amazing at carpentry.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.640]   You have to find that thing.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.520]   And there's something about
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.440]   when there's freedom to find that thing
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.160]   and people interact, they get excited about shit together
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.120]   and then they build.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.720]   It's, if you look at authoritarian,
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:18.520]   at places that limit that freedom,
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.360]   at the core, I think, is the idea that people are dumb.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.120]   Let us take care of everything.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:26.240]   We'll come up with the rules and the regulations
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.960]   'cause people are too dumb to manage things themselves.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.000]   And then that idea builds on top of itself
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.800]   where you think that the entire populace
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.600]   is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the top.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.200]   Then you add violence on top of that
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.720]   and that leads to corruption,
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:46.360]   to corrupting of just the human mind of the leaders.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.840]   And the whole thing becomes a giant mess.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.560]   The antidote to that is economic freedom.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.480]   - For people to have a freedom to enterprise.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.480]   And look, Lex, when we allow for that to happen,
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.840]   have you looked around lately
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:06.080]   and look at the level of niche
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   that has happened in this country?
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.400]   I mean, you have clubs where,
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.160]   you have places where people are into guitar strings,
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.200]   you know, like some of the,
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.840]   like it's all about guitar strings.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.840]   And others, it's all about these best cupcakes.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.560]   And others, it's all about this new crypto thing over here.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.560]   And others, like hair, best, you know, weight.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:33.560]   When you allow us, because seven billion geniuses,
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.800]   each one of us, I believe, came to this world
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.600]   with something, something that only he or her possesses.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.080]   And that is the genius,
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.360]   and it is their contribution to the human problem.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.440]   - When you think about your identity today,
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.040]   so it all started in Africa,
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.280]   just like it did for the entirety of the human species.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.080]   There's a bit of European flavor in there,
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:00.880]   a little French, Silicon Valley,
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.120]   you're now in part a Texan.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.480]   There's, you really are an American,
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.420]   but you're also an African.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.720]   Who are you when you look in the mirror,
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.480]   when you think about yourself, when you listen,
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.080]   when everything gets quiet and you listen to your heart,
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.440]   who are you?
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.000]   Can you figure out that puzzle?
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.160]   - That's a very interesting question
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:30.160]   because it's been a long time I haven't asked myself.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.360]   I have before.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.520]   (silence)
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:44.680]   What I have found is,
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:52.800]   I think who I am today has been for sure shaped by,
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.320]   I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.400]   Dakar is Senegal, Paris, France,
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.040]   and San Francisco primarily.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.720]   And now, yeah, I think I might wanna ask,
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.680]   there's a little bit of Texan in there.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.280]   - How do you say Texas in French?
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.120]   (laughs)
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:07.960]   - Texas.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.800]   - Texas.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.040]   - Texas.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:10.880]   - So--
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.720]   - Austin, Texas.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:12.560]   - Austin, Texas.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.380]   - Austin.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.220]   - Austin, Texas.
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:15.240]   (laughs)
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.080]   It's easy.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:16.900]   - Not quite as good.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.740]   - Austin, Texas.
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.580]   - Yeah.
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:19.400]   - Yeah.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.240]   - Us, Texas.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.080]   - Us.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.120]   - Us, Texas, yeah.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:22.960]   So,
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:30.280]   I was formed by those three.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:35.280]   I have to say that what I enjoy from my Senegalese roots
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.480]   are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.720]   very much,
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.300]   and Taranga, obviously.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.480]   And I like that it's a culture
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.280]   that's very much about reverence.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.740]   It's, we're big on reverence.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.720]   I don't think you could ever hear me
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.080]   tell an older person, especially not my parents
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.240]   or my grandma or anybody like that,
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.120]   for us to be able to tell an older person,
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.920]   that's not true or you're lying,
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.480]   it would never cross my mind
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.480]   because that's the most disrespectful thing you can think of,
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.760]   the most irreverent thing you can think of.
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.080]   It doesn't mean that you have to agree
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.240]   with everything that's said,
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.880]   but there's a way to disagree.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.440]   There's a way to push back
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.720]   that doesn't have to rob this person
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.920]   who happens to be older than you,
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.680]   especially from the dignity
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.000]   that older age normally provides.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.720]   - And there's wisdom to their words
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:36.320]   that you yourself may not see.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.320]   So the reverence is for the idea of wisdom, of tradition.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.600]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.000]   And again, so that is something that I really enjoy,
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.060]   especially and something I'm very attached to, to this day.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:54.200]   And then from France, what I had to,
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.600]   what I really came to enjoy, of course,
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:00.320]   is all the fineness that one can find
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.120]   within French culture.
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.360]   - The fineness?
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:04.400]   - Yeah, the fineness.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.000]   Foods, the line.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.520]   - You mean like the intricacies,
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.760]   like the very--
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.640]   - Yeah, the sophistication in there.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:14.120]   I mean, French lingerie, for example.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:19.120]   I mean, la dentelle, the laces, all of that, super,
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.560]   it's exquisite.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.560]   So the--
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.640]   - Fashion, the food.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.040]   - Fashion, the food.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.520]   I mean, there's something to be said about all of that,
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.480]   and it's very beautiful.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.680]   And I love also, even when I talk about fineness,
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.760]   it's like a meal is not about like this big thing
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.040]   they put in front of you,
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.200]   but smaller portions, enjoy what you're eating
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.240]   and spend time at the table.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.400]   Like the eating time is not necessarily
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.280]   just this function of feeding yourself,
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:46.480]   which I understand it,
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.560]   but for, this is something that they share
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.560]   with Senegalese culture,
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.200]   is eating is a moment of communion.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.960]   It's a moment of friendship, family.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.560]   It's a precious moment.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.800]   To this day, and my husband is American,
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:06.600]   we eat our meals together all the time.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.120]   There's, I would not have it any other way.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.120]   And there's a prep time, all of that stuff.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.840]   It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.040]   - Actually, to push back a little bit, it's interesting,
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.280]   'cause yeah, the camaraderie over a meal
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.160]   is a beautiful thing.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.960]   I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.440]   'cause on the way to Ukraine, I traveled to Paris.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.440]   I stayed in Paris and I wasn't able to enjoy the fineness
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:35.040]   because it was almost a distraction from the humanity
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:36.360]   for some reason to me,
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.160]   because there's such a focus on the art of it all
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:42.560]   that you lose the basic connection to humanity.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.240]   Now, that said--
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240]   - Depends what you're talking about.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:48.720]   - I think some of the lack of connection over humanity
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.720]   was the fact that while I did know how to speak French
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.400]   for a long time, I forgot most of the language.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.120]   And so part of it, there is a barrier.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.600]   You said hospitality.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.360]   There is a bit of a barrier in French culture
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.960]   to where in order to be welcomed in,
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.400]   you have to hear the music
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.200]   and be able to play the music of the people.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:16.440]   And if you don't, there's a bit of a barrier.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.000]   - I must admit on that and that it is true.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.040]   You would feel less that if you were
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.120]   with a group of Senegalese people per se,
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.520]   or I would even say if a group of Spanish people.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.720]   And I think this is maybe the other side of it
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.640]   for the French people.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.200]   They can be a little bit uppity up there.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:38.360]   And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there.
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:40.320]   If you don't have the codes,
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.920]   which is what you call the, you don't sing the music,
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.440]   then it's hard for you to be part of it.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.640]   But I was speaking here from the standpoint of you're in.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.080]   - Yeah, from the inside.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.800]   Also, come on, come on.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.960]   Coming from Texas and also Ukraine,
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.560]   Ukraine, I should say some of the best steak and meat
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.640]   I've ever had, cheap.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:03.120]   Texas, some of the greatest.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.000]   The size of the meals in France,
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.720]   it's like, what are we doing here?
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.880]   I get it's art.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:14.600]   I like to look at my art on the wall
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.720]   and then eat my damn steak.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:17.560]   - Did you go?
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.000]   So maybe, okay, no, no, no, no.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.320]   Okay, now here I have to defend them
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:22.080]   although sometimes I'm the worst.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.440]   No, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant?
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.280]   Maybe that's why.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.120]   - Yeah, a little bit.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:27.960]   - That's why.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:28.800]   - A little bit.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.640]   - Because next time you go to France,
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.640]   I'll take you to the countryside or any French home.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.040]   They will serve you multiple times.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:41.240]   I mean, by the time you're done,
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:43.200]   even if it's, the portions are smaller.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.040]   They're smaller if you want to,
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.000]   but because that way you get a chance to really
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.640]   feel what you're eating and then have more
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.480]   and then all of that stuff,
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.640]   but not be like, ah, like this.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.920]   And then, but no, you'll eat plenty,
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.000]   but it's because you went to the Michelin places
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:55.840]   where they're like.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.800]   - I'm sure the warmth of the people is there.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.600]   It almost makes me sad that sometimes,
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.000]   I think to properly be in a place,
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.800]   you really should spend a long time there.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.640]   - Yeah, a long time.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.640]   - And also be emotionally ready.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.360]   Again, I was emotionally unavailable.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.200]   I was just like.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.440]   - Well, I would imagine on your way to the Ukraine,
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.200]   I'm like, who can think about food?
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.240]   - But in your identity, a bit of Texas,
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.880]   a bit of San Francisco.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.560]   - Yeah, San Francisco.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.680]   And I guess from America,
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:28.040]   the defining thing for me for America is,
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.040]   it's the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.880]   See, very quickly, when I moved from France
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.040]   to the United States and I started becoming successful
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.520]   in the United States, I found myself,
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.280]   me and my husband, he was French
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.880]   and my first husband, who passed away.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.200]   We found ourselves at some point,
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:50.520]   we stopped talking to our friends in France
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.280]   who stayed in France,
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.840]   because we were talking to them about things
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:00.360]   that were so outside of their comprehension.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:04.280]   What do you mean you're in your 20s
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.280]   and you just raised, I don't know,
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.680]   a million dollars or $2 million,
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:11.840]   especially from back in those days.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.520]   Today, it's easy here and there.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.560]   - So even in France, that entrepreneurial spirit
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.800]   didn't burn quite as bright.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.560]   - I mean, don't take me wrong.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.520]   Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France?
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.880]   Yeah, but to the level that you have it in the US?
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.000]   Absolutely not.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.120]   It's just, I mean, in France, it's still very much,
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.040]   you're born in this area, you go to school in that area,
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.840]   your parents live around, eventually you'll marry
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.080]   and be where your parents are,
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:38.280]   or maybe go to where your spouse's parents are,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.720]   and you buy your house and you buy it once
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.640]   and you're not going to do like the Americans,
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.760]   two years later, I sell my house, I go somewhere else.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.800]   You don't have any of, what do you mean,
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.960]   like just stopping from nowhere,
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:51.000]   you're going to do what, start a business
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.400]   and you have nothing to back you up or whatever?
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.760]   Oh, and even this idea of going and fundraising,
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.720]   this venture cap, especially back in the days,
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.040]   venture cap, all of that, it's very American.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.560]   We take it for granted, but it's very American.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.440]   Who would have made a bet on me in France?
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.640]   The same person.
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.480]   I would not have found the same people.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:13.400]   I would never in France have been able to raise,
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.040]   at some point it was $32 million for my first business,
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.400]   never would have been able to do that in France.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.920]   And it doesn't mean that French people are bad people
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.760]   or anything like that.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.560]   It's just something that's just not so in the culture.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.120]   Just like this whole concept of philanthropy,
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.200]   it's not that the French people don't do philanthropy,
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.680]   but philanthropy in America is very different
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.280]   from the level and also the magnitude
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.920]   of maybe what the French people do.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.960]   And also they have this, always like,
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.640]   oh, let's do it behind the scene.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.440]   Money is suspicious, success is suspicious.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.480]   So at some point my husband and I just felt like
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:46.000]   our friends actually were maybe thinking
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.840]   that we're maybe some drug dealers or something.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.000]   So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000]   And so, yes, in America, I found this entrepreneurial spirit,
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.680]   but then I was able to link it with something
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.840]   that I'm very familiar with in my country.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.920]   See, back home in Senegal, I'm part of this,
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.680]   you have what we call the Mouride, I'm a Mouride.
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.800]   So what it is, is one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal,
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.040]   Mouridism is the most influential of them
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.320]   and the biggest one.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.560]   And us, it's all about entrepreneurship as well.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.800]   I mean, of course there's a whole religious part,
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.240]   but our mantra is pray as if you will die tomorrow
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.480]   and work as if you will never die.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.360]   And the way we say, the way somebody will say
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.280]   that somebody passed away, we say, somebody has retired.
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:39.640]   Somebody has retired from their work, right?
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.760]   - Beautiful. - Right?
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:45.760]   So I think it's funny because in that community,
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.880]   we're very much entrepreneurial,
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.440]   left to our own devices, we're entrepreneurial.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.480]   But then what happens is the minute people start going to,
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:58.000]   they're being educated through the education system,
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.880]   like the French, especially the system,
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:03.360]   but tend to breed more like over French bureaucrat mindset,
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.560]   then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.920]   kind of starting to dwindle down.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.440]   So it's kind of very interesting.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:13.040]   So in a way, America helped me reunite
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.240]   with that side of my roots,
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:20.240]   where America tells me, reinforces that side of my roots
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.920]   and also gives me more tools to practice
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:25.800]   that side of my roots, if that makes any sense.
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.240]   - Through all of that,
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.160]   that's what brings out the heart of a cheetah,
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.320]   which I think is a beautiful, beautiful thing
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.560]   that encapsulate that whole trajectory,
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.800]   which I think is the best possible answer
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.760]   anyone could give.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.160]   It makes me want to really think about who I am,
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.080]   because you really have brought together
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:49.240]   so many cultures within yourself.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.160]   Like just talking to you makes you feel like
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.240]   we are just all one people.
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.600]   - Because at the end, we are, at the end we are.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:01.320]   And when you come from, at the end we are,
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.400]   and also I think for me,
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.480]   if people can take anything from my story,
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.640]   it's at the end of the day, I am very clear about it.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.240]   And I'm all for harmony among people
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.800]   and among us peoples.
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:20.000]   If we can accept that we're all,
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.280]   I know this sounds so cliche, but for me, it's so true,
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.800]   that we're all humans.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.600]   You know, when I left Senegal,
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.040]   when I was about to leave Senegal for the first time
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:33.360]   and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents,
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.480]   because now they had emigrated
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.480]   and things were going to be fine
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:40.880]   and I was going to be, things were stable for them.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.760]   Now they're like, it's time to be reunited with her.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.280]   They brought me over, but before I left Senegal,
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.760]   my grandma sat me down.
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:50.160]   She, actually, she lowered herself down to my level
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.000]   and she said, "Magat, you're about to go to this place
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.120]   where most people will not look like you."
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:59.920]   And most people speak a language
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.200]   that's going to be different from yours.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:03.600]   And you're going to realize that all the kids
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.720]   are going to school and you've never been to school
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.640]   because, you know, I was, like I said, a free-range kid
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.680]   and I was just living my life.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:13.720]   And she said, "But I don't want for any of that,"
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:14.800]   and she showed her words, she said,
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.480]   "I don't want for any of that to intimidate you."
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.360]   She said, "You can be impressed by some of it if you want,
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.320]   but no intimidation."
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.760]   And she said, "Because the fact that they might be different
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.560]   from you, yeah, they're going to have a different skin color
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:30.960]   from you, but it is still human skin.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.880]   You're human, they're human."
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:35.320]   And she said, "This language you're going to speak,
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.440]   it's a different language from yours,
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:41.080]   but it is still a language that humans speak.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:44.720]   You're human, they're human, therefore you can speak it."
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.560]   And lastly, they have gone to school.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.680]   Going to school is what little humans do.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:52.800]   You're a little human, so you'll be just fine.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.160]   And I went and grandma was right, right?
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.600]   It was right!
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.580]   And that helped me.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:03.280]   And I think when you internalize that so early on,
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.280]   it just makes you belong to the human family
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:08.280]   that you're part of.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:10.280]   I am part of a human family.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.920]   And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.240]   Let's take...
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.340]   And be totally open.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.660]   - Maybe don't go right now, but.
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:18.500]   - No, not now.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.340]   Maybe not now, you're right.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:21.860]   - Or at least don't bring weed if you go.
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:23.380]   Go on the plane when you go.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:25.600]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.080]   Right, that girl, I don't know what she was thinking.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.960]   But no, so, but what I'm trying to say, Lex,
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.320]   is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world,
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.440]   including some of the most unfriendly places in the world
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.500]   to someone like me, because there are places like that.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:46.500]   And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere,
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.880]   someone will take care of me.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.480]   Someone will help me.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.180]   When I first came to this country,
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:56.380]   I came as a tourist.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:56:02.360]   But you had this amazing family who had a business,
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.000]   a family business in Indiana, Columbus, Indiana.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.720]   The Wentzes, Carol and Eldon Wentz,
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.720]   I owe them everything that I have in this country,
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.420]   that I am in this country.
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:17.420]   They are Americans in mid-America
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:19.360]   from a place that most other Americans
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.040]   would maybe look down on, because, you know.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:22.880]   And some people would be like,
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:23.720]   "Oh, you're going to this place
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.280]   where they have more churches and cows than people."
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.040]   You know, that type of behavior,
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.880]   because, you know, the coastal elites.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.240]   But it is in Midwest, in the Midwest,
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:39.120]   that I found that I, a black, young woman,
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.160]   coming out of nowhere, found support.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.600]   They all rallied around me.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.480]   I didn't even come from the same faith as they are from.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.920]   Yet their whole church rallied around me
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.640]   to find me an apartment.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:55.600]   My host family found me, got me a job,
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:57.600]   and it was not a petty job.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:00.080]   They were like, "We need, we are in serious needs
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.320]   of getting our accounting under control,
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.520]   and our marketing and all of that."
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:05.800]   And I had to catch up years of accounting,
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:10.000]   like 2%, and come up with marketing, all of that.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.720]   And I did it way faster than they thought
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.160]   I would ever be able to do that.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.440]   At some point, they look at me and they're like,
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:17.360]   "Look, there is a future for you.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.840]   And we are too small for that future.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.360]   And now we could be selfish
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:23.280]   and keep you here with us.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.600]   And we would want nothing more than that."
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   Because really, they're like my parents to this day.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.240]   I just came back from seeing them.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.360]   And they said, "But there's so much more for you.
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.720]   And we don't have it.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.240]   So we want you to go and find out what it is."
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.040]   And that's eventually when I, you know,
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:41.280]   because something was brewing up in San Francisco
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.580]   when I say I left my heart in San Francisco.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:47.440]   Because, you know, the man who would become my husband,
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.880]   we went to the same business school in France,
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.240]   but then he was older than me.
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:51.960]   So he had come to San Francisco
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.440]   and started a business there.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:55.160]   And it just looked like there was something there.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.280]   And Scarol was like, "You got to go to San Francisco
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.200]   and find out with Emmanuel what's going on."
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:00.560]   So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.480]   I came back and I'm like, "Okay, I'm leaving.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.720]   Here's the keys to my apartment."
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:04.880]   Well, I don't know, I'm just kidding.
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:06.640]   But I'm like, "I'm out of here."
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:08.920]   So no, but, Scarol, so this is it.
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:11.160]   This is what I'm saying, especially in these times
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:14.800]   when this country loves to dwell on, you know,
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.600]   you're bad because you have this skin color.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.520]   Here are people with a completely different skin color
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.800]   than mine, completely different faith than mine,
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:25.800]   yet embraced me, protected me, paid for my visa,
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.360]   you know, for my lawyer, for my H-1B, everything,
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:34.160]   and also played emotional support for me.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:37.080]   And no one, no one asked them to do that.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:38.480]   They didn't have to do it.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.320]   They didn't.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.200]   So what I'm saying is,
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.240]   and this has been the story of my life.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.560]   Everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me,
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:50.080]   you betcha that there's always, always going to be somebody
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:54.040]   who shows up for you, and somebody who is at the extremes,
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.800]   at the antipodes of where you are and who you are.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.200]   And that tells me something.
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:01.000]   In the end, we are good people.
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.640]   Most people are good people.
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:04.560]   - And there's so much power to that,
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:10.480]   the internalizing of this idea that we're all just human,
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:13.080]   and there's human kindness all around us.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:17.800]   I've seen it a lot where people internalize that,
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:22.040]   and they're able to walk lightly amidst hate.
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:22.880]   - Yeah.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.360]   - And walk past it.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:25.200]   - Yes.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.560]   - And it doesn't stick to them in a way
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:33.080]   that they build resentment, and it paralyzes them.
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.960]   If they internalize the world as human,
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.880]   they can be in the, just like you said,
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:40.640]   in the worst places in the world for them.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.520]   - And someone, somewhere,
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.440]   that human magic and touch is there.
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.840]   - Yeah, it will find them.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.480]   It will find, yeah, yeah.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.920]   And you know, the other thing too, Lex,
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:53.080]   is especially in these times we're walking in,
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.640]   it is to remind yourself.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.320]   I think this is where we all are called
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:01.280]   to practice more courage.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.280]   I call it courage.
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:07.120]   It's the courage to show up with curiosity,
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.320]   with empathy, and with love.
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.720]   To me, those three are the antidote
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:13.480]   to pretty much anything.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:14.760]   Curiosity and being in love.
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:19.680]   In the face of fear, can you show up with curiosity?
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.920]   In the face of hate, can you say,
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:26.600]   I'm gonna engage with love, even if I'm scared to death,
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:29.360]   and even if I'm pissed off to death by this?
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.680]   But can you do that?
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:35.040]   In the face of just like, you know, judgment or whatever,
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:36.800]   can you show up with empathy?
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:40.920]   And I had just found that when you try to do that,
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:44.080]   you engage very different parts of your brain.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.560]   That's proven, by the way, by a brain scientist.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.840]   But you also can feel it in your body
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:51.400]   that you're engaging very different parts of your soul.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.960]   And so I try myself, I'm not always good at it,
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.680]   but it's a practice that I try to honor,
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.680]   which is curiosity, empathy, and love.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.120]   - As I told you offline,
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.600]   I agree with you 100% on that.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.880]   But there is, you know, when you go to Ukraine,
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:12.480]   and you can speak about the power of love,
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:16.240]   but when you lose your family, when you lose your home,
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:18.040]   all you have in your heart is hate.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.480]   Even if you know it, you're not supposed to have it.
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:22.880]   You still, all you have is hate.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.880]   So sometimes it's a very human thing
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.440]   to have resentment, to have hate.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.760]   - But it is about trying not to stay there.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:36.400]   And it's okay if it takes you years.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:40.280]   But it is about trying, and I mean the word trying.
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.760]   It is about trying not to stay there.
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:45.720]   - Let me ask you about some of the things
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.680]   you see in this country from your perspective
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:50.600]   of everywhere you've been in the world.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.800]   What do you think about the Black Lives Matter movement
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.240]   here in America that does struggle
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:03.560]   with the role of skin color today,
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:07.760]   and throughout the history of this country,
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.360]   and maybe even throughout the history of the world?
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:16.360]   - Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me.
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.360]   Because do Black Lives Matter,
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.200]   those three words together in that order,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.280]   what they mean, they mean everything.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.520]   Because Black Lives do matter,
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.640]   as any other lives do matter.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.960]   But I know in this case why they say Black Lives Matter,
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.720]   because some of the context we have had.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.280]   Now, while I agree with the principles
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:39.440]   that Black Lives Matter, I have a big problem
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.120]   with the organization and what it stands for.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.680]   When I have an organization that pretends
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.320]   to want to stand for Black Lives to matter,
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:56.320]   yet you are self-proclaimed Marxist socialists,
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.680]   I pause.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:01.720]   Why?
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.280]   I pause and then I'm like, have we learned nothing?
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:07.960]   Have we learned nothing?
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:10.080]   And the reason why I say that, Lex,
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.600]   is because 60 some years ago,
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:18.440]   it started before even 60 some years ago,
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:24.920]   Black people in this case,
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:27.240]   I'm talking about the African people,
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:32.840]   I'm talking about the Black Africans
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.840]   who would go on to really cement this concept
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:43.320]   of African emancipation and African liberation.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.080]   And here I'm taking us back to 1945.
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.280]   They had four of them before that.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:53.400]   But in 1945, in Manchester, UK,
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.480]   happened something that would become major
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.480]   for Africa and its future, especially sub-Saharan Africa.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:07.480]   In Manchester, UK, people like Blaise Diagne of my country,
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:14.280]   Nyerere, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana,
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:19.520]   and others and others from different parts of the continent
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.520]   got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:28.280]   And I say Dubois because that's how we say it in French.
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:29.280]   He has a French name.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:31.280]   French name at least.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:34.080]   And Americans would say, so for Americans listening,
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.760]   I know you say Dubois.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.120]   - Oh boy. - But Dubois.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:37.960]   No, because just in case,
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.320]   they're like, "Who is he talking about?"
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.720]   That's who I'm talking about.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:44.600]   So all of those people got together in the UK
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:50.360]   and with W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey,
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.960]   big top African-American intellectuals of their times.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:58.760]   W.E.B. Dubois had so many things happen to him,
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.360]   starting from the North,
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.440]   being more or less a liberal type guy,
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:08.280]   came to the South just to see at this time,
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:09.680]   black people being lynched
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.840]   and some of their body parts being shown in store windows.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:18.000]   I mean, just for a second, we put ourselves in his shoes.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.400]   I put myself in his shoes.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.080]   And that's when he started to become radicalized.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.800]   Because at first it was like, "Oh, reforms."
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.960]   And I was like, "God darn it, these people,
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:28.640]   "we don't talk to them, we force."
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:33.200]   And eventually, little by little, things going through.
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.560]   Yeah, you have these people,
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.960]   they're very much on the Marxist-Socialist train.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:43.000]   - So do you think the sort of,
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.320]   it's the political movements that are just using-
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:49.320]   - Yeah, because what happened back in those days,
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:52.760]   it is true that to their credit,
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:57.360]   the communist-socialists were fighting for equal rights.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:59.360]   They were fighting for the rights of black people
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.200]   to have equal rights.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:05.600]   So of course, I could see why one could say,
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:07.440]   especially in those times,
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.200]   you're being lynched, body's burnt,
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:18.200]   body parts showcased at window stores.
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:26.120]   Meanwhile, in Africa, under colonization,
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:31.120]   in your own country, in your own land.
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:38.280]   And you have this group that's saying,
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:44.520]   your fight is part of what we fight.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:50.200]   Of course, you're gonna say, "I side with you."
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:53.320]   Especially if this is all happening at a time
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:07:00.240]   where, so 1945, these guys who would be
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:03.440]   the liberators of various African nations,
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:07.800]   they're meeting with Garvey, with W.E.B. Dubois.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:11.880]   And that's where, this meeting is very important.
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.000]   It's the fifth Pan-African Congress meeting.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.160]   It's very important.
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.080]   It could be their last one,
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:17.800]   but it's the most important one
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.560]   because that's when they formed their plans
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:22.400]   and really rallied around this concept
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:26.520]   of African emancipation and African liberation.
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.320]   We're gonna liberate our countries.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:31.880]   Then later, so that's how all of these movements
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:33.160]   started to happen.
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:36.120]   And from there, Gandhi was already making some progress
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:40.000]   with India, getting them out of British rule and all of that.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.080]   So all of this was happening
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:42.800]   and really this whole thing was bubbling,
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.120]   bubbling, bubbling.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:46.560]   There's a new force going on.
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:49.000]   And then we arrived in the late '50s
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.640]   and Krumah with them, with the British as well,
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:56.160]   they might manage to become,
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:08:00.040]   their colonization is over.
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.400]   They were the first one to go in, '57.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:05.040]   Then from there, it's what we call the independences.
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.120]   That's what most sub-Saharan African nations
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:08.040]   are getting their independences.
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:11.360]   Different dates, mine, April 4th, 1960.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:13.560]   So all over, so this is happening.
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.400]   And now think about it.
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.000]   You're talking '57, you're talking '60.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.720]   We're like at this time now with the middle of a Cold War.
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:23.080]   'Cause we have to put things in context
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:24.680]   if we wanna understand what's going on.
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:27.040]   Because people today ask me, "Why do you think?"
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.360]   Because even now when they understand,
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:30.480]   "Oh, you're right, it makes sense.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.920]   "If you have no economic freedom, you're gonna be poor."
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.760]   But why?
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:34.880]   Why did they go for this?
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:35.720]   Why did they go for this?
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:36.920]   And then they don't understand.
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:37.800]   So that's what happened.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:41.880]   So beginning of times, pre-colonial Africans
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.240]   were free marketeers, free enterprise.
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:47.120]   It's pretty well recorded by someone like George Aite.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.240]   That's where I got the Chile thing from.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:50.640]   And Ghanaian economist.
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.880]   And then slavery happened, colonialism happened,
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:54.720]   and then the independences.
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:58.840]   Late '50s, early '60s for most sub-Saharan African countries.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.680]   So there, what you have is, but then what happened there?
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:06.200]   So I told you in '45, fifth Pan-African Congress in the UK
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:08.520]   with the liberators of Africa.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:14.720]   Under the leadership, because he was the wise,
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:17.120]   eldest man, Dubois was.
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.480]   He was in his 70s back in the day.
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:19.880]   So he's older than them,
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.120]   and he's coming with all of his ideas and everything.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:23.200]   So we're like, "Ooh."
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:24.440]   So there they are.
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.160]   Now we're in the late '50s, early '60s.
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:28.880]   We're starting to make progress with the independences.
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.320]   India has gone there before.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.160]   So all of that is starting to happen.
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:35.800]   And at that time, remember,
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.240]   they already were being introduced
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:40.880]   to the concept of socialism, Marxism,
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.040]   all of that way before by some of these
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:48.600]   Black African-American intellectuals of their time
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:51.760]   who were very socialist Marxist by that time.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.640]   So now they're becoming independent
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:57.160]   because I do independent like this
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:01.200]   because I reckon that there's still neo-colonism going on.
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:04.560]   So now this is happening, we're becoming free.
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:06.720]   But then you look around, what do you see?
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.040]   That now most of these liberators of their nations
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:12.920]   become the president of their nations.
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.280]   But remember what I told you?
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:17.720]   Most of them have drunken
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.280]   the Marxist socialism Kool-Aid.
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:25.960]   So as these African nations become independent
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:30.960]   with their first independent governments and presidents,
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:35.080]   most of them are socialists,
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.760]   various forms of statist type of government.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.680]   And this is because at that point,
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:45.280]   we had made a fatal mistake of saying,
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:48.720]   we are Marxist socialist
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.160]   because you guys fight for equal rights.
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.000]   So in this case,
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.680]   there should be no colonialism or anything like that.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:57.920]   So not only you have that going on,
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.560]   and the people, so right now,
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.960]   you had this battle of ideology going on
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:04.760]   because on one end represented by freedom
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.000]   and the economic, what do you call it?
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.320]   The economic system they were using is capitalism.
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:12.080]   And these are represented by the Western nations
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:14.240]   facing off with Eastern bloc,
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:16.200]   practicing various forms of statism,
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:19.000]   socialism, communism, various forms of statism.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.400]   And these two are fighting for influence.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.160]   So, and we also have, it's also not, so two things there.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.280]   One is we're at a time where,
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.840]   remember the free market concept was almost dead.
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.840]   Almost dead.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:38.240]   So almost every intellectual at that time was social Marxist
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:42.280]   or Marxist socialist, I put the name.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:43.240]   That's what you were.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:46.040]   So you're in a world where it was a normal thing.
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:48.840]   It was just mainstream acceptance.
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:50.640]   So not only you have that force,
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:52.360]   but at the same time,
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:54.200]   if these two forces are fighting one another,
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.800]   it turns out that the one representing capitalism
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:00.000]   and freedom, well, sorry,
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.800]   but isn't it you who enslaved us and colonized us?
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:07.320]   And you're fighting with the people who represent,
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:10.360]   supposedly people who are saying that,
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:12.200]   who had been fighting for equal rights for us,
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.920]   with us for the longest time.
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:15.760]   These are our friends.
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:17.800]   And that's when we made a fatal mistake.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.840]   Because while yes, there were maybe good things
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.440]   to agree on with Marxist socialist of the times,
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:28.680]   especially equal rights for all people and all of that,
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:29.960]   that's the only thing we should have,
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:32.080]   among the only things we should have agreed upon.
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:35.640]   There are violent revolution tendencies, no way.
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:39.480]   When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:41.880]   We should not have thrown the baby out with the bathwater,
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:43.040]   but that's what we did.
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.360]   And that's when we made a fatal mistake.
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:47.440]   So then we became free, all of these nations,
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:50.360]   and most of them started with socialist
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:52.640]   or communist leaders.
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:54.800]   My country, socialist.
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:58.920]   Leopold Sedar Senghor, he was a socialist.
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:01.720]   And they stayed in power for 40 years.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.080]   The first 40 years of our freedom years.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:08.240]   And all over the continent, more or less,
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:09.880]   that's what you had.
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.320]   And on top of that, something else that the French don't know
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.560]   that people don't know is France with its colonies said,
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:21.560]   "You cannot not do, you have to keep the French civil law."
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:30.080]   So we're talking about the Napoleonic civil code.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.600]   Are you kidding me?
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:32.800]   So that's what happened.
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:37.800]   So the reason why I go back to BLM is while I have
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.680]   all the respect in the world
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.640]   and all the compassion in the world
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.960]   for people like Ruma, for people like Nyerere,
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:48.880]   for people, all of those people of those times,
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.600]   the liberators of Africa,
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.040]   while I have so much love, compassion for them,
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:57.560]   I am also able to say,
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.000]   because I got the benefit of 60 some years time
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.080]   and where you get to do a debrief
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.880]   and see what worked, what didn't work, what happened.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.680]   We have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:18.040]   So yes, I can understand why they did what they did.
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:21.120]   I can even, I can understand why they sided
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.440]   with these people who on the surface,
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:26.200]   or at least some part of a fight was the same fight as them
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:27.680]   when it came to equal rights.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:31.360]   I can excuse them,
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:37.960]   but I will not excuse the BLM founders
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:43.680]   because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago.
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:45.960]   Today, no.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:50.960]   The blacks of today cannot be serious
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:55.040]   about black lives mattering and saying in the same sentence
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:58.480]   and we're gonna be socialist Marx, Marxist socialist.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.840]   It just doesn't work.
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:03.520]   - So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:06.280]   with the ideas of Marxism. - With those ideologies.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:10.920]   Yeah, they're anti-free market, anti-capitalist.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:15.520]   And we do know that you have to have free markets
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:17.360]   in order to build prosperity.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:21.880]   And prosperity means economic power.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:26.520]   If you have economic power, no one messes with you.
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:27.440]   Or if they're gonna do it,
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:28.360]   they're gonna have to think twice.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:31.200]   And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.360]   So if you want for blacks to be respected
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.200]   anywhere in the world,
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.960]   you're gonna have to be serious about black prosperity.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.200]   En masse, not just a few people,
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:44.880]   Oprah over here and somebody over there, no.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:49.880]   We as a group have to be a critical mass of prosperity
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.560]   across the board.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:55.360]   And because we're talking critical mass of prosperity
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.600]   across the board,
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:59.800]   it means black people everywhere in the world.
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:00.880]   But guess what?
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:03.840]   We in Africa happen to represent 90%
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:06.120]   of our representatives of a black race.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:08.960]   So you're gonna be serious about black lives mattering
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:11.400]   without being serious for Africa,
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:14.040]   the 1 billion people in Africa that are black
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:16.320]   and for them to have access to the free markets
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:18.160]   and yes, fossil fuels,
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:23.200]   so that they can rocket up prosperity wise.
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.680]   - And the resources of the young people, the young minds.
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:29.040]   - So that all of these young people,
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:32.400]   young minds can finally manifest their greatness
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:33.720]   that I know they have.
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:35.280]   And that they're showing you us every day
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:37.760]   despite the obstacles.
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.120]   That's what we need.
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:42.680]   Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:44.200]   and will be richer than France.
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.760]   The colonizer, Singapore did it, we can do it.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.800]   Mali rich, Nigeria rich, functioning as well.
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:57.680]   Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich, Zimbabwe rich,
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:02.120]   Niger rich, everywhere rich, prosperous.
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:06.120]   As prosperous if not more prosperous than Switzerland
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:10.360]   or Singapore or the US or the Lichtenstein or Luxembourg,
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:15.360]   places that have no natural resources.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.120]   We become rich and you watch the world
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:22.480]   having a very different relationship with us.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:27.240]   That's the only time we will command any type of respect.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:29.920]   That's when people, even the,
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:34.680]   our common psyche will change even about black people.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:37.320]   All of the stereotypes that they have of us
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.080]   is gonna melt away.
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:43.080]   And you may still not like us,
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:44.640]   but you will still respect us
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:47.800]   because we are a force to be dealt with.
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.160]   And only economic power does that.
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.760]   It would be nice, of course,
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:55.400]   for us to respect people because they're people.
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.600]   It would be nice, but let us not kid ourselves.
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.800]   This is earth.
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:04.080]   And someone said, "Nice people will make it to heaven,
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:05.920]   "but not to Harvard necessarily."
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:06.760]   It's true.
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:11.760]   - It's interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect.
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:14.680]   It would be nice if it did.
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:17.040]   - It would be nice, but it doesn't.
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.240]   - Prosperity is the only thing.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.520]   - Prosperity is the only thing.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.880]   And the way we do that, there is no,
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.880]   just like all of us humans have to inhale oxygen
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:31.040]   and exhale carbon dioxide.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.240]   That's a human way of breathing.
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.600]   You bring me on, but you wanna be foolish
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:37.360]   and be like, "Oh, well, sorry.
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:38.560]   "That's how white people breathe.
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:40.040]   "So as black people, we're gonna have
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:40.880]   "to do something different."
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.480]   Well, good luck with that.
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.320]   Right? - Yeah.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.880]   - So this is here why I'm saying,
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:47.080]   I have no patience for Black Lives Matter.
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:49.800]   They're making a mistake that was made
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.960]   60 some plus years ago, even more than that,
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.320]   maybe even a hundred years,
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:58.320]   when we were siding with the Marxist-Socialists
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.360]   because they're the ones who've been fighting
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:01.440]   for equal rights.
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:07.480]   - Let me ask you though about racism.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.000]   Do you, as you travel through this world,
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:16.000]   as you travel through America, feel the burn of hatred?
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.160]   You've spoken about the revolutions that have been fought
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:25.760]   throughout the 20th century against racism.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.280]   But today, as people talk about educating,
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:31.480]   reminding the world with the,
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:33.320]   even with more philosophical ideas
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.760]   of critical race theory, for example,
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:38.000]   do you think this is still a battle
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.320]   that needs to be fought at the forefront of culture
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:43.640]   in the United States?
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:49.800]   - Does racism exist?
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:50.720]   Yes, it does.
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:55.280]   But all forms of isms exist.
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:59.040]   Some people, it's about various forms of ableism.
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:02.720]   Others, it's about size.
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:06.560]   And racism, yes, is one of them.
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:08.240]   Does it exist? Yes, it does.
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:12.400]   But is it what's gonna stop anyone
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.520]   from manifesting their greatest potential?
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:17.200]   I say no.
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:18.440]   I say no.
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:21.480]   Many people in this country have showed it.
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:26.120]   Whether they're African-Americans or African-immigrant,
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:27.360]   I'm an African-immigrant.
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:30.920]   You have African-Americans like Oprah and others,
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:32.720]   and other people even before her,
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.440]   who, despite the nastiness around them,
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:38.680]   were able to make it.
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:43.640]   So we do know, especially us Black people,
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:46.160]   but I think it's humanity as a whole.
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.480]   And that's what I love about the human spirit.
[02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:50.640]   It's resiliency.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:52.240]   But resiliency only can happen
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:55.080]   if you don't allow yourself to be beaten down
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:58.680]   and to lose yourself of agency.
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:03.040]   It's, of course, easier said than done.
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:07.680]   And some among us need a little bit more help
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:10.440]   to not succumb for it than others do.
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:13.000]   And I've seen it.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.320]   It might be harder for you if you're somewhere
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:20.320]   in a city, you know, in a city, Black America.
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:24.720]   Maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:26.160]   for you to try and get your act together
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:27.720]   and all of that stuff.
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:29.600]   And it's okay.
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:32.200]   But even in that situation,
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:36.120]   we need to, I think it's important
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:39.280]   that we still do not rob you of your agency.
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:44.240]   And this is where I am mad as heck
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.480]   against those who supposedly care
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:52.160]   and their idea of how to make sure
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:55.240]   that I don't become or stay a victim of racism
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:57.200]   is through all the things we talked about,
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:01.920]   the CRT, the anti-racism crap of, you know,
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:06.320]   Abraham X. Kendi and what's her name?
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:07.520]   Robin DiAngelo.
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.520]   I mean, her, I'm shocked.
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.160]   The woman is making all of this money,
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:15.600]   supposedly fighting a war on our behalf.
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:18.080]   I'm like, "Lady, I hear you loud and clear
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.440]   "that you are a true racist.
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.720]   "I know, but you told me you are."
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:23.320]   And for you to think that your anti-racism
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:26.600]   makes you less racist, and that happens too.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.760]   She comes from a racist background.
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:30.960]   Fine, she's saying it, it's true.
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:35.840]   But this idea that every walking person on earth
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.280]   belongs to one category or the other,
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:39.800]   depending on which skin color you came with,
[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:43.920]   it's problematic at its root.
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:47.520]   So my point is, does racism exist?
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:48.360]   Yes.
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.440]   Do you think it's gonna stop me
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.120]   from doing anything I have to do?
[02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:53.240]   No.
[02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:55.920]   Might it make it harder, longer?
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:58.640]   Maybe, but it will not stop me.
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:02.120]   But for it not to stop me,
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:04.560]   I can't engage in victimhood mentality.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:06.120]   I can't lose myself.
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:09.720]   I gotta use all the agency that I have
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:13.040]   to fight back and fight beyond, see?
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.600]   It's just a bit of fight back.
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:15.920]   You fight back and you fight beyond.
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:18.600]   'Cause at some point, yeah, and.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:20.120]   It's this concept of yes, and.
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:24.360]   So this is why I have loved the job.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:26.400]   So when I have somebody who is like,
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:28.640]   "Oh, anti-racism is the way.
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:31.280]   "Are we gonna go and tell all the white kids
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.960]   "that because they happen to be white
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:35.600]   "that they're really the oppressors and blah, blah, blah,
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:37.800]   "and the black kids because they're black?"
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:41.560]   You're not changing anything when you're doing that.
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:44.040]   Nothing except that you're putting problems
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:46.400]   where there were no problems to start with.
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:48.240]   All we had to do was maybe
[02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:50.120]   go for a different route from there.
[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:51.320]   Kids are kids.
[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:52.560]   Kids are born kids.
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:54.320]   And this, I'm not sure if you wanna get me
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:57.680]   going on to the whole science of bias,
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:00.040]   because that's something I spent years of my life on.
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:03.960]   And my journey on the science of bias
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:08.960]   started with the days of Philando Castile, Eric Garner,
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:12.400]   that whole summer of 2016,
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:17.400]   when we had this horrendous, horrendous situation
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:20.440]   of black people being killed by the police
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.520]   where they shot before asking,
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:25.000]   and people left to die in the most inhumane way
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.160]   for the rest of us to watch from the social media.
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:29.960]   That's me.
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:31.480]   That's when my George Floyd moment happened,
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:32.320]   not three or four years ago,
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.200]   and the whole world is like, you know.
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:38.720]   So that sent me on a journey
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.160]   of understanding what discrimination is and bias is.
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:45.560]   And in a way, that's the reason why I started this company
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:47.160]   that I even called Skinny Skin.
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:49.280]   That's where it came from.
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.240]   Again, criticized by creating.
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:54.000]   I needed to understand what discrimination was,
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.240]   how does it work?
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.080]   Is it true what Kendi is saying?
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:58.800]   Is it true what D'Angelo is saying?
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.800]   Is it true that it could be that you're racist
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.680]   just because of the skin color you happen to be born in?
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:07.520]   Is it true?
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:09.440]   Is it true?
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:10.920]   I needed to know,
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.840]   because I was at a time of my life where,
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:16.960]   at some point, when those killings were happening,
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:19.080]   it was so hard for me,
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.240]   being a black person in this country,
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:22.920]   and wondering,
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:29.720]   I mean, what is this?
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:32.000]   And what do we do with this?
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.160]   - Yeah, is it true?
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:38.920]   How much discrimination am I operating under in the system?
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:39.760]   - All of that.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:42.800]   - You need to understand the full characteristics of,
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:45.560]   if you're dreaming of making a big change
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:47.160]   by building companies,
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:49.520]   you have to kind of intuit,
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:51.160]   how much, what am I up against?
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.680]   And so this is why,
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:54.960]   spend all of this time on some of the work,
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:57.960]   and then eventually, I understood that discrimination,
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:25:59.880]   if you wanted to understand it beyond,
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.720]   beyond the big lines of,
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:05.640]   especially the clickbait lines,
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:07.960]   would make it very black and white.
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:09.440]   Then I had to really take a moment,
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:12.800]   and I spent time with a world of brain scientists,
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:15.840]   with behavioral psychologists,
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:17.640]   with evolutionary biologists,
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:19.440]   to have all of this ecosystem,
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:22.600]   but together, form what one might call,
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:24.560]   the science of bias.
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:27.920]   And especially, I came across the work
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:30.960]   of this team of scientists at the University of,
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:32.640]   I think it's Wisconsin,
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:35.160]   and they're the only ones who made sense,
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.280]   in this sea of nonsense back then.
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.840]   And this article was in Politico,
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:46.240]   and it was saying something that I could relate to it.
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:48.960]   And eventually, what I learned was,
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.960]   and this part comes from the evolutionary biologists people,
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:56.640]   they, in a way, tell you that right around age three,
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:58.120]   it can happen sooner or later,
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:59.920]   because we're all different,
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:01.840]   but you go from this person
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:03.960]   who has to rely on these other people,
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:06.360]   usually your parents, to stay alive,
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.920]   to be fed, to be housed,
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:09.560]   to even your diaper change,
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.440]   all of that stuff, right?
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:14.040]   To now, something is kicking in,
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:20.320]   where you have to, in order for you to survive,
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:23.280]   and this is all wired in,
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:25.600]   so you don't even understand it consciously,
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:26.720]   as I'm saying it now,
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:29.640]   where in order for you to survive,
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.840]   in order for you to go from this state of dependency
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:35.600]   to the next stage, and more, and more, and more,
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:37.520]   you're gonna have to develop this ability
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:39.280]   to make sense of the world.
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.720]   And what's making sense of the world
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:43.320]   at its most basic level means is,
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:46.400]   can you determine if a situation
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.800]   or a person is good or bad for you?
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:54.200]   Failure, and you need to be able to do so ever so quickly,
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:56.640]   because failure to be able to do that
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.320]   means that you might not be alive the next second.
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:02.800]   See, it's so wired in.
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:04.760]   So this process is starting to kick in,
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:07.560]   and at that point,
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.880]   your brain is gonna be your best ally for that.
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:12.760]   And the brain is gonna be your best ally
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:16.160]   and what the brain is gonna do is it's gonna help you,
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:18.400]   and the way the brain works is through,
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.560]   it works with, it's all wired for efficiency.
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:27.560]   And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation,
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:29.280]   meaning that every time it has computed,
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:30.840]   and you probably know these things way better than me,
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:34.400]   every time it has computed one algorithm,
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:36.760]   it doesn't want to do it again.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:40.280]   It's almost like this, okay, got it, stored, stored, right?
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:42.680]   And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.520]   to it, but it has to be something new,
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:46.400]   meaning the new level of complexity
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:49.000]   for it to even be willing to reconsider.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.520]   Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden,
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:54.040]   what you have is these neurons in the back of your head
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:56.640]   and they have created pathways, right?
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:59.880]   So, and every time neurons have created pathway
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:03.480]   among themselves, because basically they're attached,
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:05.760]   and here's a pathway, well, this pathway
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:10.760]   in the world of bias, science of bias, it's a habit.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:13.960]   In general, it's a habit when they form two pathways,
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:15.680]   when they form a pathway, it's a habit.
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:19.560]   So if we're willing to talk about unconscious bias,
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:21.960]   because of course it's very different
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:24.280]   from somebody who tells me to my face,
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:29.520]   there's no world in which you or I could ever be equal
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:31.000]   because you're black and I'm white,
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.800]   you're a woman, I'm a man, this, this, and that,
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.960]   that people like that, again, 1% of psychopaths
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:39.920]   in our world, they're out there.
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:41.920]   Unfortunately, by the time they do nasty things,
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:44.440]   it's pretty horrible and that's what all we hear about.
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:46.280]   But I'm talking mostly about the rest of us.
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:48.680]   Remember when I told you that most of us are good people,
[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:51.360]   bumbling along, making it up as we're going.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.120]   That's why I have compassion for human nature.
[02:29:54.120 --> 02:29:57.280]   So, but really, in the morning when I wake up,
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.200]   do you really think that I'm waking up and thinking,
[02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:00.200]   how am I going to go kill?
[02:30:00.200 --> 02:30:01.480]   How am I going to go kill Lex?
[02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:02.880]   That Lex guy needs to go down.
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.800]   He's a man, he's a, don't take me wrong.
[02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:06.240]   I'm sure there are some women who feel like that,
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.600]   but I'm not one of them and I do think a majority of us
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:10.120]   are not, whatever.
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:12.920]   But in the morning I'm waking up, I'm just like,
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.400]   gee, can I get my tea?
[02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:18.160]   Oh, my dog is not looking okay today.
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:22.680]   You know, we've got, right?
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:25.680]   - It's a lot going on and so you're using these kind of,
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:27.000]   just like you said, brilliantly,
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.280]   the brain has a bunch of simplifications it's built up
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:32.840]   and it uses those simplifications to get through the day.
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:34.560]   - It's through the day, exactly.
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:37.960]   So then here you are needing to make sense of a world
[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:39.960]   and then the brain is your best ally in that.
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:41.480]   The way it's going to do it is for efficiency,
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:43.400]   efficiency done through automation.
[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:46.520]   So every time it thinks it's figured something out,
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:47.840]   it's never going to think about it again.
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:49.840]   So that's how you build all of these habits
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:52.360]   of unconscious bias, because everything,
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:54.720]   so it's somewhere along the line,
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:59.440]   you come up with the information that black man
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:01.720]   walking around with a hoodie equals danger.
[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:03.240]   So later, what do you see?
[02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:07.880]   Whether it's like, oh my God, I'm walking in the dark alley,
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:09.200]   I see a black man with a hoodie,
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:10.120]   maybe I'm going to run away
[02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:13.000]   because I've been given that information.
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.640]   So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware
[02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:21.640]   and the software it runs on is, what do you call it?
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.600]   Is a cultural imprint.
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:26.120]   All of this information that we're getting
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:28.320]   from the Disney movies that you're reading,
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:30.920]   telling you that damsels are to be saved by the prince
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:33.680]   and all of that stuff and girls wear pink and whatever.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:36.360]   You watch the movies and all the movies,
[02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:38.120]   whenever you watch them, it's about Africa,
[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:39.520]   they're talking to you about the blood diamonds
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:40.760]   or they're talking to you about slavery
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:41.640]   or they're talking to you about this.
[02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:43.200]   And then of wonder you walk away thinking
[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.920]   that all the ills of Africa are caused
[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:47.520]   because of resource extraction, the diamonds,
[02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:49.400]   or they're always fighting each other.
[02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:54.400]   Look at the movie, or slavery all the time.
[02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:56.680]   You walk away and this is it.
[02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:58.160]   And we all programmed along the same line.
[02:31:58.160 --> 02:31:59.840]   See, that's the beauty of it.
[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:02.400]   All of us are, because even some black people
[02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:05.520]   who are gonna claim, but this is not what they registered.
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:06.680]   Really?
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:08.600]   So the truth, so then when I learned all of this,
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:11.360]   I'm like, wow, this concept of if you've got a brain,
[02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:14.680]   you've got biases, it comes with a territory.
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:15.720]   That makes sense.
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:19.880]   Now, it doesn't mean we can't transcend
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:22.840]   that function of a brain and that we should transcend it.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:25.120]   Right?
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:25.960]   But I think it's very important
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:27.760]   because once you understand that,
[02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:30.400]   a little bit more peace is created among us
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:32.120]   because this is not about a black and white
[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:34.120]   or a yellow and green issue.
[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:36.960]   It's about, we are human issue.
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.960]   And these are part of the things we develop
[02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:42.080]   to stay around.
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:45.400]   Just like we no longer have to rely on,
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:50.960]   this fear of flight, ability of a brain
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:54.640]   because bears over there start running and running fast.
[02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:55.480]   Right?
[02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:56.320]   Today, where are the bears?
[02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:57.160]   Show me where they are.
[02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:02.160]   We have kept this tendency to go for fear of flight.
[02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:03.440]   I don't know how they say it.
[02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:05.600]   And so we have this, you know,
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:08.440]   courtesan done by the stress, you know, stress triggers.
[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:11.520]   But back in the days, we have a stress trigger, we run
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:14.120]   and it's all, you know, expelled out.
[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:15.920]   But today we get triggers
[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:17.120]   and we don't know what to do with it
[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:18.840]   because where would we run to?
[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:19.680]   What do we do?
[02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:21.600]   The bear is not even here.
[02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:23.360]   So same thing here with that.
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:25.840]   And so then you realize there's this whole thing
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:29.120]   that is now what you understand is that this problem
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:32.760]   is not about anti-racism BS, but it is about,
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:36.400]   can each one of us do the work where the work is needed,
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:38.520]   which is we look inside.
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:41.640]   Can we go for this work of deprogrammation,
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:45.320]   this concept of a mindful practice
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:49.560]   of undoing the habit of bias?
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:52.240]   - And that doesn't necessarily have to do
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:55.480]   with a simple categorization of black and white.
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:56.320]   It's all kinds of biases.
[02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:57.440]   - It's about everything.
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:58.920]   It's about everything.
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:01.000]   And you know, when I started on that journey
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.160]   and me and my friend back then built, you know,
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:06.600]   this practice of undoing your habit of unconscious bias,
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:11.400]   we had all types of people come and say,
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:16.080]   "Wow, I discovered that my bias is against larger people."
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.960]   And I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:21.920]   "Well, I think I, it seems to me like I felt
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:24.480]   that larger people maybe are dumb."
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:28.120]   No, we heard things and you know, and you don't judge.
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:28.960]   - Yeah.
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:29.800]   - You don't judge.
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:32.800]   And so, and you see, it's at every level, you know,
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:35.800]   like, I don't know, like there's even this one friend,
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:36.960]   she was like, "You know, when I looked into
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:39.520]   the whole dating thing, I absolutely didn't want to have,
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:40.480]   you know, date Asian men."
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.560]   Because she went, her mind was into some stereotypes
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.520]   about the size of whatever.
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:47.360]   And she was like, "No."
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:50.080]   But you see, once you start,
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:51.480]   because there's this whole thing of,
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:54.240]   it's the five-step thing, bias awareness,
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:58.800]   this, basically, at this level, what you're doing is,
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.080]   you're learning to spot the biases in our culture,
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:04.440]   because that's where the cultural imprint comes from.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.960]   You're watching this movie and you're realizing,
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:08.360]   just like I said, "Wow, gee, I realized, once again,
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:11.360]   the black person is portrayed like the thug of a movie."
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:15.360]   Or, you know, the Latina lady,
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:16.720]   this is how she's been portrayed.
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:18.800]   And you're seeing it everywhere, even the NPR.
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:20.960]   NPR is happening, like you're listening to something
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:23.640]   like NPR, you've got to be more liberal than that.
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:26.200]   And this gentleman is asking these two candidates,
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:27.920]   one of them is a woman, political candidates,
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:29.080]   the other one is a man.
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:31.080]   I'm hearing him asking the lady a question
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:32.600]   that I know he's not going to ask the man,
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:33.720]   and he didn't ask her.
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:38.720]   He said, "How do you balance your race with family?
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:41.960]   Does the man not have a family?"
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:46.120]   Right there, you see, it's very subtle.
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:49.000]   But you see, but because now my mind is kind of trained
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.240]   to see things, I'm like, "Hmm, interesting."
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:53.200]   Or like when the media just says,
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:57.640]   "Froze climate change issue on something,"
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:59.920]   without even the choice of words.
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:01.640]   So it's pretty much everywhere.
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:03.160]   You open a book everywhere.
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.040]   - The interesting thing though,
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.280]   you mean even that man-woman example,
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:11.920]   is I think it's really powerful
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:14.000]   to bring that bias to the surface,
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.520]   but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis.
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:20.960]   You should almost, I mean, that's where humor is,
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:23.320]   make fun of it, bring it to the surface.
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:25.760]   Like acknowledge the fact that those things
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:27.160]   are a part of the conversation.
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.880]   And a lot of them are, it is, you know,
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:33.240]   it's a cultural imprint because it's part of culture.
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:34.760]   And that might be, there could be, you know,
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:36.640]   I grew up in the Soviet Union
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.800]   where the gender roles were stronger than in other places.
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:40.640]   - That's right.
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:41.480]   - And that's part of the culture.
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:44.400]   We have to acknowledge that this is how,
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:45.800]   this is affecting how I think.
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:48.320]   You might, we might like how that works,
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:50.360]   or we might not, but we have to acknowledge it.
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:53.040]   And not get, you know, make it part of humor,
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.520]   make fun of yourself, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.360]   - That's the thing.
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:00.160]   And so Lex, that's why this first step is bias awareness.
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:01.680]   So you get, you train yourself,
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:03.080]   oh yeah, okay, that was one.
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.960]   Or it's, you know, and it's about, it's in you.
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:07.200]   We're talking about you, we're not.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:08.840]   And then from there, you're like,
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:12.720]   replace the bias, like bias replacement.
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:17.400]   Then it is where you practice the empathy.
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:19.720]   You're like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:21.280]   every day I walk into a store,
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:22.760]   and the guy thinks he should be following me
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:24.320]   because maybe I can, I might steal something
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:25.760]   because I'm black, right?
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.240]   Because once you try that,
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:28.680]   to put yourself in the other person's shoes,
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:31.240]   all of a sudden, something else starts to click.
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:35.240]   And then from there, you go on to making connection.
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:37.840]   Then you're making a connection,
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:39.760]   and then things start to change.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:43.120]   Because now you, no, you're making,
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:45.160]   then you make cultural immersion.
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:46.440]   So this is where we had some people,
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:48.040]   like this one woman, she was very,
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:51.520]   quite, very feminist-oriented.
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:56.000]   And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.320]   And because for her, it was like,
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.920]   how come you, how come, how come you,
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:03.160]   you just lower, you know, like,
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:06.280]   how come you're accepting this demeaning of yourself,
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:09.600]   not understanding everything else that comes with it?
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:13.560]   But through, as she understood that she even had that bias,
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:15.960]   then she went on through all the different processes,
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:18.200]   and then eventually, when comes the next step,
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:21.720]   cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:24.000]   during Ramadan, when the Muslims are doing,
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.000]   you know, it's the holy month of fasting,
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.920]   and then we break at night.
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:32.360]   And she started understanding very different things.
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.040]   And eventually happens the last step
[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:35.760]   that happens naturally,
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:38.840]   making a true, real, genuine connection.
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:40.760]   And this is where friendships happen.
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:43.240]   This is where, that's it, your bias can go home now,
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:46.240]   because it has been challenged with reality
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:47.360]   and understanding.
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:51.360]   And so for me, that is what I was after.
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:53.720]   And then, but then the world was just like,
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:55.800]   we don't want to be told we're part of a problem.
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:38:59.200]   So, but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness,
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:00.640]   type of practice that's going to need to happen.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.160]   And it's one that's very internal to you.
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.560]   It is not, and it happens, everybody at their own pace.
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:10.480]   So all of this, I take it back
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:15.480]   to the racism, the question you were asking me.
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:17.480]   Does racism exist?
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:18.520]   Yes, it does.
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.320]   Is it going to stop me from doing anything I want to do?
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:21.160]   No.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:22.000]   Is it going to make it harder?
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:22.960]   No.
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.480]   But this is where, for anybody who is serious
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:32.040]   about making sure, about fighting racism,
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:36.240]   I think the only job you have to do
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:40.360]   is to make sure that people
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:42.040]   keep their sense of self-agency.
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:45.400]   And B, can you help provide people
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:49.040]   with the tools to stand up?
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:52.600]   So this is why I have so much respect for Van Jones.
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:54.160]   People like Van Jones,
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:56.280]   although I disagree with him on so many things,
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:00.440]   but people like Ms. Alice Johnson,
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:03.080]   she was pardoned by President Trump
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:05.480]   through the work of people like Van Jones
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:08.120]   and Kim Kardashian and others.
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:09.760]   They all joined forces.
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.640]   This is a case where people of,
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.520]   and those folks then went on to combine forces.
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:20.520]   Furthermore, no regard given to their political belongings.
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.800]   They said, if the issue is criminal justice reform,
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.520]   then anybody who stands for it has to come together.
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:32.160]   And so what they did in this situation with,
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:37.120]   what they're doing, criminal justice reform, in my mind,
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:42.120]   is a valid action to fight racism in my mind.
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:45.080]   Because what are you doing there?
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:47.120]   You're trying to get people out of jail
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:49.520]   who really have no business being there.
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:52.720]   And also when you have people like Bishop Omar
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.280]   and the people, he passed away, unfortunately,
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:57.920]   but today we have Anton Luckey,
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:01.200]   who was in jail for having killed his cousin.
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:08.960]   I think he started the gang in South Dallas.
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.400]   So we're talking really tough guy
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:13.400]   who was really on the wrong side of the equation.
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:16.640]   And then in jail, literally he found Plato,
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:17.920]   the cave and all of that.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.840]   So today these people,
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:22.400]   I'm like, why don't we hear more about them,
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:23.960]   the urban specialists?
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:25.280]   Because these people,
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:28.360]   it's not about the anti-racism crap of Kandil D'Angelo,
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.680]   I'll say it again until the cows come home,
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:33.240]   but it is about we go where help is needed.
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:38.240]   We go in urban, inner city,
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:40.240]   black inner city neighborhoods,
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:43.320]   and block by block, we change the culture.
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:45.560]   And they say it like that, it's their words.
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:47.080]   These are African-American people
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:48.720]   who have as many rights as anybody else
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.160]   to talk about their own culture.
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.760]   And they will tell you, we have to change the culture.
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:55.880]   I have some videos like that on my YouTube
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:41:57.600]   with Bishop Omar.
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:59.960]   What these people are doing is what we need to do.
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:01.240]   Bishop will explain, he says,
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:04.600]   sometimes people are their feet
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:06.440]   and feet deep down in the mud.
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:11.240]   And what we have to do is to try to pull them up.
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:13.520]   And you cannot say you didn't pull them up
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:15.320]   because we're not seeing their head out yet,
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:18.600]   but how much progress have they made from the bottom
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:22.200]   to where they are now and keep going.
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:24.520]   So what I see these people doing,
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:26.360]   you see, I have so much,
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:29.360]   I love and respect Glenlarion Company,
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:30.680]   and Ian Rove and all of those guys.
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:31.640]   I love them.
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:34.240]   I love a lot of the things that they say.
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:37.720]   This whole concept of personal responsibility,
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:38.920]   we don't know that.
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:40.320]   But I'm just like, at some point,
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:43.760]   it also needs to be matched up with real actions.
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:46.720]   And that's what the people like Anton Luckey,
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.120]   urban specialist, Alice Johnson are doing.
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:51.200]   They're going where it's hard.
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:52.840]   Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:54.840]   every single day, literally.
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:57.400]   And then people like Anton Luckey and his team
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:01.120]   are giving them the tools to live the gang life,
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:05.280]   to be better people, to go for a life of redemption.
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:07.120]   This is happening right now.
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:08.600]   But what I find is they're not getting
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:10.280]   the bulk of the attention.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:13.640]   But this is, anybody who's serious about,
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:17.360]   this is why, how I would love to see people do anti-racism
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:21.520]   is help lift people up for real.
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:23.640]   - Action. - Support, support
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:25.960]   a school choice.
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:28.160]   Support school choice.
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:30.840]   Black mamas, they know what's going on.
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:32.880]   And when they tell you we want school choice,
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:34.000]   they know what they're talking about.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.400]   They're not idiots.
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:36.960]   - Especially at the local level.
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:37.800]   - Yes.
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:38.840]   - Helping them at the local level.
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:42.840]   - Yes, so help them make sure that they can take their kids
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:44.720]   out of these public schools
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:48.240]   that are doing horrendous things to them.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:50.440]   Miss Virginia, watch that movie.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:55.160]   How could you not support black moms in this country
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:57.600]   to take their kids to safety when it comes to education?
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:59.120]   How come not?
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.840]   That's what I wanna see happen.
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:04.560]   And not like some, yeah, let's go to some classrooms
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:06.720]   and everybody's white, you go over here.
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:08.960]   Everybody's a neck stain, you go over here
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:10.640]   and kids, let us tell you about this.
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:13.280]   No, no, no, no.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:15.920]   As a black person, I don't want you to do any of that crap.
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:19.680]   Let me grow my wings.
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:22.240]   If you want, help put some fuel behind them
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.560]   and let me take my flight.
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:24.800]   That's all I'm asking for.
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:26.480]   That's the only way for you to do,
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:30.440]   that's the only way for you to be part of a racism battle
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:32.200]   if that's what you think is the most important battle
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:33.440]   of our life.
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:34.280]   That's it.
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:35.400]   That's what I have to say about that.
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:37.640]   And so for me, I'm keeping my head very straight.
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:42.640]   It's about what enables black people to thrive.
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:49.000]   I don't need for you to be an activist on my behalf.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.400]   No, because when you're doing that,
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:52.800]   you're doing exactly what you've been doing to us
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:55.160]   black people in Africa our whole life.
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:56.920]   I don't need your white savior complex
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:59.360]   because that's what anti-racism is, white savior complex.
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:00.680]   That stuff doesn't work.
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:02.640]   It only works to make you feel better
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.360]   about how superior you are to me.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:07.040]   But it does nothing, absolutely nothing
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:08.400]   to change my everyday life.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.280]   If it is not, if it is, at least in the African side
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:14.760]   to actually even change my, you know,
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:17.560]   turn me into somebody who's waiting for handouts.
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:20.800]   So if people, I would encourage people to really,
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:23.000]   those people who are really serious
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.560]   about wanting to be part of a solution.
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:26.440]   And I know there are many out there,
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:28.480]   for the love of God and everything that's out there
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:31.480]   and we care about, stop.
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:35.960]   It's about, think about what's gonna enable people.
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:40.640]   Maybe the word is wrongly chosen,
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:42.240]   but know what I'm talking about.
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:45.000]   - Yeah, give them the freedom to spread their wings.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.040]   - Yes, give a person, yeah,
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:49.040]   learn to teach a person how to fish
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:50.680]   and don't give them a fish.
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:53.040]   When you're putting your stupid signs on the lawn
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:55.040]   with Black Lives Matter and all that crap,
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:55.960]   you're not helping.
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:58.440]   And when you're buying one more anti-racism book
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.920]   or as a company, you know, financing one more DEI,
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.480]   you know, if it's done along those lines,
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:06.920]   I think we've got a problem.
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:11.920]   - Yeah, so you do think that the efforts of diversity,
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:16.200]   equity and inclusion are often not effective?
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:17.280]   - Not only are they not effective,
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:18.720]   but they also backfire.
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:20.600]   And there are reports on all of this.
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:25.440]   And at the end of the day, it makes sense.
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:26.760]   It makes sense.
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:29.680]   So for me, I am very, very glad
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:34.160]   that people have developed an enlightenment about this.
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:37.560]   Very happy about that, very.
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:42.560]   But let us not keep going for the easy perceived solution
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.120]   to problems.
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:47.880]   Again, they've done this to us, the poor people of Africa.
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.880]   They thought the solution was to give.
[02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:53.880]   It does not work.
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:55.760]   And then they say, "Oh, we're gonna do
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:59.960]   a social entrepreneurship on you, Tom's Shoes.
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:01.960]   Buy one pair of shoes and we give one pair of shoes
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:04.520]   to some people in poor countries."
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:06.080]   Then guess what happened to us?
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:09.280]   You know, in the town where we operate in Senegal,
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:11.160]   where I have my little manufacturing,
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:15.920]   we have 2000 little mom and pop businesses.
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:18.640]   And guess what they happen to be in, Lex?
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:21.320]   Shoemakers, right?
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:23.720]   So every shoemakers, each one of them
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:26.160]   hires at least five, 15 people.
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:27.000]   Do the math.
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.320]   Family businesses.
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:33.160]   Guess what happens to them the day
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:36.560]   the Tom's Shoes truck shows up with bunch of free shoes?
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:39.960]   - Yeah.
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:42.240]   - Who can compete against free?
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:44.160]   Now, all of these people, little by little,
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:45.240]   gonna have to close their shops
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:46.720]   because who can compete against free?
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:49.600]   'Cause Tom's Shoes dumping all of his shoes on them.
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:50.520]   And then they go out of business.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:53.200]   And now, instead of helping anybody,
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:54.960]   you actually sent all the kids
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:59.000]   who depended on these adults working in these places,
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.440]   now they have to join the rank of kids
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:01.800]   who need to be given shoes
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:05.760]   because you took their parents' ability
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:10.400]   to make money through their wages, buy them shoes.
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:12.280]   You see?
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:14.120]   So first they said, "We just have to give."
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:19.080]   So that was primarily the charity business.
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.640]   And you still have foreign aid business going on.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:24.400]   So we just need to give.
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:27.440]   And then the social entrepreneurs came in place.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.720]   But I'm like, "The only person for this is business is good
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:32.600]   "is for Blake McCarthy, the founder of Tom's Shoes.
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:34.720]   "But other than that, I'm not sure really seeing
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:36.560]   "who else is winning from this."
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:39.720]   And so today, my whole thing is,
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:46.000]   we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.080]   or to have a mind for the lesser fortunate,
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:50.560]   maybe in this country.
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.280]   It is easy.
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:53.120]   And lesser fortunate,
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:56.200]   because for anybody that you feel like
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:58.160]   is being trampled upon because of something,
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:00.680]   maybe it's because of economic circumstances
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:02.800]   or maybe it's race in this case, whatever.
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:08.120]   To have a heart for the lesser fortunate among us,
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:12.600]   for whatever reason, that's easy.
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:15.480]   But to have a mind for them, that's the challenge.
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:18.560]   - Let me ask you a difficult question.
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:19.520]   - Yeah.
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:22.720]   - As if we were not already asking difficult questions.
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.640]   The president of Senegal, Maggie Sall,
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:30.000]   is also now the chair of the African Union.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:35.000]   He met with the president of Vladimir Putin on June 3rd.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:39.280]   I think primarily was to discuss food security.
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:40.320]   - Security.
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:44.480]   - Africa seems to be split halfway
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:46.840]   on their perspective in the war in Ukraine.
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.640]   So broadly speaking, what do you think about this?
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:53.720]   First of all, the geopolitics of Africa
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.280]   and the geopolitical relationship of Africa
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:01.800]   with the rest of the world and its current conflict
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:04.680]   with the war in Ukraine.
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:07.040]   What are your thoughts there?
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:09.560]   - Well, you've seen that many countries,
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:13.040]   when it was time to vote, some of them abstained,
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:15.640]   which in a way says something.
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:17.880]   I think for the Africans today,
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:20.200]   especially as represented by the African Union,
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:23.200]   because not all countries fall in this along the same lines,
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:27.160]   I feel like again, we're back to way back.
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:30.920]   For the longest time, the West tries to tell us what to do.
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.840]   They decide for us.
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:37.520]   And here, there's trouble,
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:42.400]   meaning there's definitely a rift, major one,
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:44.400]   between most of the Western world
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:48.120]   as represented by Europe and America primarily,
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:49.920]   and you have Australia and all that.
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:53.240]   And then they're saying,
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:57.000]   I think this is more or less an attempt
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.000]   to stand on their own as a country
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:03.240]   on their own as well.
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:07.240]   It's like, don't tell us what to do, as usual.
[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:09.680]   You always rope us in with, when it makes sense for you,
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:10.800]   you try to rope us in,
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:13.000]   and then we're left hanging on our own.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000]   So this goes back to the sentiment
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:16.800]   you were talking about earlier.
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:21.800]   It's been challenging for me to watch this,
[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:26.480]   because remember, I have one foot also,
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:28.680]   because there's what I get to see and hear
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:31.840]   from being in the Western world,
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:34.240]   but there's also what I get to see and hear
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:37.040]   from when I'm back home.
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:38.720]   So I wear all hats.
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:44.640]   And I think this is a situation where the African Union
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:48.440]   and African nations in general are saying,
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:52.720]   we don't, this is a case where one was like,
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:53.840]   you guys are fighting.
[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:56.560]   You guys are fighting.
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:51:59.480]   Maybe for once, we have to watch out for ourselves.
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:04.480]   - Yeah, there's a sense in which this is the embodiment
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:08.360]   sort of abstaining from a vote on the war in Ukraine
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:12.960]   is a political embodiment of a resistance
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:14.880]   to the influence of the West.
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:16.840]   It's not about the war between,
[02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:18.440]   whatever you guys are fighting.
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:23.440]   It's saying, we're not going to let this particular empire
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:26.880]   that seems to be at the top right now,
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.360]   which is the United States empire in Europe,
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:33.840]   to dominate our political discourse,
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:36.640]   our geopolitical considerations.
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:38.960]   It's almost like, no, we're not touching this.
[02:52:38.960 --> 02:52:40.880]   - Yeah, especially if it's given usually.
[02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:43.920]   So when they need us, again, for influence,
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:45.320]   which means more power,
[02:52:45.320 --> 02:52:47.800]   oh, you guys vote the same way we do.
[02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:52.800]   And when it's all over and they go back to spreading,
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:54.480]   they go back to, how do you say that?
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:59.240]   They go back to exchanging and sharing between themselves
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:03.120]   the goodies of their Halloween collection.
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:07.640]   We're not there when the goodies are being shared.
[02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:11.600]   So I think it's definitely one of those situations.
[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:14.600]   But for me, it still is hard
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:17.080]   because I watch everything that's going on
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:23.320]   and it's going to be complicated,
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:25.320]   the ramifications of all of this.
[02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:28.720]   I would like to see our African leaders also,
[02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:30.520]   what they're doing is clear,
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:34.000]   but this is a place where I'm also tempted to say,
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.720]   yes and.
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:42.440]   Yes to the reasons you're advancing right now.
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:47.240]   We don't want to be always siding because we're tired.
[02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:49.520]   We're tired of always being dragged around
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:52.000]   and taken for granted and you vote our way.
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:55.600]   Come on guys, when you need us,
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:57.280]   we're great and everything is good.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:59.640]   And then when it's time to go and share the goodies,
[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:01.160]   we don't exist anymore.
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:04.560]   And you actually go for policies that go against us.
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.400]   But in this situation though,
[02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:09.800]   I would like to still see us do the right thing.
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:14.800]   In my case, I was not very happy to see us going
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:17.360]   and more or less begging for,
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:21.280]   what do you call it?
[02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:26.160]   Cereals, you know, oh, please let the cereals make it.
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:28.360]   So at least we get them and we don't starve.
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:31.440]   I can understand why a president
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:33.200]   would say something like that
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.480]   or try to negotiate something like that.
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:39.320]   But when it comes to an African president
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:44.320]   having to do that with a non-African president,
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:47.840]   I'm sorry, but for me, it's too close to begging.
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:49.200]   - Listen, it's hard to be a leader.
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:50.560]   It's such a difficult dance
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:55.560]   because in some sense, sort of the flip side of that
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:59.600]   is you're creating a market,
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:01.720]   a geopolitical market of saying,
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:05.400]   we're willing to sit down at the table with America,
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:10.400]   with European leaders, with Russian leaders, with China.
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:13.880]   And we're gonna let you guys convince us
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:17.080]   who we should collaborate with.
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:21.720]   And that's what sort of great nations
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.560]   and groups of nations do.
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:25.560]   Now, there's a cynical, of course,
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.000]   a dark perspective of that
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:31.160]   because what's in that game played by leaders,
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:34.360]   the people that hurt, people of Ukraine hurt,
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:36.400]   people of Africa can hurt.
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:37.280]   - People of Russia.
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:40.120]   - People of Russia can hurt, people of China,
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:41.280]   people of the United States.
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:44.920]   But it is the way of the world.
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:49.000]   And you have to earn respect.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.160]   And sometimes earning respect
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:52.920]   leads to the suffering of many.
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:56.160]   - Well, but except in this case, yes to all of that.
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:59.840]   And the reason why I'm actually upset
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:01.920]   with going and being like,
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:03.920]   oh, can you let at least the boats
[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:06.000]   that are supposed to come to Africa full of cereals
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.160]   come over, the wheat and all that,
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:11.560]   it's just like, look, Africa has the highest land
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:13.240]   that you can do agriculture on.
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:14.080]   - Yes.
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:18.200]   - We have a larger surface, such surface in the world.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:21.480]   Why is this not a time for us to try
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:23.520]   to wean ourselves off of cereals
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:26.440]   that we don't necessarily have on the ground?
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:29.320]   But no, let us go and plead.
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:31.920]   - Don't beg, create instead.
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:33.320]   - Create instead, exactly.
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:34.520]   This should have been,
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:36.480]   you know, just like how the rest of the world,
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:39.480]   when COVID happened and China had to close off
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:40.320]   for different reasons.
[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:42.640]   And since then has not completely reopened
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:44.400]   and people have started to realize,
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:47.000]   wow, we've got too much,
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.600]   we're too dependent on China for a lot of what we need.
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:53.040]   So we're gonna have to bring back some production
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:56.240]   to the US, the Europeans are doing the same, all of that.
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:59.280]   This should have been a time for African leaders
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:02.080]   to be like, we need to be serious now
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.880]   about food security.
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:08.400]   And maybe the stuff that maybe don't grow
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.160]   under our climates necessarily,
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:12.480]   can we work on coming up with different things?
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:14.520]   Now I understand that it can take time,
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:17.520]   but if I knew that that was happening at the same time
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:20.240]   that we're saying, oh, well, let the cereals come in,
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:22.240]   maybe I would be a little bit easier with it.
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:23.720]   But right now I'm just like,
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:25.560]   is it gonna be the same business as usual?
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:26.920]   And in this case, I'm just like,
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:30.920]   are we gonna keep going from one masa to another masa?
[02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:31.760]   I mean, really?
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:35.080]   - The interesting aspect of all of this
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:37.000]   is if we look at all of human history,
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.360]   it's possible that the 21st century is defined by Africa.
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:41.800]   - It will be.
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:45.640]   - And the young people, the huge number of young people,
[02:57:45.640 --> 02:57:47.320]   it's like the trajectory could be,
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.640]   there's so much possibility to define
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:52.560]   the future of human civilization in Africa.
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:55.440]   And I don't mean sort of in the next 10 years,
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:57.400]   I mean in the next 50 years.
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:03.280]   So some people are concerned about overpopulation,
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:05.600]   some people are concerned about
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:07.720]   us dying out as a human species.
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:12.320]   - Both of those people live in Austin.
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:13.480]   Talk to me often about-
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:14.320]   - I know, I know.
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:18.200]   I know, I know who they are.
[02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:22.720]   - What's your, in Africa, is it the center of this?
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:26.440]   Because there is a vibrant, huge number,
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:28.840]   probably over a billion people.
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:30.560]   - Yeah, we're 1.3 billion people
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.480]   and of those, one billion blacks.
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:36.760]   - I mean, where do you land on that?
[02:58:36.760 --> 02:58:41.040]   - There is a reason, Lex, why I say I'm haunted,
[02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:45.520]   that I'm obsessed, that I'm monomaniacal
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:47.360]   when it comes to the free markets
[02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:50.280]   and that I have such a strong sense of urgency
[02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:53.680]   to the point that literally it is affecting me.
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:56.080]   And it has to do with the fact that, yes,
[02:58:56.080 --> 02:58:58.520]   you have the youngest region on earth
[02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:01.360]   in terms of the age of its population
[02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:05.720]   and the rate at which it's growing demographic-wise
[02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:09.880]   I am not willing to stay there and say,
[02:59:09.880 --> 02:59:12.120]   it's a curse for humanity,
[02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:14.800]   but it will be a curse for humanity
[02:59:14.800 --> 02:59:19.080]   if we don't make sure that these people,
[02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:24.520]   our youth, gets to partake.
[02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:28.800]   And what it takes to partake is not much.
[02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:31.360]   So if the rest of the world thinks that
[02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:34.840]   get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid,
[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:38.520]   you have to have more charity businesses,
[02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:42.280]   I mean, charity organizations sending stuff our way,
[02:59:42.280 --> 02:59:46.440]   of course, you're almost thinking parasites.
[02:59:46.440 --> 02:59:47.960]   I'm sorry to say it this way.
[02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:49.760]   If this is what you're thinking,
[02:59:49.760 --> 02:59:52.760]   you're seeing us as no more than parasites.
[02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:55.360]   And if that's what it's gonna be,
[02:59:55.360 --> 02:59:58.160]   I could see why some people might be worried about that.
[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:04.000]   Although, humans should never be seen as parasites,
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:05.760]   no matter, no matter, no matter.
[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:08.760]   But some people will go there.
[03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:12.520]   Now, people are here.
[03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:16.320]   What are we gonna do, dispose of them?
[03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:17.800]   That's not an option.
[03:00:17.800 --> 03:00:20.120]   So the only option we have left
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:21.800]   is to make sure that people partake.
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:24.960]   And what partaking means is that people get included
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:31.520]   and are part of the systems that allow for human flourishing.
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:33.560]   And it's not much.
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:35.720]   In this case, it's about,
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:38.600]   can we be serious about the reforms?
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:42.600]   So we have free market zones, areas,
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:46.960]   where people, where the flourishing can start to take place.
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:52.440]   The wealth that people will need to flourish,
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:55.040]   they don't need you to give it to them.
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:58.360]   But it's all about, can I let you fly?
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:01.360]   And you will make it happen for you and also for me.
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:04.880]   Every young African I see today,
[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:07.600]   I realize how stupid the rest of the world is,
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:11.320]   if they're not supporting what I'm trying to talk about.
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:12.920]   'Cause even if you don't wanna do it
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:13.840]   because that's the right thing to do,
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:15.960]   which I think it is the right thing to do,
[03:01:15.960 --> 03:01:20.400]   you're selfish, maybe engage your selfishness.
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:21.720]   'Cause this person right there,
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:24.520]   remember I told you, seven billion geniuses,
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:26.120]   everybody came to this world
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:30.280]   with a piece of solution to the human problem.
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:32.920]   This person and that person and that person
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:37.080]   hold something for me, because I'm part of humanity.
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:40.840]   This person might have the cure to a cancer
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:44.080]   that might take my wife out, the wife I haven't met yet.
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:47.280]   But this kid right here has it inside.
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:50.720]   And if I help this, if I make sure
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:52.680]   that this kid gets a chance to flourish
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:56.200]   and to manifest his genius or her genius,
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:59.000]   that trickle down many years later,
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.800]   comes straight back to serve me and the love of my life.
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:04.440]   If we can't see it any other way,
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:06.760]   maybe let's try to think about it that way.
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:10.000]   'Cause it becomes a very good proposition at that point.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.000]   So in this case, by 2050, Lagos, Nigeria
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.560]   will be the largest city in the world.
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.480]   The future is African, whether we want it or not.
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:23.080]   But is it gonna be an African future
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:26.360]   where you have a youth being a ticking bomb?
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:31.360]   Because they have not, there's no hope.
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:34.920]   They stay in poverty because they belong to nations
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:36.240]   that don't even understand sometimes
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:40.120]   the importance of common law versus civil law.
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:43.840]   Because they're trapped in countries that don't understand
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:47.560]   that you need to make the legal framework
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:49.960]   to provide for better economic freedom.
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:53.960]   So you can unleash the genuineness, the awesomeness,
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:58.000]   the ingenuity, the industrious side of your young people,
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.240]   especially of your women,
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:01.800]   so that they build all the wealth
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:04.080]   that your nation is gonna need you to build.
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:06.360]   And with it, the respect that comes from that.
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:08.920]   See, we have a choice to make.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:12.680]   And this is why I feel so, so, so restless about this
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:14.840]   at this point of my life.
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:16.480]   We just lost George Hayete.
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:19.840]   George Hayete is one of the few Africans that I knew
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:23.360]   who put this out.
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:24.680]   That's who I learned from.
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:26.440]   He's gone.
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:30.120]   And I feel a strong sense of urgency
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:32.880]   to not only bring back to the table
[03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:34.920]   that which he has been working on,
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:38.440]   but to also make sure that it gets seen.
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:40.640]   That's why being here talking with you today,
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:44.160]   you have no idea.
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:49.320]   People ask, if someone like you could say, what can I do?
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:52.880]   You did more than you could ever imagine.
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:56.280]   By just allowing me to take this message to one more person.
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:03:59.600]   And because if we do this,
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:03.200]   the change is gonna happen somewhere down the line.
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.000]   - Yeah, the ripple effects of all of that
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.240]   on the unlocking the human potential
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:12.240]   of all those people in Africa building cool stuff,
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:13.160]   amazing things.
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:14.360]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:15.920]   So some are gonna be built stuff.
[03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:17.640]   Others are gonna work on the reforms.
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:19.160]   So we're working on reforms, by the way.
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:22.960]   I'm the head of the Africa Center for Prosperity
[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:23.960]   of the Atlas Network,
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:26.080]   the largest organization in the world,
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:28.920]   working on taking down barriers of entry for entrepreneurs
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:31.040]   around the world in their respective countries.
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:32.640]   So we're doing great work there.
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:37.280]   I basically, obviously all the think tanks we have
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:41.160]   in Africa right now, free market think tanks.
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:43.880]   And we wanna promote more of them to come up.
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:46.640]   And these are local solutions by local people
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:48.760]   for their local problems, always.
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.200]   That's where we draw the line.
[03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:55.200]   And so there, so we're working on reforms primarily
[03:04:55.200 --> 03:04:57.160]   and making people understand the free markets
[03:04:57.160 --> 03:04:58.440]   and the importance of it.
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:03.200]   But it is piecemeal legislation.
[03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:04.680]   It takes time.
[03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:05.840]   It is hard.
[03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:07.960]   By the time you accomplish something here,
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:09.640]   more crap has happened over here.
[03:05:09.640 --> 03:05:10.920]   More laws have been pounded out
[03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:13.480]   because you know how they fix a bad law most of the time.
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:14.720]   Whether it's in the US or somewhere else,
[03:05:14.720 --> 03:05:17.640]   put other laws to kind of undo the law from before,
[03:05:17.640 --> 03:05:18.920]   but it keeps stacking up.
[03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:20.360]   And before you know it,
[03:05:20.360 --> 03:05:22.520]   where you should have one thing and it's clear,
[03:05:22.520 --> 03:05:24.400]   you have a hundred and they go against each other
[03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:26.240]   and then it's all, it's worse.
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:28.960]   So we have piecemeal legislation, but happening,
[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:31.320]   our teams are doing really amazing, fantastic work,
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:34.040]   especially the team in Imani in Ghana.
[03:05:34.040 --> 03:05:37.160]   We have a group in Burundi, the Great Lakes.
[03:05:37.160 --> 03:05:40.480]   I mean, people are doing amazing work, amazing work,
[03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:42.160]   but we need to run faster.
[03:05:42.160 --> 03:05:45.320]   So while we help them running faster,
[03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:48.120]   we also have to unlock other things.
[03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:53.040]   And right now I'm working on one of my most craziest projects,
[03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:57.200]   something bold, radical, crazy for some people,
[03:05:57.200 --> 03:05:58.360]   but I know we're not crazy
[03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:00.400]   because before us, Singapore has done it.
[03:06:00.400 --> 03:06:03.400]   Hong Kong has done it.
[03:06:03.400 --> 03:06:06.000]   Latest, the most recent China with the SCZs,
[03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:09.600]   the special economic zones,
[03:06:09.600 --> 03:06:12.760]   some of the most radical free market zones in the world,
[03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:13.800]   they've done it.
[03:06:13.800 --> 03:06:16.440]   And oftentimes within a generation,
[03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:19.080]   meaningful change start to happen, right?
[03:06:19.080 --> 03:06:23.720]   So here, what I'm working on is this concept of,
[03:06:23.720 --> 03:06:27.280]   some call it charter cities, Paul Romer,
[03:06:27.280 --> 03:06:32.280]   others call it the free cities,
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:35.200]   and I like to call it startup cities.
[03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:37.560]   What these are is for us to think about,
[03:06:37.560 --> 03:06:40.600]   okay, if piecemeal legislation takes forever,
[03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:43.960]   while we have this demographic
[03:06:43.960 --> 03:06:46.920]   that's growing faster and faster in Africa,
[03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:48.120]   there is a discrepancy here
[03:06:48.120 --> 03:06:51.160]   between the progress we're making
[03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:55.240]   to set the right environment for business to prop up
[03:06:55.240 --> 03:06:58.720]   and how many more people are coming to life
[03:06:58.720 --> 03:07:02.400]   literally every day on the continent.
[03:07:02.400 --> 03:07:03.840]   There's a discrepancy here.
[03:07:03.840 --> 03:07:06.520]   And so the ticking bomb is going faster
[03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:09.320]   than the progress we can make.
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:10.720]   This is a problem.
[03:07:10.720 --> 03:07:12.320]   So what some of us are working on
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:14.760]   is this concept of a startup cities and to say,
[03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:18.440]   piecemeal legislation takes too long.
[03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:20.080]   How about we continue doing that work,
[03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:21.920]   which is essential and critical,
[03:07:21.920 --> 03:07:24.760]   but at the same time, can we think of zones,
[03:07:24.760 --> 03:07:27.800]   and I like to call them also common law zones,
[03:07:27.800 --> 03:07:32.760]   where we basically try to have within the country
[03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:35.160]   an area where for business,
[03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:37.240]   I'm not talking about family law or any of that stuff,
[03:07:37.240 --> 03:07:39.280]   no one is touching your culture or anything like that,
[03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:42.040]   but we're just saying business-wise,
[03:07:42.040 --> 03:07:45.120]   an enclave where you have the best practices
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:47.400]   from around the world, including yours,
[03:07:47.400 --> 03:07:51.600]   in terms of what constitutes a great business environment
[03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:54.640]   and allow people in.
[03:07:54.640 --> 03:07:57.680]   Like it's, you know, you get in freely
[03:07:57.680 --> 03:07:58.920]   or nobody's forcing you to go,
[03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:00.680]   nobody's forcing you to whatever.
[03:08:00.680 --> 03:08:04.640]   So basically you're to think about this
[03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:09.160]   rather unoccupied plot of land within a country
[03:08:09.160 --> 03:08:12.720]   think Dubai on 110 acres of land,
[03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:16.040]   Dubai is thinking that in their case,
[03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:18.520]   they're like, maybe they decided maybe Sharia law
[03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:20.680]   is not the best for business in their case.
[03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:22.360]   And they said, they looked around and were like,
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:24.920]   wow, but common law, especially British common law
[03:08:24.920 --> 03:08:26.640]   seems like a very good one.
[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:29.800]   So at that point, they decided for business only,
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:31.200]   not family or anything like that,
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:33.480]   which is gonna stand to Sharia or whatever.
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:36.440]   And so they said, we are gonna bring in,
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:40.760]   so they hired a retired British common law judges
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:44.160]   to educate the law and train the people under there.
[03:08:44.160 --> 03:08:47.200]   And I'm oversimplifying, but at the end of the day,
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:49.760]   in a within a generation,
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:53.080]   Dubai became one of the top
[03:08:53.080 --> 03:08:55.400]   international financial centers of the world.
[03:08:55.400 --> 03:08:56.760]   It is what it is today.
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:58.920]   So-
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:00.840]   - And in the case of the African nations,
[03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:02.640]   that zone can then spread.
[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:04.760]   - Yes, it can not only spread,
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:06.400]   but maybe let's say Senegal,
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:07.640]   if Senegal was to go for this,
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:09.200]   here you have this one,
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:11.160]   and then over there you have another zone.
[03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:12.600]   And then what they start to do
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:14.560]   is they're not all modeled the same way,
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:16.000]   because maybe this one is saying,
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.200]   hey, we wanna attract more, I don't know,
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:22.360]   maybe we wanna attract more medical research, right?
[03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:23.400]   This one's gonna be saying,
[03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:26.120]   maybe we wanna attract more crypto,
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:27.680]   or maybe it's gonna be more like us,
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:30.000]   we wanna be more about religious this or whatever.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:30.840]   You know what I mean?
[03:09:30.840 --> 03:09:32.760]   So we wanted to fit more of this or that.
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:36.760]   And just kind of give the basics, the grounds,
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:40.520]   and then watch the magic happen on it, right?
[03:09:40.520 --> 03:09:43.520]   And so this is what we're working on.
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:46.080]   And the hope there, because some people are like,
[03:09:46.080 --> 03:09:47.680]   you know, I know some people are like,
[03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:50.280]   you guys are crazy, but I'm like, no,
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:55.280]   it's more or less the story of the Asian tigers.
[03:09:55.280 --> 03:09:59.680]   And most recently, most of China's progress,
[03:09:59.680 --> 03:10:01.440]   economically speaking, because some people might say,
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:05.400]   well, you don't want China, we're developing, you see.
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:10.400]   Even then I say, and it's okay, you can always do better.
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:15.680]   But we cannot deny the magic that they have accomplished.
[03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:18.440]   What they have accomplished is nothing short of a miracle.
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:20.680]   800 million people getting out of poverty
[03:10:20.680 --> 03:10:21.520]   in such a short amount of time.
[03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:23.560]   - Yeah, exactly, so it's not, yeah,
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:25.600]   for the quality of life
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:27.600]   and the majority of the Chinese population.
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:30.200]   - Yes, does something like that happen without problems?
[03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:31.720]   Of course not.
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:33.800]   And so the next person to do something
[03:10:33.800 --> 03:10:36.720]   just actually gets to learn from lessons, from lessons.
[03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:37.560]   That's all.
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:38.400]   - And leapfrog.
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:40.360]   - And leapfrog, and leapfrog, exactly.
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:41.880]   So for me, this is a promise.
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:44.240]   And people are like, oh, but you guys are crazy.
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:46.120]   But I'm like, just like with everything,
[03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:47.400]   do you know how many attempts it took
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:49.400]   before the first flight, you know,
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:50.880]   the Wright brothers took off?
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:52.640]   Do you know how many?
[03:10:52.640 --> 03:10:54.240]   And that's important.
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:56.640]   You try, you crash, you try, you crash,
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:10:59.360]   but each time you're going higher, up higher,
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:02.600]   and you want to get up for once,
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:04.040]   then you stay up longer.
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:06.680]   And before you know it, you're doing all types of things.
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:07.560]   So here's the same thing.
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:12.560]   I tell people, listen, all I need is one success story.
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.400]   And then the sea change.
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:19.440]   People don't even wait for us.
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:20.520]   Everybody.
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:24.040]   But this is hard because it's the first time.
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:26.720]   So, but the good news is there are many groups
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:28.440]   working on the continent.
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:32.440]   There are some groups in Zambia, there's a zone there,
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:34.640]   folks are doing something like this in Nigeria.
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:36.840]   We're part of a project there in Nigeria.
[03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:39.480]   The one that I'm most excited about,
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:41.480]   I cannot disclose the name of the country yet,
[03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:44.080]   but my God, I'm so excited by it.
[03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:46.240]   And I just know, I just know, Lex,
[03:11:46.240 --> 03:11:47.880]   it's going to happen in our lifetime.
[03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:48.720]   - I hope so.
[03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:50.040]   It's a really powerful vision.
[03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:52.840]   And you know, it's not being dramatic to say
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:56.560]   that the future of humanity depends on that,
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:11:59.400]   your success, that success in Africa.
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:02.120]   It's such an important continent.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:03.240]   - It is. - In this century.
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:05.640]   - It's the continent where everything started.
[03:12:05.640 --> 03:12:08.520]   And I think it's the continent where we have,
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:11.240]   that continent has to finally, finally, finally thrive.
[03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:13.480]   We cannot, all of us call ourself
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:18.440]   an enlightened society as a whole.
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:21.040]   When you have such, when you have this,
[03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:22.280]   it's a humongous continent.
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:23.720]   Have you seen the size of it?
[03:12:23.720 --> 03:12:25.720]   You know?
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:26.560]   - Yeah.
[03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:28.600]   It's hard to fathom, actually.
[03:12:28.600 --> 03:12:29.640]   - Yeah. - To forget.
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:30.480]   - Exactly.
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:32.680]   - And it has such ingenious people.
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:34.680]   You know, sometimes I look at my people.
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:36.720]   I have to tell you.
[03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:42.800]   I'm so proud of them and the young people especially.
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:45.000]   And you know, you would look at them
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:46.640]   and you know, somebody said sometimes,
[03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:48.080]   one day, and it was so true.
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:51.280]   They said, "You know, we've seen poverty other places,
[03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:56.920]   "but here, it is just, maybe somebody doesn't have money,
[03:12:56.920 --> 03:12:58.720]   "but they have dignity."
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:00.080]   And it's true.
[03:13:00.080 --> 03:13:00.920]   - Yeah.
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:03.360]   - So everything else we can handle and we will handle.
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:05.120]   You have to mark my word for this.
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:06.600]   This is gonna happen.
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:09.640]   And our youth is amazing.
[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:11.200]   You should see them.
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:13.520]   So full of creativity and it doesn't matter.
[03:13:13.520 --> 03:13:15.160]   You know, you were telling me what makes you different?
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:16.680]   Many things makes us all different.
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:18.640]   You know, the Rwandans are very different
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:21.720]   from the West Africans that we are.
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:24.560]   Rwandans, for example, never dance with their hips.
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:27.440]   They dance more like, you know, with this part of a body.
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:30.000]   - West Africans' hips?
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.240]   - Us, it's hips all over the place all the time.
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:34.640]   And it's, you know, more jumping, stuff like that.
[03:13:34.640 --> 03:13:36.360]   In Rwanda, you feel it's more like, you know,
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:39.320]   I mean, they remind me more of, you know, the ballet thing.
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:42.440]   Rwandans have a sense where, you know,
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:45.240]   they don't eat so much in public.
[03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:47.920]   It's not very well, it's something you do.
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:50.120]   Us, we are the West Africans, we like to be loud.
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:52.520]   We're almost like the Italians of the continent.
[03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:53.760]   (laughing)
[03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:55.160]   And then the Rwandans are more like, you know,
[03:13:55.160 --> 03:13:56.880]   the Swiss of activist country,
[03:13:56.880 --> 03:13:58.400]   even looks like a Switzerland.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:00.800]   I mean, we're so different from one group to another.
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:02.880]   Then you go to the Congo and you see these guys,
[03:14:02.880 --> 03:14:04.480]   they're so crazy, the way they dress, I mean,
[03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:08.520]   les sapeurs, so we are a very different bunch.
[03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:11.000]   But you know what I love about us,
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:12.400]   what I love about my people?
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:19.720]   We are the, we are the manifestation
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:21.800]   of what resiliency means.
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:26.800]   And so everything we need is there.
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:29.400]   I will say that there's nothing wrong with the seed.
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:34.400]   Everything that's wrong with us is that pot
[03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:36.720]   that we put around us.
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:38.600]   So we're tired of being bonsai people.
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:43.120]   We need to be the tallest trees in the forest
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:44.520]   that we were designed to be.
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:45.360]   And so--
[03:14:45.360 --> 03:14:46.680]   - And that can be fixed.
[03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:48.160]   - And that can be fixed, and that's the beauty of it.
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:51.720]   And that's why I am so, I'm almost dizzy with,
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:54.440]   I get dizzy with hope.
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:57.480]   I know my history, I know my economics,
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:00.680]   my fellow humans and all of that.
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:03.400]   And we know that there's an unfailing recipe.
[03:15:03.400 --> 03:15:06.240]   - Yeah.
[03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:07.360]   - And when it comes to that recipe,
[03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:09.080]   we have the hardest part of it.
[03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:13.560]   One missing ingredient, which is a free markets.
[03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:20.520]   As we go around and talk and people start to understand
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:22.960]   and each country tries to figure out,
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:25.520]   okay, where do we go there from here?
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:32.280]   I know that I will die with my continent
[03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:36.640]   having taken the right shift for a turn.
[03:15:36.640 --> 03:15:37.880]   I don't have to see where it ends
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:40.000]   because I cannot in my wildest dream
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:41.760]   imagine where it's gonna end.
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:45.200]   But I know it's gonna be, yeah.
[03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:49.800]   So all my only job is to make sure
[03:15:49.800 --> 03:15:54.800]   that the right thing is done, is to get this message out.
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:58.400]   And then let my people do with it what they wanna do.
[03:15:58.400 --> 03:16:01.400]   - Yeah, the scale of impact is just boundless.
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:02.880]   It's kinda cool, I mean, you know,
[03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:04.760]   sometimes we think about individual problems,
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:05.680]   and how do we solve them?
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:09.000]   We look up to certain individuals like the, I don't know,
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:13.400]   Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, but it's so much more powerful
[03:16:13.400 --> 03:16:17.160]   to just, without knowing what they will do,
[03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:22.160]   to millions, to hundreds of millions of people
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:23.840]   to do whatever the hell they're gonna do.
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:25.200]   - Can you imagine?
[03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:26.480]   Can you just imagine?
[03:16:26.480 --> 03:16:27.720]   - It's truly, truly exciting.
[03:16:27.720 --> 03:16:30.160]   So in that sense, the work you're doing,
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:33.560]   it's unimaginable the kind of impact it would have.
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:36.160]   Now, going back to that hard moment,
[03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:38.920]   this dark place you went in, in your mind,
[03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:41.880]   in your personal life story, you lost your husband.
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:45.360]   What gave you strength during that time?
[03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:49.080]   What were the places you went to your mind
[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:52.800]   in terms of personal struggle,
[03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:54.720]   in terms of maybe even depression,
[03:16:54.720 --> 03:16:57.960]   or these kinds of struggles?
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:01.280]   - I think for me, when my husband passed away,
[03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:06.240]   I went to,
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:10.040]   maybe my friends could see what was going on,
[03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:11.840]   maybe they couldn't, I don't know.
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:14.480]   But on the surface, I looked like I was fine.
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:16.280]   But what happened is, the only thing I think
[03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:18.720]   that kept me around as I thought about it,
[03:17:18.720 --> 03:17:24.280]   was the job to be done.
[03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:28.160]   These women relied on me.
[03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:31.320]   And I was no longer free.
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:32.440]   I did not own myself.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:33.480]   And they said it in those words,
[03:17:33.480 --> 03:17:35.040]   you don't own yourself anymore.
[03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:38.040]   And it was true.
[03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:41.440]   But it helped me because I was able to,
[03:17:43.520 --> 03:17:45.880]   you know, sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around,
[03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:47.120]   whatever it takes.
[03:17:47.120 --> 03:17:48.280]   And that's what I would tell people
[03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:51.840]   who feel like they can't just push one more push,
[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:54.120]   and they think they need to end it.
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:55.800]   At that point, whatever it takes,
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:17:58.000]   just stick around for one more second
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.520]   because the next second, you know.
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:04.200]   So I stuck around because of duty.
[03:18:04.200 --> 03:18:06.320]   I felt a very strong sense of duty.
[03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:10.400]   My duty was in this case, I think, stronger than my pain.
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:11.400]   I don't know if it's possible,
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:13.760]   I don't know how that was possible, but it was.
[03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:20.200]   And I just pushed my grief under the rug for years.
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:22.800]   For years, I worked like a mad lady.
[03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:28.080]   I would travel, I would do three states in three days,
[03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:29.840]   landing at two in the morning,
[03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:31.880]   around five or six, going to ride along
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:34.400]   with our distributors, 'cause it was beverage,
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:36.560]   and just keep going and have all of this energy
[03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:38.440]   and look like everything is fine.
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:39.760]   But what happened was just like,
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:41.440]   I was focused on the job to be done.
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:43.760]   And sometimes it is okay to do that.
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:46.840]   At least for me, it was my safety.
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:47.920]   You know, like when you're in the water
[03:18:47.920 --> 03:18:51.360]   and you're about to sink and they throw you that round thing,
[03:18:51.360 --> 03:18:52.800]   I don't know how you call it.
[03:18:52.800 --> 03:18:56.200]   - The thing that keeps you afloat, you mean?
[03:18:56.200 --> 03:18:57.280]   - Yes, yes, the floater.
[03:18:57.280 --> 03:18:59.040]   It's the floater. - Yeah, whatever.
[03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:02.040]   Between the two of us, we're still terrible.
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:02.880]   - We're bad.
[03:19:02.880 --> 03:19:05.040]   So listen, you, you, you.
[03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:06.320]   - I know exactly what you mean.
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:07.160]   - Exactly, right?
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:08.200]   So you understand me.
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:10.600]   So they send you that thing and you just,
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:12.600]   I was just hanging on to it.
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:14.480]   My life depended on this thing.
[03:19:14.480 --> 03:19:17.520]   So these women, they carried me.
[03:19:17.520 --> 03:19:19.280]   They carried me.
[03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:23.560]   And with time, things are moving forward.
[03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:26.880]   And at some point I went into really, really deep depression
[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:29.640]   and I went into a very dark place,
[03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:31.840]   even darker than the one I think I came from.
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:35.200]   Because by that time, I had worked for years
[03:19:35.200 --> 03:19:37.960]   on this company and now some other things was happening.
[03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:42.160]   And around that time, it's also when I was discovering
[03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:45.160]   a lot of what we talked about today,
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:48.000]   about what makes a country rich.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:52.840]   And for me to understand that my network,
[03:19:52.840 --> 03:19:56.280]   I was very much into left-oriented network.
[03:19:56.280 --> 03:20:02.320]   And to just start to see all of this,
[03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:06.720]   I tried to address it to realize that many of these people
[03:20:06.720 --> 03:20:09.080]   would prefer go running for the hills
[03:20:09.080 --> 03:20:12.960]   than accept for a moment that maybe capitalism
[03:20:12.960 --> 03:20:14.760]   might be part of a solution,
[03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:17.280]   when many of them were involved in capitalism.
[03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:21.320]   So that was a hard time.
[03:20:21.320 --> 03:20:26.560]   At some point I was, yeah, so many things were happening
[03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:31.560]   around that time that basically shook up everything for me.
[03:20:31.560 --> 03:20:35.640]   One is hard to talk about because it's very personal
[03:20:35.640 --> 03:20:39.560]   and the person that I was having a problem with
[03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:41.760]   passed away last year.
[03:20:41.760 --> 03:20:45.840]   And I'm one to always say, leave the dead alone.
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:48.760]   So because of that, I won't speak about it.
[03:20:48.760 --> 03:20:51.080]   But there too, having a major fallout
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:53.560]   with somebody who was like a father figure for me,
[03:20:53.560 --> 03:20:55.800]   somebody that I completely trusted.
[03:20:55.800 --> 03:20:59.320]   And so at some point you just ask yourself,
[03:20:59.320 --> 03:21:01.120]   was my whole life built on a lie?
[03:21:01.120 --> 03:21:04.920]   Right?
[03:21:04.920 --> 03:21:08.920]   And then you're confused and then you become confused.
[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:13.160]   And then at some point you lose 90% of your friends
[03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:16.160]   because of ideologically speaking, it doesn't work anymore.
[03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:24.200]   Then you just wonder, have I been asleep this whole time?
[03:21:24.200 --> 03:21:26.320]   And then you start to wonder,
[03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:28.080]   remember when you asked me, who am I?
[03:21:28.080 --> 03:21:29.880]   At some point Lex,
[03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:32.160]   I literally was like a candle in the wind.
[03:21:33.720 --> 03:21:35.680]   I felt like I was a candle in the wind.
[03:21:35.680 --> 03:21:38.960]   And it was very hard to come back from that.
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:42.080]   And people have a hard time,
[03:21:42.080 --> 03:21:43.920]   the few people I talk to about this,
[03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:45.560]   they have a hardest time understanding
[03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:48.160]   or even believing it because they're like, you?
[03:21:48.160 --> 03:21:50.040]   I'm like, yes, me.
[03:21:50.040 --> 03:21:52.320]   I used to be a candle in the wind.
[03:21:52.320 --> 03:21:53.720]   - What got you out?
[03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:55.480]   What made you overcome that?
[03:21:55.480 --> 03:21:58.480]   - My current husband, my current husband.
[03:21:58.480 --> 03:21:59.320]   - Love?
[03:21:59.320 --> 03:22:00.160]   - Love.
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:02.040]   See, when I tell you love is the answer.
[03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:04.360]   But him, he came with love,
[03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:08.840]   but he also came with really helping me
[03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:10.240]   figure out the world.
[03:22:10.240 --> 03:22:11.920]   So with Michael, because that's him,
[03:22:11.920 --> 03:22:13.920]   who we're talking about, Michael Strong.
[03:22:13.920 --> 03:22:16.480]   - That must be special.
[03:22:16.480 --> 03:22:17.720]   - He's so special.
[03:22:17.720 --> 03:22:18.960]   He's so special.
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:21.480]   So you have no idea how special he is.
[03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:25.040]   But you know, Michael, the reason why I have such love,
[03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:26.920]   respect and admiration for my husband,
[03:22:26.920 --> 03:22:28.600]   I'll never say it enough,
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:32.360]   is because actually it's one of those relationships
[03:22:32.360 --> 03:22:37.360]   that got built based on intellect first.
[03:22:37.360 --> 03:22:41.360]   You see, at some point I was in the position
[03:22:41.360 --> 03:22:43.560]   where I could start a foundation
[03:22:43.560 --> 03:22:46.880]   after having built my first business.
[03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:51.880]   And all I wanted was an ability to power
[03:22:54.320 --> 03:22:59.040]   as many, especially women, African women entrepreneurs,
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:01.760]   like me a few years ago, before then,
[03:23:01.760 --> 03:23:04.560]   to do something like I was able to do.
[03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:07.400]   Bring back to the world some really cool aspects
[03:23:07.400 --> 03:23:10.160]   of our culture built into a really cool brand,
[03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:11.760]   21st century type.
[03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:12.840]   That's what I wanted to do.
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:15.640]   Because the more I could promote women like that
[03:23:15.640 --> 03:23:17.480]   and put steam behind them,
[03:23:17.480 --> 03:23:21.080]   and the more my dream and vision for a respected Africa,
[03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:22.520]   prosperous Africa would happen.
[03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:24.680]   Back then, that's what I wanted.
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:29.000]   And around me, this was also part of the whole crisis
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:32.000]   of ideologies I had back then.
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:36.480]   Everybody was like, "Well, we should be just doing grants."
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:40.680]   And I knew that my people didn't need grants.
[03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:42.280]   They didn't need like a handout.
[03:23:42.280 --> 03:23:46.080]   They don't want your charity.
[03:23:46.080 --> 03:23:47.680]   I didn't want charity.
[03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:51.040]   I wanted someone who could work with me on my accounting.
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:54.560]   I wanted somebody who could help me brainstorm
[03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:55.840]   marketing-wise.
[03:23:55.840 --> 03:23:59.400]   I wanted somebody, or I needed to raise money
[03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:03.320]   to pay my research and development guy
[03:24:03.320 --> 03:24:08.000]   to help me take the juices from my grandma's recipe
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.640]   to something that can be shelf-stable.
[03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:15.240]   I needed coaching.
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:17.440]   These are all the things that I needed
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:18.840]   to make my dream happen.
[03:24:18.840 --> 03:24:20.960]   I didn't want you to give me some crap for free,
[03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:21.920]   that's not what I want.
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:24.840]   I just want to be able to build my business
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:27.280]   with all the things that business building needs.
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:30.440]   And so that's what I wanted to do,
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:32.120]   and it's what was needed.
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:36.400]   And so Michael, somebody found out about what I was doing,
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:37.760]   because back in the days of the school,
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:39.480]   they would write a lot about me and everything.
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:43.640]   And so Michael, along with John Mackey,
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:44.920]   the founder of Whole Foods Market,
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:48.040]   they had a nonprofit called Flow,
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:49.880]   and it's all about human flourishing.
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:52.640]   They want for people, everybody to get this choice,
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:55.080]   this ability to be able to get to a point in their life
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:24:56.880]   where they're in complete flow.
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:24:59.040]   It's, Michael, just make hi,
[03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:00.880]   Michael is the only one who can say that last name,
[03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:02.400]   but the whole concept of flow,
[03:25:02.400 --> 03:25:03.480]   when you're in a state of flow,
[03:25:03.480 --> 03:25:06.400]   you're basically doing what you're supposed to do,
[03:25:06.400 --> 03:25:07.400]   the way you're supposed to do it,
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:08.360]   with the people you're supposed to,
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:10.840]   this whole concept of flow, it's amazing,
[03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:12.840]   it's human flourishing at its highest.
[03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:16.880]   So I met with this man, Max, you're so,
[03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:21.520]   okay, so we, he finds me, his people find me.
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:23.200]   And then there was a program
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:26.360]   where it was all about accelerating women entrepreneurs.
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:28.120]   So it's during this times
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:30.400]   that I'm starting now to see things.
[03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:33.520]   That's when actually all of this stuff that I noticed,
[03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:35.760]   how come here it takes me all of this time
[03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:37.440]   to start my business, over there's 20 minutes,
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:39.480]   here it's free, over there's thousands of dollars,
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:41.080]   all of this nonsense that I just took,
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:42.400]   oh, maybe it's just because we're messed up,
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:45.360]   we're poor, that's why everything is so messed up.
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:48.000]   Whoa, these people are introducing me to concepts,
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:50.800]   I'm like, first of all, I'm like, oh, really?
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:55.200]   What did you call the doing business?
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:25:56.040]   What is that?
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:25:58.880]   All of this stuff.
[03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:02.000]   And I'm starting to discover this whole other body of work,
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:06.920]   what the free market's like, this thing that I was sensing,
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:08.280]   this environment that I was sensing
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:11.000]   that it was different around me,
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.880]   and that they called it the free markets over here,
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:15.680]   and over there that.
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:18.480]   And then I started to butthead those ideas
[03:26:18.480 --> 03:26:21.800]   with the ideas that I was fed with before that.
[03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:23.840]   And the evidence won.
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:25.680]   And further, more than the evidence,
[03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:29.360]   the evidence combined with my lived experience,
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:30.720]   it was so powerful.
[03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:34.080]   So I basically started understanding these ideas
[03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:37.880]   from the most visceral part of my body, of my being.
[03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:41.080]   And it made sense.
[03:26:41.080 --> 03:26:45.440]   So Michael, Michael helped me find the solution,
[03:26:45.440 --> 03:26:49.920]   the answer to my lifelong little girl's question
[03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:52.280]   of why do we have this and we don't?
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:55.600]   And how do some countries like mine be poor
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:57.560]   while others are rich?
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:01.560]   And with understanding all of that,
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:07.480]   the greatest, biggest sense of liberation came upon me.
[03:27:09.280 --> 03:27:12.440]   Like, I have no other word to describe that.
[03:27:12.440 --> 03:27:16.880]   True liberation, the liberation that comes from a peer,
[03:27:16.880 --> 03:27:21.880]   to finally understand and be vindicated
[03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:25.320]   in your own, you know,
[03:27:25.320 --> 03:27:30.320]   understand, in your own deep knowing or feeling that
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:33.680]   they're not, what they're saying is not true.
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:35.160]   You're not the problem.
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:36.680]   It's not you.
[03:27:36.680 --> 03:27:38.640]   There's something else.
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:41.320]   And when I discovered that, my whole life changed.
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:44.800]   So, and since then, I have been very serious
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:46.680]   about going deeper and deeper and deeper
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:49.840]   into my understanding of all of this,
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:52.040]   understanding the subtlety.
[03:27:52.040 --> 03:27:53.920]   At some point I was very angry
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:55.720]   about the liberators of Africa,
[03:27:55.720 --> 03:27:58.400]   'cause I was like, yes, you helped liberate us,
[03:27:58.400 --> 03:28:00.280]   but just to keep us in this marism,
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:03.360]   I was angry for the longest time.
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:07.920]   And then eventually you have to engage empathy and love.
[03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:10.160]   To put yourself in their shoes
[03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:13.280]   and try to understand the time at which they were living.
[03:28:13.280 --> 03:28:14.560]   And that got me onto a journey
[03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:17.120]   of trying to understand history more.
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:19.360]   That's how I understood I was able to go beyond
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:22.000]   just these liberators and try to understand
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:23.600]   and rebuild the world around them,
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:28.600]   at the micro and also at the macro level.
[03:28:28.600 --> 03:28:31.760]   Just really, you have to try to walk in their shoes.
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:36.800]   And from there, finally separate the baby with a bathwater
[03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:38.680]   that they were not able to do back then.
[03:28:38.680 --> 03:28:40.680]   That's why today, I'm sorry,
[03:28:40.680 --> 03:28:44.760]   but I have no patience for the BLM organizers, founders,
[03:28:44.760 --> 03:28:45.600]   especially the founders.
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:46.440]   I don't know what the organizers think,
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:48.800]   but the founders told us what they stand for.
[03:28:48.800 --> 03:28:51.840]   And I say, guys, don't make that same mistake again.
[03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:53.080]   If you're serious about this,
[03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:54.720]   you cannot make the same mistake.
[03:28:54.720 --> 03:29:00.280]   The liberators of Africa, they have an excuse.
[03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:01.120]   We didn't know better.
[03:29:01.120 --> 03:29:04.960]   It was so easy back then to conflate everything.
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:08.360]   But today, you, me, anybody alive,
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:12.520]   cannot with a straight face embrace Marxist socialist ideas,
[03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:16.440]   especially, especially when they're claiming
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:20.360]   that they want people to thrive.
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:22.480]   No, you can't, I'm sorry.
[03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:26.080]   And I will hold your feet up to the fire on that one.
[03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:27.040]   I will, I will.
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:28.080]   And that's what I'm doing.
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:29.200]   They will give me a lot of grief for this,
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:30.040]   but guess what?
[03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:30.880]   I could care less.
[03:29:30.880 --> 03:29:32.480]   Do you know why I could care less?
[03:29:32.480 --> 03:29:36.800]   Because we have an entire population to help rise
[03:29:36.800 --> 03:29:40.360]   out of poverty into prosperity,
[03:29:40.360 --> 03:29:44.520]   where they become co-creators,
[03:29:44.520 --> 03:29:47.320]   global co-creators of innovation.
[03:29:47.320 --> 03:29:52.440]   - And those ideas give you hope for the place you love,
[03:29:52.440 --> 03:29:54.320]   for Senegal, for Africa.
[03:29:54.320 --> 03:29:55.600]   - They do, they do.
[03:29:55.600 --> 03:29:57.240]   I live, the world I live in,
[03:29:57.240 --> 03:30:02.440]   the new centers of culture and fashion are in Dakar.
[03:30:02.440 --> 03:30:03.280]   (Lex laughing)
[03:30:03.280 --> 03:30:08.280]   The new centers of tech and crypto even
[03:30:08.280 --> 03:30:13.600]   is somewhere, maybe Nigeria.
[03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:16.440]   - So you see that future, you see that future clearly.
[03:30:16.440 --> 03:30:18.960]   - I do, I do, I do.
[03:30:18.960 --> 03:30:20.080]   - It's a beautiful thing.
[03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:22.560]   And it's also beautiful to see that the space
[03:30:22.560 --> 03:30:24.920]   of these really powerful ideas
[03:30:24.920 --> 03:30:26.720]   is where you also found love.
[03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:27.560]   - Right?
[03:30:27.560 --> 03:30:28.800]   - So at the intersection.
[03:30:28.800 --> 03:30:31.880]   - At the intersection, Michael and I would spend hours
[03:30:31.880 --> 03:30:33.160]   talking about all of these ideas.
[03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:34.680]   And I would be like, "But what about this?
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:36.000]   "No, it doesn't make any sense.
[03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:37.240]   "No, no, no, oh no."
[03:30:37.240 --> 03:30:41.600]   And then hours, every single day for months, Lex.
[03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:42.480]   - Yeah.
[03:30:42.480 --> 03:30:45.040]   - And then from there, our love was born.
[03:30:45.040 --> 03:30:47.320]   'Cause I tell people, for us,
[03:30:47.320 --> 03:30:49.120]   love is not about looking each other in the eyes,
[03:30:49.120 --> 03:30:51.400]   like we all think, but it's about,
[03:30:51.400 --> 03:30:53.120]   we look in one direction, and in this case,
[03:30:53.120 --> 03:30:55.920]   it's this vision, what we know to be possible and true.
[03:30:55.920 --> 03:30:58.440]   If only you liberate people,
[03:30:59.600 --> 03:31:01.480]   what we know to be true and possible.
[03:31:01.480 --> 03:31:04.880]   All of us are miracles walking around.
[03:31:04.880 --> 03:31:08.600]   Every time I get on a plane, it's a miracle of engineering.
[03:31:08.600 --> 03:31:11.560]   All the things we're able to do now
[03:31:11.560 --> 03:31:13.360]   when they do operation on your teeth,
[03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:16.680]   how they're able to put the pain down away.
[03:31:16.680 --> 03:31:18.000]   All of this is us.
[03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:19.560]   You're working on these robots.
[03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:22.520]   This, this, this inside here.
[03:31:22.520 --> 03:31:23.840]   - Yeah, humans are amazing.
[03:31:23.840 --> 03:31:24.760]   - I know.
[03:31:24.760 --> 03:31:27.200]   So that's why, and when it works in great tandem
[03:31:27.200 --> 03:31:30.360]   with this guy, these two working together.
[03:31:30.360 --> 03:31:31.200]   - Yeah.
[03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:32.040]   - Ooh, watch out.
[03:31:32.040 --> 03:31:33.280]   - There's nothing we can't accomplish.
[03:31:33.280 --> 03:31:35.160]   - Nothing, nothing.
[03:31:35.160 --> 03:31:37.720]   - Well, Guy, you're one of the most incredible people
[03:31:37.720 --> 03:31:38.560]   I've ever talked to, I've ever met.
[03:31:38.560 --> 03:31:39.760]   - Oh, you say that.
[03:31:39.760 --> 03:31:41.200]   You've met everybody.
[03:31:41.200 --> 03:31:42.040]   - Thank you so much.
[03:31:42.040 --> 03:31:43.520]   This is truly an honor.
[03:31:43.520 --> 03:31:44.600]   Thank you for everything you're doing.
[03:31:44.600 --> 03:31:46.840]   Thank you for the fire that burns within you.
[03:31:46.840 --> 03:31:49.080]   And it's just the passion you have for a place
[03:31:49.080 --> 03:31:52.000]   that's going to, I think, define the future of humanity.
[03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:53.320]   So thank you for everything you're doing.
[03:31:53.320 --> 03:31:54.160]   Thank you for talking today.
[03:31:54.160 --> 03:31:55.320]   - Thank you, thank you to you.
[03:31:55.320 --> 03:31:57.720]   And sometimes I hope this fire doesn't consume me.
[03:31:57.720 --> 03:31:59.240]   That's how much it is.
[03:31:59.240 --> 03:32:02.320]   But I am grateful to you for this.
[03:32:02.320 --> 03:32:04.640]   And yeah, thank you for,
[03:32:04.640 --> 03:32:06.600]   I know you don't do a lot of these, you know,
[03:32:06.600 --> 03:32:09.560]   I am, it's, this type of interviews, maybe, I don't know.
[03:32:09.560 --> 03:32:11.640]   But I'm so, so happy to be here.
[03:32:11.640 --> 03:32:14.960]   - You mean fun, inspiring, powerful interviews?
[03:32:14.960 --> 03:32:16.400]   Yes, I need to do more.
[03:32:16.400 --> 03:32:17.240]   You're amazing.
[03:32:17.240 --> 03:32:18.600]   - I don't know, because at first I was like,
[03:32:18.600 --> 03:32:20.040]   Lex Friedman, really?
[03:32:20.040 --> 03:32:20.880]   - Yeah, really?
[03:32:20.880 --> 03:32:21.920]   How's this going to go?
[03:32:21.920 --> 03:32:23.680]   - I'm like, yeah, I'm going to talk to Lex
[03:32:23.680 --> 03:32:24.520]   and go all crazy.
[03:32:24.520 --> 03:32:27.680]   - I think you need to work on your unconscious bias.
[03:32:27.680 --> 03:32:29.840]   - Right! (laughs)
[03:32:29.840 --> 03:32:30.680]   Okay, fine. - All right, thank you,
[03:32:30.680 --> 03:32:31.520]   Magat, you're the best.
[03:32:31.520 --> 03:32:33.520]   - Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
[03:32:33.520 --> 03:32:36.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:32:36.200 --> 03:32:37.520]   with Magat Wade.
[03:32:37.520 --> 03:32:38.760]   To support this podcast,

[03:32:41.360 --> 03:32:43.560]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:32:43.560 --> 03:32:44.900]   from Nelson Mandela.
[03:32:44.900 --> 03:32:48.460]   Money won't create success.
[03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:51.000]   The freedom to make it will.
[03:32:52.160 --> 03:32:55.240]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:32:55.240 --> 03:32:57.820]   (upbeat music)
[03:32:57.820 --> 03:33:00.400]   (upbeat music)
