[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   We return once more to our consideration of the fourth verse in the seventh chapter of
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.720]   Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:21.480]   Now, I have been indicating the last few Friday evenings that this is one of these great crucial
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.640]   verses in which the apostle seems to summarize the whole of the Christian faith. He has described
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   it to us as being an entirely new life. We are dead to one, we are born to another. It
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.120]   is an entire change of relationship. It gives us an entirely new motive and it provides
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.760]   us with an entirely new strength. But it doesn't really tell us like that what the Christian
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.680]   life is. It tells us how we enter into it and what makes it possible for us ever to
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.440]   enjoy such a life.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.240]   The first thing you remember was this. Certain things had to happen to our Lord. He had to
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.480]   come into this world in a body. He had to die. He had to rise again. There never would
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.520]   have been any Christianity apart from that. There would be no such thing as Christian
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.840]   blessing if he had not done and endured all that. But as we began to see last Friday night,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.740]   it is not enough even that he should have done all that. Certain things must also happen
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.860]   to us. And we are considering them at the moment. One is that we needs must be united
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.780]   to him. Because, as is made plain here, we became dead to the law by the body of Christ
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.720]   because we were united to him, baptized, if you like, into his death.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.280]   Then the second thing was that we had to die to the law. And the third thing is, and the
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.840]   second was necessary because of the third, we have to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.760]   Wherefore, my brethren, you also became dead to the Lord by the body of Christ that, in
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.440]   order that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.940]   we should bring forth fruit unto God. Now then, this is our theme at the moment.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.200]   We are married to the Lord Jesus Christ. And there are certain things which we have to
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.040]   say about this union. I have described them as the consequences of the union. And the
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.600]   first which we dealt with last time was the nature of the union. And there the thing I
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.440]   emphasized was that we are made one flesh with him. The twain shall be made one flesh,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.120]   says the apostle in writing to the Ephesians. He says this is a great mystery, but I speak
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   concerning Christ and the Church. In a mysterious manner, we are made one flesh with the Lord
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.160]   Jesus Christ and are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. And it is
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.680]   an indissoluble union. Very well, that enables us now then to go on.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.040]   The next thing that I would note about the consequences of the union is what we may put
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.160]   under a general heading and call the privileges of the union. Now this is one of the most
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.640]   marvelous and wonderful things that is ever said about the Christian, that we are married
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.880]   to the Lord Jesus Christ. The very nature of the union makes it one of the most exalted
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.680]   comparisons that even this great apostle ever used. And I assert that there is nothing that
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:12.000]   is so strengthening to faith, nothing so comforting, and especially nothing so stimulating to sanctification
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.880]   as to realize this particular truth. You remember our Lord in the great high priestly prayer
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.480]   in John 17 says, "Thy word is truth. Sanctify them," is his petition, "sanctify them through
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:35.600]   thy truth." Then, "Thy word is truth." The way we are sanctified is through the truth,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.560]   through the word. There is no word, I say, that is so stimulating to sanctification as
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.640]   this particular description of the Christian as one who is wedded, married to the Lord
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.520]   Jesus Christ. Let us therefore, for our mutual encouragement
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.280]   and strengthening and help, consider some of the privileges that become ours as Christians.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   Every one of us who is a Christian is married to Christ. You cannot be a Christian without
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.960]   being in that position. We are never detached. We are either married to the Lord or else
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.160]   married to him. We are in one of the two positions. Therefore, I say, these are privileges which
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:30.560]   are true of all who are Christian. The first, obviously, is this. His name becomes our name.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.360]   When a woman marries a man, she gives up her own name. She takes on the name of her husband.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.240]   It is one of the most obvious things about marriage, isn't it? Well, it is the Apostle's
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.720]   illustration, not mine. This, he says, is the position of the Christian. The first thing
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   that is true of us is that his name becomes our name. It is upon us. We, indeed, are called
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   Christians. That means his name is on us. Christ's people, Christians, people belonging
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.120]   to him who changed their name. As that forty-fifth Psalm has put it, "We have left our home,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.940]   left our parents, and we have become joined to him." The old name no longer applies
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:29.200]   to us. His name is upon us. This, of course, is an idea in and of itself that battles description
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:36.080]   and is impossible to handle adequately because we are told about his name that it is a name
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.480]   which is above every other name. There is no name in heaven or earth which is comparable
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.600]   to this. At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow. Of things in heaven and things
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:59.840]   on earth and things under the earth. And this, you see, becomes our name. There is no greater
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.960]   title, there is no greater dignity that can ever come to a human being than this. Are
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.280]   you interested in honors? Are you interested in titles? Are you interested in names? Well,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.800]   here is the name, the name that is above every other name. And because we are married to
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   Christ, it is our name. His name is upon us and it covers us. Is there anything on earth
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.920]   comparable to being a Christian, I ask? And that is why I am constrained to add, "Shame
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.360]   upon us Christian people," forever being apologetic, forever being afraid that people
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.080]   should know that we are Christians, forever feeling that we are having a hard time. All
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.120]   our troubles, you see, emanate from the fact that we fail to realize our position and our
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   privileges. There is a sense in which we should be the proudest people in the world. I say
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.160]   a sense because the Christian isn't proud, but he ought to be proud of the name, he ought
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   to be proud of his position. The apostle tells us to "Glory in the Lord, him that glorieth,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.720]   let him glory in the Lord." He means, "Let him make his boast." That is the meaning of
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.040]   the word he used, "Let him make his boast in the Lord." And as you notice, people in
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.720]   the world, they are proud of the name, proud of the family name, proud of the title, proud
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:37.240]   of the dignity. So you and I should be children of the heavenly King as he journeys sweetly
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:45.320]   singing. Let us walk through this world, let us march through it as realizing the dignity
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:53.440]   and the privilege and the magnificence and the glory of the name that is upon us. That
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.360]   is the first thing. But let me hurry on. Oh, well, before I do that, perhaps let us offer
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.560]   the petition, if we're not clear about this. Let us join with him who sang, "Write thy
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:13.360]   new name upon my heart, thy new best name of love." But it's upon us. What the man
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.680]   was asking for there was that he might see it clearly, that he might be fully conscious
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.320]   of it. It's happened. It's happened as a legal transaction. We emphasized that last
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.080]   week. This is not merely a matter of experience. Experience is the realization of it. But the
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.320]   thing has happened. God has done this thing in a legal way. There has been a true union
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.120]   and the documents have been signed. And there is no power in heaven or earth who can query
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:47.240]   the marriage or ever dissolve it. None. Very well, then. I say let us realize it. Let us
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.800]   walk through the world as ever remembering it.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.280]   But then that brings me to the second thing. Not only do we have his name, but we have,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:04.780]   as it were, his standing. What I mean by that is what this apostle tells the Corinthians
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:12.080]   in the first chapter of his first epistle, in verse 30, where he says, "But of him are
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:21.920]   ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:30.840]   and redemption." Now this is a tremendous and a staggering thing. It is his righteousness
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.520]   that is put upon us. That is the whole teaching concerning justification by faith, which we
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   have considered so frequently in the early chapters of this epistle. But let us remember
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:49.560]   that this is how it comes to us. Because we are married to him, very well, his wisdom,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:58.320]   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We are complete in him. Now, it is his robe
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.360]   of righteousness that is put upon us. It is not our righteousness. It is his righteousness
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:10.120]   that is imputed to us and gradually imparted to us, that sanctification. But there it is,
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.480]   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:23.080]   Now, here is the most practical matter, as you can see. The devil will come as he does
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:29.760]   come and point to us our unworthiness and our failure and our sin. He will make us look
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:37.280]   in and he will depress us. He does often do it, doesn't he, alas, because of our folly
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:44.960]   and our ignorance. And there is only one way to counteract it. And that is, I say, to realize
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:55.160]   that because we are married to Christ, that this standing of his is put upon us. And we
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:02.280]   stand in the presence of God clothed with his righteousness. It is in him. He has been
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:10.600]   made of God and to us these things. So that now we stand in this way, not looking at ourselves,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.960]   but at him and what God has made him to be for us.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:25.400]   Here, you see, is the cure, the antidote for every depression in the spiritual life, the
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:33.120]   realization that it is our relationship to him that enables us to stand in this way in
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.840]   which God means us to stand. But then I hurry on to something else, which is this, that
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:47.960]   we share also and enjoy his privileges. This is what happens to a wife, isn't it? She
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.100]   becomes, as it were, a part of her husband. And any privileges that the husband enjoys,
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:59.240]   she enjoys. She enjoys them because she is now his wife, has become one with him, and
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.960]   all the privileges which are open to him become open to her also. Now that is the teaching
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.560]   here. And we must never forget it. What does this mean? What are some of these
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.200]   privileges? Well, here is one. The apostle reminds us in writing to the Ephesians in
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:25.960]   the second chapter, that we are at this moment seated with Christ in the heavenly places.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.320]   He doesn't stop at saying that we've been quickened together with Christ, or that we
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.300]   have been raised together with Christ. No, he goes on to say, seated in the heavenly
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:42.840]   places in Christ Jesus, in exactly the same way. And this is something again that we should
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.360]   never lose sight of, that we have this glorious privilege even here and now. This isn't
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:55.560]   something future. Because of our relationship to him, we are already seated with him in
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:02.240]   the heavenly places. Which made Augustus Toplady say this, "More happy, but not more secure,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.480]   the glorified spirits in heaven." Very well, there is one thing. But here is another wonderful
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:18.160]   thing. Because of our relationship to him, we enjoy this privilege. We have access to
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:31.200]   his Father. We have access to the Father because we are the bride of the Son. There is no greater
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:38.760]   privilege than this, having a right of entry and of access into the presence of the Father.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:47.280]   And that is what the Scripture teaches us. We are accepted in the Beloved. Work this
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.760]   out for yourselves. Think it out. Use your imaginations. Think of this in practice, in
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:59.360]   human life, and as we know it so well. And especially if this Father seems to be some
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   very great and dignified and august person, in whose presence we would normally feel very
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.920]   nervous and hesitate to ask for an interview, and hesitate still more to put a request or
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:20.480]   to ask for some favor. But if you happen to be the bride, the wife, of the only begotten
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:29.160]   Son and the dearly beloved Son of the Father, you can always be assured that there is nothing
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.240]   that he will ever refuse you that is for your good. He will refuse you things that are harmful
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.760]   for you because he loves you, because you are the bride of his Son. But he will never
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   refuse you anything for your good. Go in with confidence, accepted in the Beloved, right
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.640]   of entry and of access to the Father because of the relationship to the Son.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.560]   And then another, to me, very wonderful thing, a thing we all, I'm afraid, tend to forget,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.680]   is this. Here is a wonderful privilege that every Christian should know something about
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   and enjoy, the service of the angel. Have you noticed as you've been reading through
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.640]   your Gospels, how at given points and at given times, angels came and ministered to our Lord
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:25.280]   and strengthened him and helped him? Well now I say that because we are married to him,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.480]   this is equally true of us, but you needn't take my word for it. It isn't my deduction,
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.600]   we've got it explicitly in the epistle to the Hebrews in the first chapter. Listen to
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.880]   this, in verse 13, "But to which of the angels said he at any time, 'Sit on my right hand
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.560]   until I make thine enemies thy footstool?'" He never said that to an angel, says this
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.920]   man, he only said that to the Son. He hasn't said that to angels. Why? Well, are they not
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:17:01.480]   all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be the heirs of salvation?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:08.360]   That's every one of us who's a Christian. The angels are sent forth to minister to them
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:17.160]   who shall be heirs of salvation. Indeed our Lord had said it himself in Matthew 18, he
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:23.200]   said, "In heaven there are angels to behold the face of my Father which is in heaven."
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:29.360]   And we have the great comfort of Luke 16, the parable of Diocese and Lazarus of knowing
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:37.480]   this, that we shall be carried by angels to Abram's bosom. Here, my friend, is a privilege
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.960]   that you enjoy because you're a Christian. The angels of God are at your service. They
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:50.960]   are ministering spirits sent forth by God to serve and to minister to you and to me.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.360]   We are unconscious of this, but they're doing it though we don't realize it. We are surrounded
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:04.440]   by them. They're unseen, but they're there. They minister to us because we belong to him,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:13.320]   because we are married to him and are thereby the heirs of salvation. We don't make enough
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:20.840]   of the service of the angels, but if ever you feel lonely and bereft and feel that you
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:28.240]   don't know what to do nor where to turn, remind yourself that your heavenly Father,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:36.480]   the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, has sent angels to minister to you as he did to him
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:43.800]   in the hours of his greatest crises and his greatest agony. And then the next thing under
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:51.440]   this privilege I would note would be this, that the day is coming when we shall reign
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:58.960]   with him. It's almost incredible, isn't it? Here in this world, as Christians, if we are
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.040]   worthy of the name, we are generally despised and derided and take no notice of. The world
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.880]   passes us by as if we were nobody at all, and it talks about its great privileges and
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:16.880]   its dignities and its honors and its positions and its pomp. But we are the people who know
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.640]   something about privileges and dignities. Listen to the apostle in 1 Corinthians 6 verses
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:29.440]   2 and 3, "Do you not know," he says, "that the saints shall judge the world?" That's
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.840]   verse 2, but in verse 3 he goes further, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?" You
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.400]   and I, Christian people, why are we going to have this privilege? Well, it is because
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:49.680]   of our relationship to the Son, because we are married to the Son. We shall reign with
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:58.320]   him and judge the world and judge even the angels. We are lifted to a position entirely
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:07.480]   above even that occupied by the angels because of our relationship to the Son. Well, there
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.640]   are some of the privileges, there are many others. I must hasten on. Let us come and
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:18.080]   have a look at the possessions which are ours because we are married to him. And here again
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   the apostle, of course, puts it in many, many places. Here is one, I think, which sums it
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   all up very well. "All things are yours." You can't add to that, can you? The apostle
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:42.560]   is writing to these foolish Corinthian Christians who are glorying in men, trying to get something
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.600]   by saying they belong to this party or to that, naming this man or that man. "What
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.280]   are you talking about?" he says. "Therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.880]   yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:06.080]   or things to come. All are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is God." Go home and
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:15.960]   read it again. 1 Corinthians 3, verses 21 to the end. "All things are yours because
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.000]   of your relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ." If you like, we are joint heirs with him.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.600]   That's the position of the wife. Joint heirs. "Blessed are the meek," says our Lord,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:32.800]   "for they shall inherit the earth." Everything, all things are yours. Life, death, everything
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:40.280]   else. And then again I go back to the epistle to the Hebrews because he puts that again
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   once more so wonderfully in his second chapter in verse 5. He says, "For unto the angels
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:55.240]   hath he not put in subjection that world to come of which we speak." Well, to whom has
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.320]   it been put in subjection? To us, he says. Not to the angels. They are only the servants.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.480]   They are our servants. They are ministering spirits serving us. But the world to come
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:12.800]   whereof we speak is not to be set in subjection unto them, but unto us. It's ours. That's
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.640]   the inheritance which we look forward to as heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ in
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:29.000]   this context because we are married to the Son of God, the heir of the whole universe.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:39.440]   But then I must say a word about this. As married to the Lord Jesus Christ, we are in
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:50.320]   a position to know his love which no one else is in. It is to his bride that the bridegroom
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.480]   reveals and manifests his love. Therefore says the apostle Paul, "Husbands, love your
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:07.640]   wives." How? Even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. That's how husbands
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:13.080]   are to love their wives. That gives us some indication of his love to us as Christian
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:19.960]   people. It is this peculiar intimate love, it is this manifestation of his feelings,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.640]   of his affections, which he shows to nobody else, the peculiar treasure and privilege
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:36.560]   of the bride. You know, Christian people, it's because we don't know our scriptures
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:43.680]   that we live as we do. It is because we are ignorant of these scriptures that we too often
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:50.940]   live as paupers instead of realizing that we are married to a prince. The manifestations
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:57.240]   of his love, what do we know about it? Well, our hymn has just reminded us, "The love
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:05.560]   of Jesus, what it is, none but his loved ones know." The world knows nothing about it.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.760]   It cannot know. It never felt it. It cannot. They will know the wrath of the man, the love
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:25.000]   of Jesus, what it is. None but his loved ones know. Do you know it? He's promised it, hasn't
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.400]   he? He said, "I will manifest myself unto him." He doesn't manifest himself to any
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.680]   but the bride. Has he spoken to you as he said, "As the lily among thorns, so is my
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:43.640]   love among the daughters." Has he ever said to you, whispered to you, "My beloved is
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:53.000]   mine." Go and read the Song of Solomon. There is how the bridegroom expresses his
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:03.920]   feeling to the bride, his love. Oh, how lightly we skip over these phrases so that we may
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.960]   argue about our pet theories. But my dear friend, the whole object of being a Christian
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:16.560]   in a sense is that you may know the love of Jesus Christ, his personal love to you, that
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.400]   he tells you in unmistakable language that he loves you, and that he has given himself
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:29.440]   for you, that he has loved you with an everlasting love. That's the thing. And that, of course,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:38.200]   is something that he does through the Holy Spirit. He seals all his statements to you.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   The Spirit beareth witness with our spirits. He's telling you directly. Of course you
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.320]   believe it in the Word, but there's more than that. He will tell you this as a great
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:55.480]   secret just between the two of you. That's what it means. The secret manifestations of
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:04.680]   the Son of God to his own, to his beloved, to those for whom he has gladly died and given
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:13.440]   himself. What do we know about these secret intimations? You go and read the lives of
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.440]   God's saints throughout the centuries, and you'll find that they all knew about this.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.400]   They have known him come to them and speak to them, and love them and tell them that
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:33.360]   he loves them, and embrace them and surround them, and let them know more certainly than
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:42.600]   they know anything else that he loves them with all the intensity of his divine being.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   It's because we are married to him that he does this. The love of Jesus, what it is,
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:54.000]   none but his loved ones know. But do the loved ones know it as they should? You give him
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.680]   an opportunity to tell you. You put everything on one side in order to look into his face
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.120]   and to listen to him. Or when he comes to you, are you busy with other things? Or are
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.440]   you like the bride depicted in the fifth chapter of the Song of Solomon? Are you lying in bed,
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.320]   and you've gone to bed and you've put your clothes off, and you hear him at the door
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.880]   and you say, "I'm sorry, I can't come now, I can't open to you, I'm asleep, leave me
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.080]   alone." And then you suddenly realize what a fool you've been, and you get up and you
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.280]   open the door, but he's gone, and you've got nothing left but the smell of the myrrh
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.480]   that has been dropping from his fingers, and you don't know what to do with yourself,
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   and you seek him. If you would know this love of Jesus, what it is, give him opportunities
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:44.640]   of telling you. He'll meet you in this word, and he'll tell you. Give time, give place,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.800]   give opportunity. Set other things aside. Say, "I'm sorry, I can't fulfill that engagement,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.160]   I can't do what you're asking me to do. No, no, I've got another appointment. I know he's
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.520]   coming, and I'm waiting for him." Are you looking for him? Are you expecting him? Do
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.240]   you allow him, do you give him opportunities, as it were, to speak to you, and to let you
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:12.040]   know his love to you? We are married to him. We all know what the law told us in the old
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.680]   life, don't we? There was no question about that. Its threats, its condemnations, we all
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   heard it, and we all knew it, and we paid great attention to it. But we're no longer
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.360]   married to the law. We must listen to all that, turn our back on it, listen to him,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:32.640]   look into his face. Hear what he's got to tell you about his love for you.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:41.480]   And then another thing, the sixth thing, which results from this, is his care and his protection.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:48.400]   "No man," says the apostle in writing to the Ephesians, again in chapter 5, verse 29,
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:55.760]   "No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it, even as the
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:07.000]   Lord the Church." The Lord nourisheth and cherisheth the Church. His care for us, his
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.480]   protection for us. Every husband here knows what I'm talking about. But multiply it by
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.560]   infinity and there is the care of the Lord Jesus Christ for every Christian who is married
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:31.040]   to him. He thinks ahead for us. He plans for us. He protects us. It is he who commands
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.000]   these angels to come and look after us and shield us and guard us. There is nothing that
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.880]   he will not do for us. He knows the dangers of our position. He's separated from us for
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:50.800]   the time being in this physical sense. And so he is caring for us and protecting us.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:57.720]   And thank God we are reminded by Jude in his epistle that he is so strong that he is able
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:04.000]   to keep us from falling. We are walking in a world that is full of obstacles and things
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.480]   over which we can trip and fall and be led astray. And to him that is able to keep you
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:21.240]   from falling. That is the manifestation of his care and his protection. He sees that
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:29.480]   we have ample food. He sees that we have supplies of the Spirit. Everything we need. It's
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.240]   all here, you know. It says Peter in his second epistle in the first chapter, "All things
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:41.920]   that pertain to life and godliness have been provided for us by his virtue, by his strength."
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:49.160]   You have no complaint. You have no excuse. He has given us everything that we can stand
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.800]   in need of while we are passing through this world, from this word to everything else.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:04.560]   It's all provided. His care and his protection for the bride that is married to him. And
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.960]   the last thing that I would notice under this heading is this. His desire and his purpose
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.080]   for us. And we are told some very wonderful things here again. Let me go back to that
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:24.360]   great statement in Jude's epistle. "Unto him that is able to keep us from falling."
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:34.000]   What else? "To present us faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.800]   You see the metaphors break down. They're not quite adequate, but what we are told here
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.240]   is this. That he, his great pride as it were, his great desire and purpose is that at that
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:52.880]   great day he will finally present his bride to his Father. Able to keep us from falling.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:32:03.200]   And to present us faultless before the presence of the glory of God with exceeding joy. If
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.600]   you like the picture is this. Of a bridegroom taking his bride home. Showing her to the
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:17.680]   family proud of her. He's made her by this faultless. And he does it therefore with exceeding
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.760]   joy. Well to vary the imagery just a little I take you to the book of Revelation where
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:32.600]   the same thing exactly is really stated in verse 19. Let me read to you verses 6 to 9
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   of the 19th chapter of the book of Revelation. "And I heard as it were the voice of a great
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:45.840]   multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:56.160]   'Hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:04.760]   to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready." This
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:11.040]   is the whole church by now. "And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:20.720]   linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. And he saith
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:29.400]   unto me write 'Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.'
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:39.880]   And he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God." We are married to him now but we
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:47.320]   don't realize it fully then we shall when this great marriage feast comes. And the bride
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:53.680]   will be ready and attired and dressed and prepared and everything will be perfect. Now
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.320]   that's all talking about us who are Christian. Those who are already married to him. But
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:08.680]   that great consummation is finally coming. Well now then there are some of these deductions
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:15.480]   which we draw with regard to the privileges that are ours because of our union with the
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:23.680]   Lord Jesus Christ. But now I come to yet another division of the matter. If those are the privileges
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:30.080]   of the union what is the purpose of the union? Now this is the thing that the apostle has
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.240]   particularly in his mind in this fourth verse of this seventh chapter of the epistle to
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:40.880]   the Romans. All the other things are there and we must draw them out? Don't you thank
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.520]   me for having done so? Or is there some pedant here who says, "Ah, but after all Paul is
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.640]   only concerned in this fourth verse with the purposes of the union and why have you gone
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:56.800]   after all those other things?" Do you really want to say that? Well if you do I'm tempted
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.400]   to say to you that you're not a Christian. When would I have an opportunity of telling
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.460]   you these things? No, no my friends when you're studying the scriptures and when you find
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:12.900]   any comparison used, draw out its consequences. Never say I'll do that when I come to some
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.880]   other passage. You may never come to the other passage. If you're told here that you're
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:22.520]   married to Christ, draw out all your consequences. Find them elsewhere in the scripture. Gather
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.560]   them together. Remind yourself of them. They're all here. But now we come to the purpose of
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:35.520]   the union. And this is, I say, the thing that was uttermost in the apostle's mind because
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.080]   of the particular argument that he was engaged in at this point. What is the purpose of this
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:49.360]   union? Well he tells us that in order that we should bring forth fruit unto God. Fruit
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.960]   means children if you like. The fruit of the marriage, the offspring, the children that
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.080]   are going to be born. That's why you're married, he says, that you may bring forth
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:10.280]   fruit unto God. Now let's look at this. Notice negatively that the marriage, this
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:17.600]   marriage of ours, this wedding between us and the Son of God, must never be regarded
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:25.520]   only from our standpoint. You see it's there we go wrong and miss so much. We start with
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.320]   ourselves and we end with ourselves. What am I to get out of this? And of course it's
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.680]   the evangelism that does it. It puts it in that form. It represents the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.640]   as just some agency to bless us. It's looking at it the wrong way around, my dear friend.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:48.320]   Don't be negative, I say. What's the object of this marriage with the Son of God? Well
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:54.160]   it isn't only that we may be forgiven. We must never stop at forgiveness. The Bible
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:37:02.200]   never does. It isn't only forgiveness. It isn't merely that I might have security.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:11.320]   It's a very poor sort of bride who simply gets married in order that she may have security.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:16.760]   There are people who do that, but it's a very poor sort of bride. She says, "I won't
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:24.080]   have to work anymore. My future is made certain. I'll be looked after in my old age." Well,
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.480]   that's not right. You despise such an attitude, don't you? A mercenary view of marriage.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:35.120]   Even on the human level, we despise it. But fancy people claiming to believe in the Lord
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:44.720]   Jesus Christ for such reasons. Thank God we are given forgiveness. We are given security.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.240]   But you don't enter into the marriage in order to have these things. This isn't the
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:58.280]   motive. Neither is it happiness. Neither is it joy. Neither is it that you may have help
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.480]   and be able to share your problems and your burdens and have somebody at hand always to
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   help you. Neither is it to have healing for your body. Neither, I add, is it to have experiences
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   only. I've been talking about the wonderful experiences of His love, but you don't get
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:24.640]   married merely for the experiences. Neither is it that we may get victory over certain
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.720]   particular sins that happen to be bothering us. Isn't that the approach of many? They
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.640]   say, "You know, this thing's been getting me down. I've been trying my best. I can't
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.680]   do it." And their one concern is, "How am I to get rid of this particular sin?" And
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.760]   indeed, they're encouraged to do that. There are people who confront them and say, "Now
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.960]   you come and listen where I listen, and then you'll be delivered. You'll be given help
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.160]   and you'll get rid of that sin. It'll be taken from you." That's all they want.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.840]   They feel they've got it and all is well. And oh, what they haven't realized, what they've
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.600]   missed. All they wanted was to get rid of this one sin. They've never thought about
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.120]   knowing Him and His love and all these other glorious and wonderful things. They're only
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.640]   interested in themselves and their own problems. Their approach is purely subjective. They
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:12.080]   know nothing about forgetting themselves in His love and in His presence. Thank God, I
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.960]   say that these things happen to us because of the marriage. They're all true. But what
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.560]   I'm emphasizing is this. They are not the purpose. They are not the object. They are
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:30.600]   not the motive. I don't like a title such as "The Christian
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:42.680]   Secret of a Happy Life." No, no. You mustn't even put happiness first. He must be first.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.440]   It's the relationship to Him. It's the knowledge of Him that matters. "Christian Secret of
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:51.960]   a Happy Life." No, no. The Christian's life in Christ as His bride, knowing Him. That's
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.960]   the thing. Happiness is a by-product. It should never be put in the center. None of these
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:03.720]   things should be put in the center. And that is why, you know, people who even write books
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:11.400]   with that title end their lives in misery and unhappiness. That's history. That's
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:18.520]   a fact. The author of the book which is called "The Christian Secret of a Happy Life"
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.280]   spent years, the latter years of our life, in great unhappiness and misery. I'm not
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.320]   surprised. You put happiness first, you'll probably lose it. You may think you've got
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.800]   it. You may get a kind of happiness temporarily, but you'll never hold it. He is what matters,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   not happiness. Well, what then is the purpose and the object
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.960]   of the marriage? Let me give it to you first of all as the apostle puts it in Ephesians
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.320]   5, 25 and following. "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ loved the church and
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.760]   gave himself for it." Why? "That in order that he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:03.880]   the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church,
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:12.320]   not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish."
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:26.280]   That's it. He's married us in order that he might sanctify and cleanse us and present
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:35.400]   us to himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that we should
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   be holy and without blemish. Oh, but you can't improve on the way the apostle puts it here,
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:49.320]   "that we may bring forth fruit, bear fruit, bear a progeny unto God." And what is the
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:42:01.160]   fruit? The fruit is holiness. What is holiness? What is holiness? Holiness is to live to
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:09.760]   God's glory and to God's praise. Holiness isn't a feeling. Holiness is a life. Live
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:18.480]   to the glory of God and to his eternal praise. What is the fruit? The fruit is the fruit
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:28.120]   of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, faith, and
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:36.280]   temperance. We are married to him in order that we may bring forth such fruit. Let me
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:43.160]   put it plainly and clearly as I close. The apostle is saying here that it was essential
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.040]   we should be married to him. Why? Well, because until we are married to him we shall never
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:55.960]   bear these children, this fruit. We were married to the law, but you know the law was impotent.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:01.880]   It couldn't bring forth children out of us. That's what he's saying. But we are now married
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:08.080]   to one who has the strength and the virility and the potency to produce children even out
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:14.600]   of us. It's his strength that matters. The apostle, of course, puts it explicitly in
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.520]   the third verse of the next chapter, the eighth chapter. For, he says, what the law could
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:26.720]   not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:33.520]   sinful flesh, etc., has done it. What has he done? That the righteousness of the law
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:40.440]   might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. Here's the
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:49.400]   real purpose of the marriage. We need one whose seed is so powerful, who can so impregnate
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:55.920]   us with his own holy nature that he'll produce holiness even in us. That's why we are married
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:05.800]   to him, in order that we should bring forth fruit unto God. His strength is so great,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:14.840]   his might is so potent, that even out of us he can bear this progeny of holiness. And
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.160]   you see, therefore, what the apostles are arguing about. He says, you know, you have
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.600]   to be delivered from your marriage to the law. You'd never produce it. Impossible.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.080]   You have to die to that law, that that old marriage should be dissolved, in order that
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:37.440]   you might be married to this mighty one who can produce the fruit in you. And he says
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:49.640]   it's happened. The central object of salvation is holiness. And that is why I wouldn't hesitate
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:56.320]   to say that it is sinful to say that you can stop at justification, that a man can be justified
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.440]   and not sanctified. It's impossible. He of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.080]   sanctification, and redemption. You cannot stop at justification. They must never be
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:16.560]   separated. The whole object of the whole movement is that we might be holy, so that from the
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:25.440]   moment we are joined to him, the process begins. From the moment of the marriage and the union,
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:35.320]   and the two shall become one flesh, his life begins to enter, his power begins to work.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.920]   And though the progeny, the fruit, may appear at times to be very small and weak and ailing
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:48.800]   and merasmic, it is nevertheless the life of God in the soul. It is nevertheless true
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:57.120]   to say that we are partakers of the divine nature, and we are already bearing forth something
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:04.160]   of this fruit, which is holiness unto God.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:12.040]   Well, thank God for Romans 7, wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:18.320]   law by the body of Christ, in order that ye should be married to another, even to him
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:29.720]   who is raised from the dead, in order that we should bring forth fruit unto God, who
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:39.040]   rejoices to see it, and pronounces his benediction upon it and upon us.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.040]   Amen.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:52.520]   O Lord, our God, we once more know not what to say in thy holy presence. O Lord, we but
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:59.240]   ascribe unto thee all praise and honour and glory and might and majesty and dominion and
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   power. They are thine, but we would ascribe them unto thee again. O Lord, what can we
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:14.040]   say when we realize something of what thou hast done for us? The name thou hast put
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:19.320]   upon us, thou hast blessed, thou hast brought to pass the union, thou didst purpose it,
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:29.400]   thou hast blessed it, thou hast put his name upon us. O God, receive our worship and our
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:38.920]   praise. We offer it in the name of him to whom thou hast married us, even thine only
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:46.160]   begotten Son, our blessed Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.040]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:58.840]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us, now this night, throughout
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:07.360]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:18.560]   shall see him as he is and realize the fullness of his love toward us. Amen.
