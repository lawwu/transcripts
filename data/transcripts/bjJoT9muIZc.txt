[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   When I used the word "hustle" in 2008, 9, 10, the intent is like, "Hey, there's opportunity and you can go get it."
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.240]   I'm thrilled to change that word to tenacity or grit or work ethic.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.320]   I'm incredibly self-aware that the way I communicate with the excitement level,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.080]   with the energy, with the Jersey chat of it, I'm very genuinely compassionate and understanding

[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.880]   I deploy enormous humility when I'm about to say what I'm saying.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.320]   I would never expect someone to spend five hours to double-click into it and
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.760]   actually understand what I'm about and what I'm saying. I guess at the end of the day,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.720]   what are they missing? They're not missing anything if they're just doing a drive-by
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.560]   and reading a headline. If they've spent two or three hours on me through content or interaction
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.960]   or people that really know me, I doubt they'd be missing anything because I think they would
