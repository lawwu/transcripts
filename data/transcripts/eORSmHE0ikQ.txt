[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   I would like to call your attention this morning to the words that are to be found in the book
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:15.480]   of Genesis chapter 26 and verses 17 and 18. Verses 17 and 18 in the 26th chapter of the
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.600]   book of Genesis. "And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.120]   and dwelt there. And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:40.760]   days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.240]   and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them." Now
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.880]   those who were here last Sunday morning will realize we are continuing a theme and a subject
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.320]   which we began considering on that occasion. I am calling attention to this incident in
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.640]   the life of Isaac because of the light which it seems to me to throw upon the whole condition
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.360]   of the church today, and especially in connection with this great and urgent need of revival
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.120]   and of reawakening. Now let me just remind you of the general picture. We have seen certain
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.800]   things. We have emphasized the desperate character of the need. Isaac was looking for water,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.280]   and without water you cannot live. And the problem confronting the church today is the
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.920]   whole question of her life, her continuance, her real being and existence as the church
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.680]   of the living God. We are not interested in secondary and third-rate matters. The spiritual
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.840]   conflict that is going on in the world at the present time is desperate, and if we as
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.520]   Christian people fail to realize that, we cannot possibly be functioning as we are meant
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.840]   to do as members of the Christian church at this present time. The need is indeed as urgent
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   as it can possibly be. It is as urgent as it has ever been. All the authorities are
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.720]   prepared to agree in the statement that the church today is in a sense fighting, and fighting
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.480]   for her life in a way that she has not had to do perhaps since the first centuries of
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.360]   her being and existence. The position is really desperate. Then we saw what Isaac did not
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.120]   do in this situation. He did not send for the prospectors and the diviners. The thing
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.240]   was too urgent for that. He must have a supply. And likewise we see that you and I today have
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.000]   no time to be indulging in vain speculation or inquiries after truth so-called. The need
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.560]   is urgent, and therefore we must follow Isaac in what he actually did. He went back to the
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.080]   wells that they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. And I am suggesting that
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.240]   the essence of wisdom for the church at a time like this is to look back into her own
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.520]   history. And as she does so, she will see very clearly that there have been similar
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.760]   periods of declension. Sometimes, as I say, as bad as the present, sometimes not as bad
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.400]   as the present. But there have been periods of declension. And it is important we should
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.680]   go back and read them and study them. For we shall find that in spite of the declension,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.320]   God has again visited his people and has revived his church and his cause.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.160]   So we dwelt upon the value of the history of the past as we face the problems of today.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.260]   The mentality, the outlook which takes it for granted that the past has got nothing
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:15.640]   to teach us is just not Christian. Christianity works on this principle that what was revealed
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.560]   nearly two thousand years ago is what is needed most today, and that the problem is always
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.080]   the same, because God does not change and man in sin does not change.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.120]   Very well, Isaac went back again to the wells that they had digged in the days of Abraham
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.640]   his father. But when he did that and got there, he found that the Philistines had been there
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.360]   and had stopped these wells. They had thrown earth and all kinds of refuse into these wells.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.920]   They had filled them with earth, we are told in verse 15. And that was the point at which
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   we left off last Sunday morning. The proposition I am laying down, in other
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.120]   words, is this, that the trouble today in the Christian church and the failure of the
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   church to deal with the whole problem of sin in the world outside is entirely due to the
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:24.680]   rubbish and the earth that the modern Philistines have thrown into the wells of God and have
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.120]   thereby stopped. Now that is my proposition, which I must proceed
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.200]   to demonstrate and to elaborate. Now, the evidence, it seems to me, that is provided
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:46.280]   by the history of the church herself establishes this point, this principle that I am enunciating
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.520]   to you, beyond any doubt whatsoever. Now, I say that what history, the history of the
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.280]   church manifests and demonstrates is this, that the trouble always has been due to this
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:13.360]   same activity of the Philistines, who have stopped the wells, thrown in material that
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   is there between the people in their need and the supply of water that is there down
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.720]   at the bottom. Now then, let me give you the evidence. I can
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:32.320]   summarize, I think, the history of the Christian church in this respect, in this way. The concealing
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:41.120]   and the neglect of certain truths and certain aspects of Christian truth has always been
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:48.800]   the chief characteristic of every period of declension in the long history of the church.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.040]   Here is my first proposal, my first principle. You read the history of the church and look
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.320]   at these periods of declension when the church was murmured and did not seem to count at
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.640]   all, and you will find that without a single exception, the thing that has most characterized
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:14.180]   the life of the church at such a time has been either a denial or else a concealing
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:23.220]   or else a neglect of certain vital truths which are essential to the whole Christian
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.640]   position. Now, I could illustrate this at great length.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.400]   Let me just pick out the most notable examples. Take, for instance, the period before the
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.700]   Protestant Reformation, the Dark Ages followed by that period leading up to the Reformation
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.360]   in the sixteenth century. What was the great characteristic of the church then? Well, it
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:54.760]   was this precise thing to which I am adverting. The vital truths of salvation could not be
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:05.200]   seen. They were entirely hidden, cluttered up, covered over by all that mass of teaching
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.980]   which characterized the Roman Catholic Church at that time. The people had no spiritual
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.360]   life. They were kept in darkness and in ignorance. They did not know the great truths of the
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.280]   gospel and of salvation. Why not? Well, they were covered over by these other things. That
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.720]   was the great characteristic of the life of the church at that time.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:35.160]   But then when you come forward to the eighteenth century, you will find exactly the same thing.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.000]   Before that great evangelical awakening of the eighteenth century, that great revival
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.280]   which we associate with the names of Whitefield and the Wesleys particularly in this country,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.800]   before that great revival, the condition of the church was again exactly as I am describing
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:01.040]   it to you. It was murried and it was useless. The vast majority of people did not attend
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.560]   a place of worship. There was little evidence at all of any vital Christianity. What was
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.240]   it due to? Well, the whole state of the church at that time was again a repetition more or
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.840]   less of that which obtained before the Reformation, in a slightly different form of course. What
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.440]   was it? Well, it was that these great cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith were not
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.280]   being preached. They were not believed. What was the controlling climate? It was this.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   It was what was called deism. Deism. That's a system of truth which more or less, as I
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:49.040]   shall show you in a few moments, cuts God off from an active interest in his own universe.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.160]   Deism and rationalism were in control. There were certain men who were disturbed about
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.800]   this. There was the great Bishop Butler who wrote his famous Analogy of Religion. He wrote
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   that book in order to try to counter this deadness of deism and of rationalism. But
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.640]   you see, that was the state of the church. The living water of salvation was hidden,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:19.680]   covered over, cluttered up by all this rationalism and philosophy that was covering it over.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.240]   And then, in a most interesting way, when you come to read the history preceding the
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:34.000]   outbreak of the great revival of 1859, and particularly in Ireland, you will find exactly
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.960]   the same thing. Now, this, as I say, is 1959, and we're all, I trust, thinking of that
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.440]   great revival that broke out in 1857 in the United States, and then later, end of '58
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   and '59, in Northern Ireland and in Wales and in Scotland, and even in Sweden and other
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.800]   places. You read the history. And incidentally, let me say in passing that there is one, at
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.920]   any rate, very excellent book available on the history of that revival in Northern Ireland.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.320]   And if we can help you by supplying copies, we shall be glad to do so. We are going to
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   obtain them, a history of the revival of 1859 in Northern Ireland. But now, this is what
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:27.440]   you'll find, that the period before the revival was again characterized by this same deadness,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:35.060]   terrible deadness. And it took a particular form. The Presbyterian church in Northern
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:43.040]   Ireland, years before that revival, I'm thinking particularly of the twenties and the thirties,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.920]   had gone astray in its doctrine. It had espoused a doctrine which is called Arianism. And what
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.120]   Arianism is, is this. It denies the eternity and the Godhead of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.760]   Arius taught that the Lord Jesus Christ was a created being, that he was not co-equal
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:12.440]   and co-eternal with the Father. It denied him his Godhead. Now, that was the cause of
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.480]   the state of the church, its utter deadness and uselessness. And it was only when that
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:25.760]   was corrected and swept aside, and the church came back to the true doctrine, that the revival
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.960]   broke forth amongst the people. Well, now there is my first bit of evidence. The concealing
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.520]   and the neglect of certain vital truths has always been the chief characteristic of the
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:47.560]   life of the church in every period of deadness and of declension. Secondly, no revival has
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:55.800]   ever been known in the history of churches which deny or ignore certain essential truths.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:04.520]   Now, I regard that as an astoundingly important point. You have never heard of a revival in
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:12.840]   churches so called, which deny the cardinal and fundamental articles of our Christian
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:21.080]   faith. For instance, you have never heard of a revival amongst the Unitarians. And you
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.480]   have never heard of it because there has never been one. There has never been a revival amongst
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:33.920]   those who call themselves Unitarians. Now, that is a sheer fact of history. And surely
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.440]   it behoves us to face that fact. In exactly the same way, there has never been a revival
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.960]   in the Roman Catholic Church. Thank God there have been individuals who were brought up
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.560]   and born as Roman Catholics, who having seen the truth have been revived, but it has led
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.280]   invariably to their leaving their church. You have never had a revival in the church
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.840]   as such. The thing is impossible because of the neglect and the covering over of these
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:10.520]   vital truths. Thirdly, you will find in the history of the church very clearly that such
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:18.600]   churches have always opposed and have always persecuted those who have been in the midst
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:25.080]   of revival. Now, this is sheer history. This is not my opinion. A hundred years ago when
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.360]   this great revival broke out, the Unitarians opposed it in the United States, in Northern
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:36.520]   Ireland, everywhere. They always oppose revival. They are bound to be consistent with themselves.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:43.840]   They are rationalists and they hate it. Likewise, the Roman Catholics have always opposed revival
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.240]   and have always persecuted bitterly those who have experienced it. You will read in
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.400]   the history of Northern Ireland, for instance, a hundred years ago, that they were actually
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:04.040]   putting on sale their so-called holy water and urging people to sprinkle it upon themselves
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:10.200]   and even to drink it in order to avoid and to evade this horrible, devilish thing which
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:16.600]   was being called revival. That is the attitude of that church always to a truly spiritual
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.920]   religion. Now, I am not saying these things because it gives me any pleasure to say these
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.640]   things about the Roman Catholic Church or about the Unitarians. I am adverting to them
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.800]   for one reason only, that if we really are concerned about revival, we have got to discover
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:40.000]   the things that hinder revival. And it is the concealing of vital truths and doctrines,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   you see, that has always done this.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.880]   And then I come to my last principle under this heading, which is this. Without a single
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:16:03.200]   exception, it is the rediscovery of these cardinal doctrines that has always led ultimately
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:11.480]   to revival. There is always a preliminary to revival. A revival appears to come suddenly,
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.400]   and in a sense it does. But if you look carefully into the history, you will always find that
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.640]   there was something going on quietly. There was a preliminary. There was a preparation
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:29.800]   unobserved by people. And the preparation, invariably, has been a rediscovery of these
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.480]   grand and glorious central truths.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:39.240]   Now, take the history of the Protestant Reformation. Surely everybody knows, however ignorant we
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   may be of church history, that it was when Martin Luther suddenly saw that grand truth
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.000]   of justification by faith only. It was after he had seen that that the Protestant revival
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.680]   came. Reformation precedes revival. It was getting back to that truth in the epistles
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.800]   to the Galatians and the Romans that prepared the way for the shedding of the Spirit. It
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.320]   happened in this country. It happened in every country where the Reformation spread. It was
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:16.160]   the same in the seventeenth century, not to the same degree, but it was the emphasis upon
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.760]   these truths that led to the great blessing that was experienced in the Puritan era. And
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:29.920]   then everybody surely must know that that was what happened in the eighteenth century.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.880]   There you had that deadness, I say. Bishop Butler wrote his book, The Analogy of Religion.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.760]   It started their Boyle lectures in an attempt to counter this rationalism, but it availed
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.440]   nothing. Then suddenly the revival seemed to come. Whitefield, Wesley, and the others.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:55.600]   Yes, but how did it come through these men? Well, everybody knows the story. What really
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.800]   made it possible for John Wesley to have the experience he had in Aldersgate Street, when
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:07.600]   his heart was strangely warmed by the Holy Spirit, was the fact that three months before
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:16.160]   he had the experience in Aldersgate Street on May 24, 1738, yes, but in March 1738, his
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:24.240]   eyes were opened to the truth of justification by faith only. The famous conversation between
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   here and Oxford, between Wesley and Peter Burler, it was all about justification by
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:35.960]   faith only. It was only after he'd seen that, and it had gripped him, that the Holy
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.520]   Spirit came upon him and began to use him. And this is not only true of Wesley. The same
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.520]   thing had already happened, in a sense, to Whitefield. And certainly, if you go to Wales
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.720]   at that time, the greatest preacher there at that time was a man called Daniel Rowlands,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:00.240]   of whom Bishop Royal ventures to say that he was possibly the greatest preacher since
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.920]   the apostles. Well, his story was precisely the same thing. He was a curate, he was a
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:12.080]   preacher, but it was useless, it was dead, and nothing happened under his ministry. Then
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   he went and listened to a great preacher called Griffith Jones one day, and he was convinced
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.680]   and convicted of the truth of justification by faith only. And it was only after seeing
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.960]   that and realizing it, though he hadn't felt its power, it was a few months after
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.120]   that that suddenly one day, as he was taking his communion service, the Holy Spirit came
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.840]   upon him and filled him, and the great revival broke out in that country in the eighteenth
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:48.040]   century. Now this is, I say, always the case. And as I've already reminded you, it was
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:54.200]   the same a hundred years ago, and particularly in Northern Ireland. It was as they got rid
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.000]   of this Arianism and saw the importance of the full truth concerning the person of our
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.600]   Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that the mighty blessing came.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:14.040]   There are, then, I am urging, and doing so on the basis of history, certain truths which
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:22.760]   are absolutely essential to revival. And while these truths are denied or are neglected or
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:31.520]   ignored, we have no right to expect the blessing of revival. The Philistines keep on coming,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.720]   and they throw in their earth and their rubbish, and the water of life is hidden out of sight.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:49.000]   Now I confess freely that if I consulted my own inclinations and my own desires, I would
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   not be referring to these things. I know that I am again exposing myself to the charge of
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:10.160]   censoriousness and criticism of others, and of separatism, and of individualism, and non-cooperation.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.240]   But after all, if a man goes into a pulpit simply to consult his own feelings and his
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:21.400]   own reputation, he has no business to be there. It's no pleasant task to me to have to say
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.360]   the things I am saying. I am saying them for one reason only, that I have this profound
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.160]   conviction on the basis of the Scripture, supported to the hilt as I have been showing
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.800]   you by the history of the Christian Church, that while these truths are neglected, denied,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:46.600]   or even ignored, you cannot have revival. We have got to start with this work of the
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:52.120]   Philistines. It is no use saying, "Let's pray for revival." There is something we
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:58.720]   have to do before that. The work of the Philistines has got to be cleared out. That is what Isaac
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:05.040]   did. They digged again the wells which they had digged in the days of Abraham, his father.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.120]   They cleared out the rubbish, and the refuse, and the earth, and there was the water as
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.240]   before. Every revival, I say, indicates and shows clearly that that preliminary work has
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.120]   always been done.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:25.280]   And therefore, I have certain things which I must put before you. There are certain truths
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:33.280]   which must be believed. And I have given you my evidence for that statement. It isn't
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:40.480]   my opinion. It is history that says that. The Bible says it. There are certain truths
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.120]   that must be believed. There has never been revival until they have been believed. And
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.680]   a denial of them is a blank prohibition of revival. It cannot happen while these truths
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.840]   are denied. Therefore, I say we must look at them and we must take them in the right
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   order.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:04.440]   Now then, what are the truths that are denied by the Philistines? What are these fundamental
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:14.160]   truths that are concealed by the nefarious work of the Philistines? Here is the first,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:25.560]   the truth concerning the sovereign, transcendent, living God who acts and who intervenes and
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.680]   erupts into the history of the Church and of individuals.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:38.840]   I must start with it. It is the foundation of all doctrine. Look at the apostle writing
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:45.080]   there to Timothy. Ah, things were difficult. Timothy was troubled. He was losing hope.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.760]   He was wondering what the future was going to hold. Paul was aged and was dying. And
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.640]   here was Timothy frightened and alarmed. And Paul writes to him and says, "Well, what
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.760]   you are saying is very true. I know about these people who are denying the truths and
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   so on." And what does he say to him? "Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure. The basis
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:22.280]   of everything is the sovereign, transcendent, living God who in his eternal glorious freedom
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:32.680]   acts, intervenes in, erupts into, interferes with the life of the whole Church and of individuals."
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:41.800]   And if there is anything that is more obvious than anything else in the life of the Church
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:53.640]   today, it is the failure to start with and to believe that truth. What have we today?
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:25:03.040]   We have the God of the philosophers. And the God of the philosophers is not the sovereign,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.320]   living, transcendent God. He is an abstraction. They talk about the absolute and the uncaused
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:17.800]   cause. What a way to speak of God. God is not an abstraction. God is not a philosophic
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:29.360]   concept. God is, and he alone is. He is life and the author of all life and being. And
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.200]   they argue about him with their pipes in their mouths and talk about him as if he is a term
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:46.240]   that they can handle and bambi about. You will never have revival in such conditions.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:53.080]   God I say is not an abstraction. Someone to be argued and thought about and fitted into
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.440]   our schemes. Philosophy has always been the curse in the life of the Church and is the
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:09.720]   curse today. Another way in which this glorious truth about God is being concealed is by what
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:18.760]   they call their philosophy of imminence. God in everything, not God transcendent, but God
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:25.840]   imminent. You see, they say God is in everything. God is in the whole of nature. It is not exactly
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.160]   a pantheism, but it comes very near to it. But you see, the argument is that because
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.040]   God is in everything, you do not expect God to act from the outside. God is everywhere,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.840]   in everything. Everything is sacred, and they dislike the distinction between the sacred
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:49.320]   and the secular. That is another way of denying his sovereignty and his eternal transcendence.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:58.160]   And then this other thing which I have referred to as deism. It is very common today, though
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.240]   it is not often given that name. It was given the name two hundred years ago, but it should
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:12.160]   be given the name today. It is a belief about God which believes in him as the creator only.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:20.040]   But it says that God, having created the world, has no further interest in the world. It admits
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:26.240]   a kind of divine providence, but only in the realm of things material, not at all in the
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:32.600]   realm of the moral and not at all in the realm of the spiritual. God, as it were, shut out
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.160]   of his own universe. He made it like a great watchmaker making a watch and winding it up,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.880]   and having done so, he just allows it to go on on its own. Deism. I do not want to stop
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.720]   with this, but I do ask you to examine even your own thoughts and to realize the thoughts
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.840]   that are controlling so many in the Christian church today. Their idea of God is that he
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:07.520]   is a God who does not intervene. He is a God who does not act. He is a God who is passive.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:13.120]   He is a God whom they are always having to approach. They are always moving. He remains
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:23.800]   away in some distant eternity, absolutely impassive, unmovable and not moving. He is
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:32.960]   this remote God. And they consequently do not believe in revival because that means
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:40.800]   essentially God acting, God coming in, God breaking in. And so if we have the God of
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:50.040]   the philosophers and the God of the deists and the rationalists, we shall never experience
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.560]   revival. Indeed, prayer almost becomes a waste of time and quite ridiculous. And how often
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:01.000]   that is precisely what is true to say about prayer. It is something formal and mechanical.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.760]   You either read your prayers or you mutter them up. It is a formality. There is no living
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:12.640]   contact. Nothing is expected. God is banished into his own eternity. And man occupies the
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.520]   center of the stage. And it is his thoughts about God that matter, not God's thoughts
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:36.920]   about him. What is your belief in God, my friend? Do you believe in the sovereign, transcendent,
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:43.840]   everlasting God of the universe who is active in his control still? Our Lord said, "My
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   Father worketh hitherto and I work." Not your immanentist idea, neither some transcendence
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:30:01.320]   that banishes him out of the universe almost, but both God above and yet in, acting, interfering,
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.840]   the God that visits his people.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:16.160]   How can we pray truly unless we are clear and correct in our ideas of the sovereign,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:24.600]   living, transcendent God? You see, the work of the Philistines has been to obscure that,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.120]   and it must be got rid of before we can get back again to the water. But let me hurry
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:37.640]   to a second thing. It follows from the first, the authority of this book, the authority
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:49.400]   of the Bible. The work of the Philistines is invariably this. I have got to speak generally
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.080]   because there are groups and divisions even amongst the Philistines, but I have got to
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.840]   put it generally to save time, otherwise this will occupy us for months and we must hurry
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   on.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:06.680]   They deny revelation. Revelation. Of course, if their view of God is what I have been describing,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:18.100]   you cannot have revelation. They do not believe in revelation. They do not believe in inspiration.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:25.160]   They do not really believe that God has revealed the truth concerning himself in propositions
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:31.640]   and in statements as they are recorded in this book which we call the Bible. They do
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:38.320]   not believe this. Well, what is their position? How do they arrive at truth? Ah, well, they
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:44.520]   say that they arrive at truth by searching for it, by their reason, by their understanding,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:54.120]   by their speculation. Now, this can be put very simply. The whole emphasis today is upon
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:32:03.000]   man's search for God, as if God had never revealed himself at all. The whole case of
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.360]   the Bible is that God is searching for men and that God has revealed himself to men because
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:16.880]   men by searching cannot find God. That is its fundamental proposition. But that, you
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:22.160]   see, is being denied. Everything today is being governed and controlled by the philosophers
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.040]   and the thinkers. It is what they think about God and they define God and they make God
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   after their own image. And he is not God. He is an idol. Now, my argument is that as
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   long as this is the case, we have no right to talk about revival or to expect it, still
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:51.120]   less to hope for it. What is our final authority in all these matters? What do I know about
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:59.160]   God and the possibility of blessing, apart from what I have in this book? And do I claim
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.880]   that my mind and reason can select what is right in this and what is wrong in this, and
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   that I only hold on to what I happen to agree with? That makes me the authority, not this.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:17.240]   That makes my reason, not God's revelation. You go back and read the history of all the
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:23.120]   revivals of the past and you will find that there have been periods when men and women
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.600]   have believed this book to be the word of God. They have believed it literally. They
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.080]   have accepted it. They have regarded this as the revelation of God and the truth concerning
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:41.680]   him and men's relationship to him and all that is involved. And they believe that this
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.480]   book has been written by men who have been divinely inspired. They have submitted themselves
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.680]   to it. They have not stood above it as judges and as those who can decide what is right
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:05.560]   and what is wrong. The Philistines have been terribly active during the last 150 years.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.160]   And the conditions are as they are today because people have got no authority at all. They
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.760]   have denied the authority of the Scripture. They have set up their own opinions, philosophy,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:21.000]   science, learning, all these things. The supernatural element is discounted. Miracles are disbelieved
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   in. Science is supposed to be incompatible with them. All these things have been covered
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:37.120]   over. Any direct activity on the part of God is suspect because it does not fit into the
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:45.200]   systems of the philosophers. My dear friends, these are urgent matters. I plead with you,
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.000]   go back and read the history of the past. And I think you will discover that there has
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.840]   never been a revival when men have put their ideas and opinions before the authority of
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:02.400]   the word of God.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:13.960]   And that brings me to my next, which is this, the third great cardinal article of belief,
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:23.560]   Man in Sin and Under the Wrath of God. Here is a doctrine that the natural man hates,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:36.080]   detests, abominates. He feels it is insulting to him. He has always been like that. You
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.960]   go back again, I say, and read these histories and you will find in all those periods of
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.640]   deadness and of declension, people did not believe in sin in that way. They did not believe
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.480]   in the wrath of God. And I suppose there are no two things in connection with the Christian
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:57.600]   faith that are so abominated today as the doctrine of sin and the doctrine of the wrath
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:05.520]   of God. They are attempting to explain away sin in terms of psychology. They say it is
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.600]   insulting to mankind. And this idea of the wrath of God, why they say it is not God at
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.200]   all, that it is the tribal God of the Old Testament, as one prominent preacher put it
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.680]   not so long ago. He said he did not believe in that God of the Old Testament that sat
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:29.040]   on the top of Mount Sinai, shouting out his wrath and his condemnation. He said he believed
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:37.920]   in the God of Jesus. They say that the idea of the wrath of God is incompatible with the
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:46.880]   doctrine of God as love. Why am I calling these statements the work of the Philistines?
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:55.600]   For this reason, that the mere history of every revival brings this out immediately
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:02.560]   and on the very surface. That men and women in the midst of revival are conscious above
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:13.520]   everything of two things at first. One, their own unutterable sinfulness. When you have
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:22.200]   a revival you see men and women groaning, agonizing, under conviction of sin. They are
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.000]   so conscious of their unworthiness and their foulness and their vileness that they feel
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.240]   they cannot live. They do not know what to do with themselves. They cannot sleep. They
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.760]   are in an agony of soul. Read the history, my dear friends. That is the thing that comes
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.400]   out, the thing that is taught in the Bible, in other words, that the human heart is desperately
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:49.400]   wicked and deceitful. Who can know it? "In me," says the Apostle Paul, "that is to
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:55.280]   say in my flesh dwelleth no good thing, O wretched men that I am." Now in revival men
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:03.200]   and women feel their own sinfulness, their own unutterable unworthiness, their vileness,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.720]   their foulness, their perversion. They see it, they are horrified at it and cry out for
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   deliverance. But then that confronts them with the wrath of a holy God. And that is
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.720]   the cause of their intensest agony. They know they are deserving of this wrath and that
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.240]   God to be God must hate sin with all the intensity of his divine nature and being. And that he
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.640]   does so. He has said so in his word. It is in the Old Testament and in the New. The Jesus
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:42.680]   whom people put up against the Old Testament, he taught about the wrath of God. He spoke
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:48.160]   about hell. He spoke about the place where "the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched."
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.960]   It is he who uttered these thoughts. It is everywhere in the New Testament as well as
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:39:03.800]   in the Old. And I know of nothing that is so terrifying in the whole of the Bible as
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:11.280]   that statement there in that last book, in the book of Revelation, in chapter 6, which
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:18.040]   tells us of those men and women who at the end, when they will see him, will call to
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:26.440]   the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and to hide them from what? From the wrath
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:34.000]   of the Lamb? The wrath of the Lamb? The Lamb of God, the incarnation of his love? It is
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:47.880]   his wrath that is the most terrifying thing of all. That is what happens in every period
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:59.680]   of revival and of reawakening. Men quake in the presence of the living and the holy God.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.600]   And as they see their own sinfulness and unworthiness and vileness, they know not what to do nor
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:11.960]   where to turn. And there they are, perhaps in agony for days and days. That is what you
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:24.120]   get in revival, you know. And yet I just put it to you simply. Is not this the very truth
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:31.280]   that is being denied and hated and abominated at the present time? Isn't this the thing,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:36.240]   perhaps above all things, on which the Philistines have cast their earth and their refuse and
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:46.120]   their rubbish? I am not just contending for doctrines. God forbid that I should do so.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.720]   I am not anxious to strive. The very epistle I read at the beginning has told me not to
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.400]   strive. And I do not want to strive, but I am speaking with urgency because of this profound
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:05.200]   conviction I say again. That until men and women in the Christian church, I am talking
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.320]   to men and women in the Christian church, I am not thinking of those who are outside.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:19.480]   I say until men and women in the Christian church are humbled and abased and fall to
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:31.360]   the earth before this holy righteous yea to use the term of Jonathan Edwards, "angry
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:41.520]   people." I see no hope of revival. It is our arrogance. It is our pride. It is this
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:47.560]   tendency to set ourselves up and to define God after our own image, instead of falling
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:58.760]   and prostrating ourselves before him. It is that which stands between us and these mighty
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:07.960]   blessings. Well, my dear friends, our time has gone.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:14.360]   And I must need to come to an end this morning. I could go on. I am not halfway through the
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:19.960]   list of doctrines that I have to hold before you. But perhaps it is just as well that we
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:26.880]   leave it at this point for this occasion. Because if we have not this foundation, there
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:33.520]   is no point in proceeding. You see, it is not enough just to say, "You believe in
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:39.640]   the Lord Jesus Christ. I am coming on to the doctrine of his person and his work." But
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:49.360]   you cannot believe in him truly unless you start with that sovereign, transcendent, holy
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:57.040]   God who is and who acts, if you do not submit yourself entirely to the revelation that he
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:06.480]   has given, and if you are not aware of the plague of your own heart and the vileness
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:12.880]   and the foulness of the nature that you have inherited originally from Adam, if you do
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.480]   not turn to your hopelessness and your utter despair before this holy, righteous God who
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:29.200]   hates sin with the whole of his being. I say you have no right to talk about revival
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:39.360]   or to pray for it. What revival reveals above everything else is the sovereignty of God
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:50.280]   and the iniquity, the helplessness, the hopelessness of man in sin. May God give us grace to meditate
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.480]   upon these things. How do you think of God? How do you approach God? What is your attitude
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:03.280]   in his presence? Let us start with ourselves. This is personal. It is for every one of us.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.320]   In revival, God takes hold of unknown men that nobody has ever heard of, insignificant
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.160]   so-called members of the church, and it is through such people that he has often done
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.360]   his mightiest works. Who knows, it may be someone in this congregation whose name has
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:25.440]   never been heard, who may be the very instrument of God in the revival for which we long. Therefore,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:33.880]   I appeal to you one by one, consider these things. Are you clear about them? Is there
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:38.760]   any evidence of the work of the Philistines in your life and in your heart? If there is,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:48.080]   clear it out. Come back to these foundations. Amen.
