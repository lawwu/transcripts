[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560]   All right.
[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.840]   What do I got next?
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.960]   All right.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.320]   Next question is from Jay.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.280]   How do you choose what book to read next?
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.280]   Good question, Jay.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.000]   There's two main ways that books come onto my
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   radar of things I need to read.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   It's either functional.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.560]   So I need it for research.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.240]   Maybe I'm working on an article or I'm working
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.160]   on a book chapter and I need to read something
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.520]   because I need to know that information.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.200]   So there's functional ways that things come
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.120]   onto my list of things to read.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.720]   Everything else is inspirational.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.800]   That looks interesting.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.200]   Let's get that and read that as soon as possible
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.920]   after I get it.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.840]   So it's sort of like spontaneous or functional
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.200]   or inspirational and functional.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.960]   So I just looked here.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   I have four books I bought.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.120]   I bought four books in the last week.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.360]   So I thought I would just go through those
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.800]   and I'll for each let you know what the motivation was.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.400]   These are four books that hopefully I'll probably
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.840]   read these all within the next three or four weeks.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.560]   That'd be the idea.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.800]   So I bought First Man by James Hansen.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.000]   So James, it's a biography of Neil Armstrong.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200]   It's because I was watching Damon Chazelle's
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.760]   movie First Man, which by the way is underrated.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.600]   I think it's a fantastic movie, especially if
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.280]   you can watch it on a good screen with a good
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.320]   sound system.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.320]   I don't want to geek out about his use of 16
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840]   millimeter film and the cockpits.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.440]   And there's like a lot of really interesting
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.720]   decisions he makes.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.840]   It's Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy from The Crown,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.160]   whatever.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.000]   So I was watching this movie, which is great.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.520]   And I want to write, I want to read the book
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.240]   it's based off of.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.360]   So that was just inspiration.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.480]   Yeah, let's do this.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.320]   Karen Armstrong's new book, Sacred Nature.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.720]   I love Karen Armstrong's work.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.720]   I talked about the case for God and the history
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.320]   of God a lot on this podcast.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.200]   He has a new book out about the ways that people
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.480]   have found sacredness and nature throughout history.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.240]   I mean, of course I'm on board for that type of thing.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.080]   I saw that just mentioned in the New Yorkers
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   roundup of the best books of the year so far.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   Boom, just ordered that short book.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.280]   You know, I'll read it in a few days.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.080]   Very excited for that.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.760]   I also bought Super Intelligence by Nick Bostrom.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.120]   This is an AI ethics type book.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   It's for an article, right?
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.640]   So that's more like homework.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   I'm reading a chapter every morning of that.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.720]   And then there's 15 chapters.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.520]   I'm reading a chapter every morning as a baseline.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.000]   And then I'm going to throw in here and there
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.120]   extra sessions to read a couple more chapters here and there.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.160]   So I can get it done within 10 days would be nice.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.200]   And then I also just bought right before I came here,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.320]   John Meacham's new Lincoln biography.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.520]   I am a big, I'm a Lincoln fan.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   I read a lot of Lincoln stuff, but I'm particularly excited
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.560]   about Meacham's new biography for a lot of reasons.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.400]   I read a great review of it in the Washington Post
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.760]   book world this weekend.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.120]   And so that's on its way.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.840]   It's a big book.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.760]   I'll find time to read it.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   I want to get that done in November if I can as well.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.240]   So there you go.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.160]   It's a mix of inspiration and functionality.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.240]   And if I get inspired, I buy it.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.960]   I want to get into that book before the inspiration dies down.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.880]   When you're reading enough, you can get through a lot of books.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.480]   So on a given month, how many books do you read
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.600]   or how many books do you buy?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   Sorry.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.840]   I mean, five.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   So last week you bought a lot of your quota.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.600]   I have all I need for the next month, but sometimes I buy in books.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.040]   I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I need
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.360]   like this chapter and that chapter for an article
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.080]   or book research, like that's worth 25 bucks to me.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520]   If I can get a good example out of something, but yeah,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.760]   I bought a lot of my quota in a big burst.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.000]   And then you take trips to the library too
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.360]   every once in a while too, right?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.240]   And we have Little Free Libraries in my town.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.680]   They're really big.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.280]   My town is really big on these Little Free
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.320]   Libraries are everywhere.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.480]   And I get a lot of good books out of those.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.640]   It's just a take a book, leave a book type system.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.840]   Are those on the side of the road?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.480]   Okay.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.800]   I've seen them.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   Have you seen them to like, they look like mailboxes.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.480]   I walked by one.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.360]   You can, I mean, this is like Willy Wonka's
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.640]   factory for me, for my personality is this town.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.480]   It's like, just wander around and just pick up
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.240]   free books from these like well-educated peoples,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.080]   like their professors, Little Free Libraries,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.480]   and just walk around and just like pick up free books.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.840]   So when you're done picking up free books, go
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600]   to like one of our mini coffee shops to just
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.440]   sort of like sit and drink coffee and read.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.720]   And it's a cool town.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.160]   It's a good, it's a good match for me.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.120]   Though I should stop promoting it because we
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.640]   don't want too many more people to move here.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.760]   It's getting expensive.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.440]   So yeah.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.200]   Do not move here.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.400]   Helps your house value though.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.440]   It does help the house value.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   There's a cool town.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.680]   It's quaint.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.880]   It has a lot of books and good coffee shops.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.520]   That's all good.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.440]   Infested with werewolves.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.760]   So just, you know, caveat emptier, otherwise great.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.160]   Good books, good coffee.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.840]   You may have your flesh be devoured by a
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:05:01.600]   lichen trope, so you just got to balance that out.
