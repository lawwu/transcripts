[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   I think a lot of people don't realize is that you probably have access to a lot
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.360]   of other airline miles than what you know about.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.560]   So you might know you have American Airlines miles, but what you might not
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.840]   know is that your Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer to a bunch of different
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.480]   airline programs or your American Express Membership Rewards points can transfer
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.880]   to a number of different programs.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.920]   And I think a big part of what we're going to be talking about is these, how
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.480]   these flight search tools will tell you not just what award flights are available,
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.920]   but what program you can get those points from.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.840]   So you could transfer your Chase points over to Virgin Atlantic, let's say, in
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.800]   order to book an Air France flight.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.860]   And so that kind of complexity is something that a lot of people I think
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.840]   are afraid of, but these tools make it pretty easy to grasp, I think.
