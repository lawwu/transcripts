[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.200]   - What better day to relaunch the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.000]   than on January 11th of 2013,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.880]   a day which happens to also be John Piper's birthday.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.080]   Our aim is to connect you with Pastor John more frequently
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.480]   through these brief podcasts,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.440]   and you can stay tuned to the website DesiringGod.org
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.180]   and our Twitter and our Facebook feeds
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.720]   for more episodes as they come along in the future.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.240]   Today on your birthday, Pastor John,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.200]   we wanna hear from you because I know
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.040]   when birthdays and anniversaries come around,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.200]   you spend a lot of time thinking and reflecting
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.520]   and a lot of time in prayer.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.960]   And I wanna ask you, what is your prayer today
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.640]   on this, your 67th birthday?
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.900]   - My prayer is first, overflowing with thankfulness to God.
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.240]   I'm thankful for 67 years of physical life,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.680]   and they've been remarkably easy, I think,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.440]   from my standpoint compared to most people in the world.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.400]   I haven't, at least from my memory standpoint,
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   been all that sick.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.200]   I can remember times when it's been difficult,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.040]   but a relatively smooth 67 years.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.040]   I'm thankful for 61 years of life in Christ
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.080]   and his amazing faithfulness to me.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.920]   I'm thankful for 44 years with Noelle
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.360]   and her rock solid commitment to stand by me
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.440]   in everything.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.520]   I'm thankful for 32 1/2 years with my church.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520]   What a gift they've been to me.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.680]   I think I've gotten to know God more and people more
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.640]   in these 32 1/2 years than I ever could have
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   in any other path that he would have given me.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   I'm thankful for 40 years of parenting
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.520]   with the ups and downs and joys and sorrows of that.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   And thankful deeply for my five children
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.520]   who love me.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   Just got a beautiful email this morning
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.800]   from one of my kids just saying he loved me.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   (laughs)
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.760]   Really touches you pretty deeply.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.040]   So thankfulness is just big.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.600]   And then when I let it turn from thankfulness,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.480]   it becomes, God, don't let me waste the next chapter.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.400]   Everything feels like chapters right now, Tony,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.440]   because years don't seem to matter so much
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   as eras right now for me.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.400]   I'm finishing at Bethlehem.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.120]   I'm gonna finish 67 years.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.440]   And so right now, it doesn't just look like
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.360]   I'm facing a year.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.680]   It looks like I'm facing an era if God gives me life.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.560]   And so I'd say, God, don't let me waste this.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.480]   And grant that your name would be hallowed through my life,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.280]   that your kingdom would come through my life,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.800]   that your will would be done through my life.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.680]   I wanna spread a passion for your supremacy, oh Lord,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.360]   and all things for the joy of all peoples
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.880]   So keep me on task and don't let me fritter my life away.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.120]   - Looking back over the previous chapters
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.520]   of your life now at age 67,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.060]   are there things that surprise you?
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.680]   I imagine there's a lot of things that surprise you.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.520]   - Oh, my.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.600]   (laughs)
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.480]   I was, as a kid, I was just so insecure
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   and so pimple-faced and nervous and socially maladapted.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.640]   And I mean, if you had asked me
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   that I would have spoken to passion (laughs)
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.520]   to 62,000 students, I would have said,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.320]   yeah, if the sun stops in the sky and the ocean dries up,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.540]   I might be able to do that.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.540]   So my present role as a preacher to a church every week
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.380]   and to groups around the country,
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.860]   that's just unheard of.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.780]   It's just, I didn't plan that.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.620]   It wasn't on the agenda.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.460]   People would ask me,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.140]   "You gonna be a preacher like your dad?"
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.700]   And I'd say, "No way, I can't begin
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.020]   "to be a preacher like my dad."
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.020]   So my whole vocational trajectory is a surprise to me.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.660]   And then writing started to be a love for me
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.420]   in the 11th grade, ironically.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.540]   I didn't read until the 11th grade, hardly.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.500]   I hated to read.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.260]   I'd rather be outside throwing a ball
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.780]   or digging in the dirt.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.020]   And suddenly, Mrs. Clanton, I don't know what she did
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.860]   in the 11th grade literature class,
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.700]   but wow, something just locked in on me
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.620]   for her poetry and writing and reading.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.620]   And so from my gut, it doesn't surprise me
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.940]   that I'm a writer.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.820]   From my gut, it does surprise me
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.900]   that my books have sold
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.860]   and that people care to read them.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.420]   That, I've always written.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.460]   It's written for journals
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.740]   and written for my own birthday poems
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.780]   for my family and things,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.580]   but that I would be a writer and a preacher,
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.380]   those two things are surprising to me.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.460]   - Pastor John, how can we be praying for you
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.940]   as this new chapter of your life
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.500]   and your ministry now unfolds?
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.820]   - I really do feel remarkably vulnerable
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.540]   to distraction
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.500]   because of the lifting of certain pressures.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.460]   Deadlines are wonderfully productive
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.420]   and pressure, while we hate it, really does help us.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.940]   And so living a life in the ministry
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.980]   where every week you must preach
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.020]   and every Tuesday you must lead the staff
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.020]   and every time a retreat comes around,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.100]   you must have a plan.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.700]   And the pressures of the last 32 years
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.140]   have been wonderfully productive, effective.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.980]   Now those pressures begin to lift
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.980]   and I need to adjust my internal motivational powers
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.060]   and God needs to give me the grace
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.060]   to have my own intrinsic personal resolves
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.700]   to set kinds of goals for myself
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.140]   and patterns of life for myself
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.980]   so that I can continue to be fruitful
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.940]   and not wasteful of my time
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.340]   because I can taste it.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.620]   I can just taste that it's easy to drift
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.260]   when you don't have deadlines.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.340]   So I think I would just pray that spiritually
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.900]   I wouldn't be a drifter
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.620]   and that productively I wouldn't be a drifter.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.260]   But spiritually, I mean, I wanna go hard after God
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.620]   in this new season.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.980]   You know, what strikes me about retirement,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.380]   the way the world conceives of it
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.500]   is that generally things are recommended
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.260]   that are pretty poor ways of getting ready
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.500]   to meet King Jesus.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.580]   And it seems to me that the closer we're getting to Jesus,
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.940]   the more we should be devoted to him
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.500]   in focused ways of fellowship and communion.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.420]   So my own personal aggressiveness in spiritual life,
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.580]   I wanna go hard after Jesus in my devotions
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.780]   and hard after Jesus so that I know him better
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.380]   and better through his words
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.380]   so that when I die, the transition won't be abrupt.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.940]   You know, it won't be surprising.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.980]   When I look at him, I'll say,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.100]   you're pretty much what I saw in the word of God
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.260]   and came to love in the word of God.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.220]   I don't have to be now radically adjusted
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.620]   in my way of seeing him.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.500]   - Well, on behalf of your listeners
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.940]   and readers of your books from around the globe,
