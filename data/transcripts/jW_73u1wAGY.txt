[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940]   It's important for a translation team to be committed to
[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.620]   inerrancies because you want to know what God meant to say.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.580]   So by having the word for word translation, it helps the
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.380]   preacher or any Bible student to be able to understand what the
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.860]   words were originally.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.300]   Where a dynamic translation, you're kind of, it's almost like
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.940]   a commentary at times where you're dependent upon the
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.300]   translator's interpretation of what the words meant and there's
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.380]   only one intended meaning as we know.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.180]   Obviously countless of Holy Spirit applications in your
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.100]   life but the idea is what did the author intend to say to the
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.740]   original audience when you wrote it.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.620]   And that's where you get the word for word translation which
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.260]   helps out tremendously for a preacher or anybody who's
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.580]   serious about studying the Bible.
