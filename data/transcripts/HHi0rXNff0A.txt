[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.520]   - Happy Good Friday, or so we call it.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.920]   It is a joyful day, even if it is the most solemn day
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.660]   in the church calendar.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.500]   And we talked about reckoning the repulsion
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.480]   and the delight of the cross last time.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.840]   Today we talk about one of the little stories
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.460]   of the crucifixion narrative, Pastor John,
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.500]   specifically the figure of Simon of Cyrene.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.720]   A listener to the podcast writes us about it.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.320]   Hello, Pastor John, reading through the story
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.320]   of the crucifixion this week.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.760]   Something caught my attention
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.320]   that I'd read over many times.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.960]   In Luke 23, 26, in the midst of the crucifixion event,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.880]   we read this, "And as they led Jesus away,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.720]   they seized one Simon of Cyrene,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.320]   who was coming in from the country
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.200]   and laid on him the cross to carry it behind Jesus."
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.640]   I know that God is sovereign,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880]   and therefore this was not an accident
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.720]   or a random detail added into the story.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.060]   What's the significance of Simon carrying Jesus' cross?
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.440]   What does God want us to see here?
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   This was really good for me to think about
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.400]   because I've read that a hundred times
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.380]   and have not paused like so many of these questions
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.440]   force me to do, and that's really valuable.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.180]   Sometimes when authors are reporting facts,
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.120]   like this is a fact,
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.420]   sometimes when they report facts in their narrative,
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.760]   they give us clear clues and pointers
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.280]   why they are including those facts
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.200]   and what they want us to learn from them.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   I don't see really clear, decisive clues here
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.240]   or in any of the gospels
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800]   for why the gospel writers include this fact.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.900]   One of the reasons for that
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.680]   may be that Simon, who carried the cross,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.260]   may have become a well-known presence in the early church
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.200]   so that the mere reference to his name
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.560]   functions as just another historical evidence.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   This man right there that you know,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.280]   he carried the cross.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.000]   And the reason I say that is because in Mark 15, 21,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.880]   Simon is called the father of Alexander and Rufus.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.560]   Like, that's an unusual piece of information.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.760]   I mean, it would be very odd for Mark to put that in
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.000]   unless he expected his readers
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.860]   to know who Alexander and Rufus was.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.820]   And Mark is sometimes associated with Peter
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.060]   as a gospel writer,
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.560]   and Peter is associated with Rome,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.900]   and in Romans 16, there's a man named Rufus.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660]   So there are little things like that
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.460]   that cause people to say,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.780]   okay, this is an allusion to a man
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.020]   that everybody in the church knew.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.300]   He had become something of a known person,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.040]   and so you didn't have to say anything about him.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.240]   You said, he's the one who carried the cross.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.960]   You can go talk to him and ask him what it was like.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.880]   But I suspect that in Luke's mind,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.880]   there was more going on than merely a historical link
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.100]   between the crucifixion and a person
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.280]   who was known as the father of Alexander and Rufus.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.920]   So let me make some suggestions,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.600]   and that's really all they are,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.100]   and I'm willing to make them as suggestions
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.960]   rather than pronouncements of certainties that I see,
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.120]   because it may be that those who listen to me
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.140]   could see more than I see
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.940]   and make one of these suggestions move towards,
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.360]   oh, that really was intended by Luke.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.080]   So I'm giving you homework to do, kind of.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.240]   So number one suggestion.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   Simon is described as from Cyrene.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.360]   That's a city in North Africa, today's Libya.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.000]   We don't know if he was Jewish or Gentile
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.080]   because the name Simon was common for Greeks and Jews.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.560]   We don't know if he was visiting Jerusalem or lived there,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.160]   but what we know is that the gospel draw attention
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   to this man's got a foreign origin.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.960]   He's an African.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.760]   So Luke might say, let it be noted
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   that a foreigner served Jesus in his final hour,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.240]   indeed an African.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.280]   There's suggestion number one.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.680]   Number two, Luke is the only one of the gospels
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.480]   that says Simon carried the cross behind Jesus.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.560]   All the other gospels that mention this
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.460]   say he just carried it.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.320]   Does Luke want us to remember Luke 9.23,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.360]   where he said, "If anyone would come after me,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.240]   In other words, is Luke suggesting to us
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.520]   this is a picture of what discipleship is.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.080]   Number three, if we think that Luke was pointing
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   to this event as a parable of discipleship,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.280]   like I just suggested,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.640]   could the fact that Joseph was chosen so suddenly
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.240]   and unexpectedly for the heavy task
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.680]   be Luke's way of teaching us
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.280]   that we don't always choose the moment of our cross bearing.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.600]   We don't always choose the moment of our suffering.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.440]   They come upon us in unexpected ways,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.800]   frightening ways, heavy ways, painful ways,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.080]   seemingly random ways.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.180]   In other words, the fact that Simon
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.400]   was chosen seemingly randomly,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.240]   I mean, it just says he was coming in from the field.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.600]   He was coming in from the country.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.920]   That little added note seems to say,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.240]   "This is random, you think."
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.560]   A lesson that every moment of our lives,
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.480]   coming in from the country,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   we should be ready to be snatched into the service of Jesus
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.880]   in a painful way, and we just don't know when, maybe.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.120]   Number four suggestion.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.340]   I think most people would assume
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.740]   that demanding someone else to carry Jesus' cross
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.160]   means he was at the breaking point,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   too weak to finish the trek on his own.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.100]   But what we may not think about as quickly
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.020]   is whether this act by the authorities,
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.220]   maybe the soldiers, this decision to get Simon to help
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.220]   was an act of compassion or cruelty or simple expediency.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.460]   Here's what I mean.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.040]   If he couldn't carry his cross,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.520]   somebody had to because these soldiers are charged,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.360]   "Crucify him."
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.620]   And if they let him die on the way,
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.760]   somebody's gonna be ticked, right?
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.640]   So maybe just pure expediency,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.000]   "Gotta get this man up there to get him crucified."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.720]   Or it might have been a moment of compassion
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.700]   from one of the Roman soldiers.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.500]   Or, this is what I had not realized,
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.980]   Matthew Henry suggests it may be that they saw
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.560]   Jesus was about to die under the burden
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.100]   and they were so bloodthirsty
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.620]   or fearful of punishment from Pilate
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.320]   that they wanted to make sure he survived
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.000]   for the remaining torture.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.660]   In other words, just the opposite of compassion.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.020]   We've gotta get nails through his hands
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.100]   and nails through his feet.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.940]   We can't let this man just die here of exhaustion
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.460]   under his cross.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.060]   Number five, fifth suggestion, one more.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.860]   Only Luke tells us that in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.860]   Jesus is in agony and was helped by an angel as he prayed.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.220]   In Luke 22, 43, an angel came and helped him,
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.100]   sustained him, gave him strength.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.100]   In Hebrews 5, 7, it says,
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.380]   "Jesus offered up prayers and supplications
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.400]   "with loud cries and tears to him
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.980]   "who was able to save him from death."
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.900]   And he was heard, he was heard because of his reverence,
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.900]   his godly fear.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.120]   Now, how does that work?
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.460]   He prayed that God would save him from death
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.540]   and he was heard.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.980]   Well, he died.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.900]   So I've argued in an article at Desiring God
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   that Jesus was saved from death in answer to his cry,
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.940]   not in the sense that he didn't die,
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.060]   but in the sense that he was saved
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.140]   from the faith-destroying powers of death.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.220]   In other words, death loomed in front of him
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.460]   and he was a human being and death was so horrible
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.620]   that it could have deterred him from obedience.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.180]   And he pleaded with his father,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.020]   "Don't let death destroy me like that."
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.020]   And an angel came and helped him.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   So what he was praying was not that he wouldn't die,
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.860]   but that the horrors of suffering and death
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.300]   wouldn't deter him from his obedience
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.380]   and his saving mission.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   Could it be then that Simon's stepping in to help Jesus
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.100]   make it to the cross, help Jesus just at that moment
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.860]   was like the angel showing up at the perfect moment
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.860]   just when the humanly weak Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.460]   and now on the road to the cross
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.300]   needed help to finish his mission.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.300]   So whichever of these five, six suggestions,
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.540]   whatever are part of Luke's intention as he writes,
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.220]   what we know is this.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.460]   Number one, Simon was a real historical person
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.180]   and he was there at a real historical moment.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.940]   Number two, he was a foreigner, an African,
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.020]   who served Jesus in his final hour.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.180]   Three, carrying the cross behind Jesus
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.380]   is a beautiful and painful picture of our calling
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.460]   as disciples according to Luke 9.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.100]   Whether Luke intended us to see that or not, it's true.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.820]   Four, the call to suffer for Jesus is often sudden
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.860]   and costly and seemingly random.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.860]   Five, Simon's help proved to be both a relief temporarily,
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.980]   but also added suffering because it sustained Jesus
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.220]   to get to the cross and have the horrible experience
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.820]   of crucifixion for us.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.820]   And six, we know that Jesus cried out to his heavenly father
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.260]   in Gethsemane that he be given help.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.300]   He needed help so that his obedience would not falter
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.740]   and God answered his prayers.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.740]   These were the hardest hours of Jesus' life.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.980]   And as we meditate on all these details,
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.980]   oh, what love, what thankfulness should rise in our hearts.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.060]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.940]   Lots of rich connections here for our reflection.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.740]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.100]   And thank you for listening to search our several years
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.220]   of archives to read transcripts of episodes
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.460]   or to ask a question of your own,
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.460]   go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.420]   Well, what an incredible weekend ahead for us.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.140]   Friday, we celebrate the cross of Christ.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.820]   Sunday, we celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.740]   And then of course we return to our normal lives
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.860]   and our daily routines on Monday.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.340]   For many of us, we return back to those normal daily
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.500]   routines, so how do we carry the joy of Easter Sunday
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.940]   into our Monday mornings?
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.540]   That question is on Monday.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.620]   When we return, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.980]   Have a wonderful Easter weekend celebrating
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.600]   our glorious savior.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.760]   (upbeat music)
