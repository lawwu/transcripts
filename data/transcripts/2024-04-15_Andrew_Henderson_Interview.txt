[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.040]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today I'm joined
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.600]   by Andrew Henderson of Knowbad Capitalist.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.440]   Andrew, welcome.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.160]   - It's good to see you here in Bogota, Colombia.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.480]   Andrew, I am an enormous admirer
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.960]   of your entrepreneurial journey.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.520]   I was a financial advisor for years
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.260]   and I had this idea that somehow,
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.240]   if I could just teach people to buy stocks
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   and fund their retirement plans, they would become wealthy.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.860]   And then over time, I learned that that wasn't actually true
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.880]   but in reality, the people who became wealthy
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.800]   were those who built either a large income
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.200]   or a large business.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.760]   And having been a close follower of yours over many years,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.200]   you've done exactly that.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.560]   I'd love to hear a little bit of background
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.800]   on your entrepreneurial journey,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.620]   especially how you've grown over the years to run,
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.820]   how big is Knowbad Capitalist now?
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.360]   - We've got about 70 people.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.200]   - Amazing.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.560]   - We got into the, I mean, I guess, multi-figure company.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.240]   And what I'm really excited about now
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.280]   is we put in place a vision,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.840]   not to reduce the number of Americans and North Americans
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.280]   that we have as clients and as guests of the event
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.400]   that I know you're gonna be speaking at,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.160]   Knowbad Capitalist Live,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.040]   but to focus all of our efforts
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.640]   on growing all the other markets.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.040]   And so the big thing we've been doing in the last,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.520]   probably close to 12 months,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.600]   is getting people from Turkey, getting people from Brazil,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.920]   getting people from Vietnam and like all over the world.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160]   I mean, clientele from all over the world,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.440]   from race car drivers to tech startup guys who IPO'd,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.560]   to people who sold businesses.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.760]   And it's been incredible.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.680]   And it shows me what's been really exciting
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.520]   is you have guys in Vietnam
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.320]   with a hundred million dollars, self-made guys.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.160]   - Amazing.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.080]   - And they're much, what's very interesting
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.760]   for our point of view is they're much more in demand
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.040]   with banks and investment opportunities
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.200]   because they're from places that are much less regulated
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.840]   than let's say an American.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.920]   And so for me, the journey is I come from the United States.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.140]   I left the United States long ago.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.980]   I haven't been back.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.680]   And fortunately we're here in Bogota
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.120]   where there's lots of construction and things are happening.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.000]   But no, that's been the journey.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.480]   And I ran a business,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.000]   a couple of businesses in the United States
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   for close to a decade before I left.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.700]   And that was instructional.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.760]   But I think that 100X the experience
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.880]   when you're hiring across different cultures,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.560]   when you're doing business across cultures,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   when you're working while traveling
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.920]   and you have different homes,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.180]   this is like learning how to run a business on steroids.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.380]   - When you began in business,
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.440]   you were an entrepreneur from a very early age.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.760]   Went to college, dropped out to run a business.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.920]   What was your primary motivation
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.440]   in pursuing the entrepreneurial path?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.280]   - I never liked the backstory idea.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.720]   A lot of people have the backstory.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.760]   It seems very well-tuned.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.580]   I think that some of the great entrepreneurs,
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.980]   it's a calling, it's almost a sickness, really.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.280]   And I think that you're gonna see that eventually come out
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.000]   with this kind of new generation.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   I don't know about you, but when I was growing up,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.600]   it's like, you wanna be an entrepreneur?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.120]   Girls looked at you weird,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.840]   and guys kind of made fun of you.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.480]   That's kind of like, what?
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.040]   Like, you're gonna be like Bill Gates or something?
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.980]   That guy's weird.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.520]   Now it's cool.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.120]   And I think that too many people are doing it
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.500]   because they have this idea that it is what it's not.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.760]   It's tough.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.840]   And I was just watching Howard Schultz over the weekend
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.080]   on an interview, a founder of Starbucks.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.880]   I was watching the guy who basically formed
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.040]   all the hotels that became Marriott.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.520]   They even, as multibillionaires,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.060]   have some very serious issues.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.720]   If you're gonna get past that,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160]   you've gotta be nuts to a certain extent.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.360]   And I don't know that I ever thought about it.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.700]   I don't look at a lot of things as risky as most people do,
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.720]   but I never even considered the risk profile
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.360]   of starting a business at 19 years old.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.200]   I just didn't.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.360]   I just said, I have to do.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.200]   Do, do, do.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.640]   My father says, American football.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.400]   Analogy is to block and tackle.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.800]   And that's what I did.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.620]   - You began in the radio business, right?
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.800]   How, was that something that you had contact with,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.040]   or how did that idea come to you?
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.940]   - My father was in business,
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.440]   but his side hustle was on the radio.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.880]   So we had a show when I was between eight and 13.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.360]   He was like the guy after Rush Limbaugh, where we grew up.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.840]   And he had the money show.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.640]   Back in the day when radio stations
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.680]   were more of a public service,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.040]   you'd have one company that went on eight radio stations,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.560]   two in Cleveland, two in Milwaukee,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.760]   two somewhere else, two somewhere else.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   And he got 500 clients for his financial services business
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.300]   from a radio show.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.100]   They paid him to do the radio show.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.480]   Well, over time, radio consolidation came into play.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.700]   You had more licenses issued.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.660]   There's something like 13,000 radio stations
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.160]   in the US, the peak.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.340]   And so you had a lot of radio stations that were failing,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.780]   like little AM stations that didn't have the great power.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.780]   They didn't have this historical thing.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   And they went into kind of the paid programming model.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.260]   And so I found an opportunity.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.060]   I kind of did some work at night
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.700]   for some guys who were doing that locally,
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.900]   kind of learned their systems.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.700]   They had a pretty good marketing system.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.740]   And they said, how do I expand this
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.060]   on a more national basis to work with radio stations
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.980]   that are in the dumps?
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.300]   So we'd go into somewhere in California,
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.680]   they're making $10,000 a month.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.060]   They can barely pay the rent.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.720]   They go up to $60,000 a month.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.780]   We kind of change things around.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.100]   And so we did that all over the country.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.220]   That's where I kind of got the, I still love radio.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.100]   I'm still, I'm probably the foremost.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.220]   I probably think more than any other living human being
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   about American radio legal IDs and imaging.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.500]   I still think about it to this day.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.180]   And it's taught me a lot about marketing
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.620]   and branding and all that,
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.580]   and just kind of what things look like.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.580]   But that's how I get into it.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.140]   And ultimately it's a dying business,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.260]   but it was something that ultimately,
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.820]   I mean, you went on to work with some very big names
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.620]   in the direct marketing space, televangelists,
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.020]   people selling health products.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.660]   I mean, it was nice to help out struggling stations.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.480]   I enjoyed being in the business,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.700]   even though it's kind of like these stations
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.740]   are not putting out the best programming.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.060]   But ultimately I just said to myself,
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.500]   I don't want to be in the US.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.580]   And I just, I mean, radio is a sinking ship now.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.460]   It's just, I mean, it's terrible.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.940]   I had a friend who just bought a radio station
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.540]   for $50,000 in Chicago.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.940]   - You were still running that business
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.540]   when you started expatriating
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.180]   or your process of expatriating?
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.580]   - I pretty much got out of it in like 2012.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.180]   So I've been traveling a lot.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.620]   And so my initial thought when I started,
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.900]   block and tackle, 2006, I had a Vonage phone.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.620]   Remember Vonage, this voiceover IP phone?
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.660]   And I said, I could just take this phone with me
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.220]   and plug it in anywhere in the world.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.940]   Why am I here?
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.820]   And I think a year or two later I started traveling
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.620]   and it just became a lot, a lot, a lot more
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.820]   to where I was often traveling.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.900]   I remember one time I went to Beijing for three weeks
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.860]   and I had a partner on a project.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.820]   And I said, I'm gonna go and like see if he notices
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.660]   that I'm not even there
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.820]   'cause I'll just work at night and all that.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.920]   And so I had been traveling a lot.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.180]   I kind of saw like, you know,
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.260]   this radio business is gonna get tougher.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.820]   I had got a side hustle business.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.820]   I had a couple of side hustles.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.260]   The biggest, most successful was a swimming pool business
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.020]   that was kind of like, I need this service.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.340]   I'll just, all right, sell me a business.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.540]   I'll build it up and I'll sell it.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.500]   And so everything was kind of like,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.300]   I wanted to get in everything
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.340]   and I wanted to move full time.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.060]   I think I had the same problems
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.620]   that a lot of entrepreneurs have
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.820]   where they have a business they don't have to be there for,
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.380]   but they kind of feel compelled.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.580]   Even now, what I've had to avoid with Nomad Capitalist
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.820]   is I'll feel compelled to sit in front of the laptop
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.180]   for 14 hours a day, like waiting for the next email.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.460]   You just feel that kind of sense of anxiety,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.700]   like something could need my attention.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.140]   And I think that was probably,
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.340]   other than the aforementioned reasons,
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.780]   why I just kind of wanted to get out of those
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.500]   and kind of start fresh.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.740]   I saw the potential of having a business
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.740]   that did not rely on the United States.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.580]   And so in 2013, I kind of left for good.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.820]   And that's kind of when I was writing Nomad Capitalist.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.500]   So I would write articles about my experiences
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.420]   and the rest is history.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.220]   - Didn't you begin doing articles before that though?
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.220]   - End of 2012.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.540]   So I think I left shortly after
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.620]   I started writing the article.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.340]   - Nothing in about 2009 or so?
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.180]   - No.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.020]   - Okay.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.900]   I thought that I had first come across your brand then,
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.820]   but I first came across your brand when it was very early.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.740]   But at that time, it wasn't a business.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.020]   It was a personal passion project, right?
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.500]   - Yeah, and it was, honestly,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.100]   a reflection of living in the US.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.700]   And I think this is probably would be even worse now.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.920]   There was more anger.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.420]   There was more kind of, to the entrepreneurial point,
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.760]   I worked in radio.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.940]   I had all these talk radio stations that I dealt with.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.500]   They would invite me on the listener cruise
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.420]   or come and meet Bill O'Reilly and Laura Ingraham
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.260]   kind of thing.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.540]   They're giving a speech where the station, whatever.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.620]   And you'd see a lot of these people
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.780]   and you'd see like 65 year old people
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.280]   who maybe they accumulated some money.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.300]   Maybe they were like your clients.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.140]   They made some good,
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.460]   they built up their wealth in the stock market kind of thing.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.340]   But there wasn't a shred of happiness in their lives.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.080]   If they had more construction in their lives,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.880]   they probably would have been a lot happier.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.720]   But I said to myself, some of these talk radio listeners,
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.600]   these kind of libertarians,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.340]   I might agree with the libertarians,
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.160]   but honestly, the worst thing that could ever happen to them
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.880]   is that they become happy.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.760]   And I just said to myself,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.500]   that was kind of the frame that I was in to some extent,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.380]   maybe a little bit more self-aware of it.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.220]   But it was like, yeah,
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.720]   the US government does a lot of bad stuff
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.560]   and they're nasty.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.700]   Like, why do you want to support them?
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.540]   And why do you want to live there?
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.000]   And why do you want to travel on their passport?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.800]   And I think that it was, I mean,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.160]   certainly I've had some cultural clashes
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.480]   in some places that I've gone.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.040]   I'm still a pretty intense person.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.600]   I'd say I'm a relatively demanding person
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.880]   by everyone's standards.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.060]   But I think there's a lot more peace
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.400]   being able to say that for me,
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   it was a place I didn't feel comfortable.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.800]   And now I'm not there anymore.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.900]   And I think there's a lot of people
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.880]   who are sitting in the US
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.160]   or maybe other Western countries.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.600]   There's young men that feel like
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.560]   just being a man is toxic.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.040]   And listen, there's some stuff that men have done
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.640]   that is toxic, but just being a man's not toxic.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.600]   And I would imagine it's a hell of a lot worse now
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.120]   to be sitting in a Western country
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.800]   and feeling like I don't feel at peace here.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.520]   And to me, the answer was,
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.720]   and you can see it over the course
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.840]   of how I've evolved over time,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.200]   maybe I've just gotten older too,
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.520]   but there's been a lot more nuance to that
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.720]   where you realize if you want to be successful,
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.880]   you're not gonna do it by sitting around
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.520]   and complaining about the government.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.680]   And if you want to be happy,
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   you're not gonna do it by sitting around
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.580]   and complaining about the government
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.400]   or complaining about the soup you're sitting in.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.440]   Now more than ever,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.600]   you can change the soup that you're sitting in.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.800]   - Yeah, I noticed that I was an early consumer
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.640]   of your podcast.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.600]   And back in about 2016, 2017,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.120]   I listened to your back catalog
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.800]   on both of the audio podcasts that you used to have.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.560]   So I heard the transition
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.960]   from the frustrated, angry version of Andrew Henderson
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.880]   to the peaceful, more relaxed Andrew Henderson.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   In my own expatriation journey,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.640]   I had a similar experience
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.760]   that when I was in the United States,
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.880]   I felt enormous frustration, enormous anger.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.520]   As I started leaving the country systematically,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.640]   I felt more relaxed.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.920]   When I first got my first, second passport,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.480]   I felt enormous peace when I realized I could,
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.320]   I haven't done it,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.000]   but I could separate myself from this country
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.120]   and it brought me an enormous amount of peace.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.240]   - And I try and tell people that.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.160]   We've made 2,600 videos.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.800]   Even people, again, Nomad Capitalist Live is coming up.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.720]   Even if you come to that,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.520]   even if you spend four days with us,
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.240]   this year in Kuala Lumpur again,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.880]   I don't know that you'll entirely get it
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   until you've done something,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.760]   which is why I tell people,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.440]   if you wanna experience this,
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.200]   one thing you can do is just get a bank account
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.400]   in a country like Georgia with $1
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.560]   and then you're like six months later,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   oh yeah, I have that dollar somewhere.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.840]   Oh, it's still there.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.960]   Like, oh, it's not only my country where the money's safe.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.880]   Like doing something gives you that sense of fulfillment.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.720]   But yeah, no, I think there's been
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.920]   tremendous personal growth
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.800]   because if you go to a therapy setting,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.320]   what is anger?
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.400]   It's the response to a feeling of powerlessness.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.320]   I think a lot of people feel powerless these days
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.680]   for different reasons.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.880]   Now, for people like us who just wanna be left alone
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.080]   and we think that we've worked hard
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.720]   and built something and created value,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.080]   we don't wanna give half our money away
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.400]   to a certain government.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   There's other people who feel powerless
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.000]   that some of the opportunities,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.480]   I mean, you can't live in the United States.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.360]   Everyone talks about it.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   It's not the '80s.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.920]   You have one job.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.720]   Guy only graduated high school.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.800]   Spouse stays at home.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.600]   Three kids, nice house.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.680]   Three cars.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.800]   It's not really doable anymore.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.960]   Some of those people feel powerlessness.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.840]   I don't think the answer is take a bunch of money
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.600]   from people who are already paying half their income,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.280]   but they feel powerlessness.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.160]   That's the reaction.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.000]   I think that guys like us have felt that in some regard.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.360]   So how do you do that?
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.800]   Number one, you have to be attuned to the power
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.920]   that you have and understand what that is.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.760]   But number two, you find a way to take back the power.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.360]   And I don't care if it's a dating situation.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.680]   I don't care if that's a business situation,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.400]   a tax situation, any kind of situation.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.600]   You find a way to take that back.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.760]   And I think that geographical solutions
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.800]   are some of the most easily implemented
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.520]   because you're not waiting for anybody else to change.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.880]   You're just going where you're treated best,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.200]   as I would say.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.640]   - I'd like to talk about your investment journey
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.320]   because you not only have experience in the United States,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.200]   your father was a financial advisor.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.780]   You also have experience looking for investments
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.620]   around the world.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.440]   You've invested in real estate
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.920]   in at least half a dozen countries.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.280]   You've invested in many markets.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.760]   And then you also have an enormous amount
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.680]   of business experience and business success,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.360]   which has been, as far as I can tell,
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.280]   what you've shared publicly,
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   your largest source of revenue.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.400]   And you've developed a unique investment model
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.880]   based upon that.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.960]   So when you think about investing,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.300]   how do you guide people through that process?
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.160]   Given that you have four distinct opportunities,
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.720]   put money in my IRA,
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.580]   buy a piece of real estate in another country,
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.480]   build a business, build,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.600]   even recently you spoke about a dividend stock portfolio.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.680]   What is your model for the progression
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.840]   through that wealth building plan?
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.400]   - I think the first thing I did was I realized
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.880]   that here's a problem that entrepreneurs have,
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   maybe other people have too,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.800]   but entrepreneurs have, I'm good at this thing,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.320]   so I'm good at everything.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.720]   When we first started the services at Nomad Capitalist,
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.800]   'cause people started asking me for help,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.080]   I put a little package together.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.160]   You can buy a plan, we'll make it.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.000]   And that plan's evolved.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.320]   I think it's the best service of its kind now.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.480]   But back in the early days,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.040]   we got a lot of kind of the hotshot young guys
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.440]   who could barely afford it,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.680]   but they were very confident.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.760]   Like, I don't really need your help.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   I'll figure out this company.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.940]   And then they call you back a year later,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.240]   like, oh, I got the company open,
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.680]   but now I can't process credit cards.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.120]   And I've basically done nothing.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.920]   And it's cost me half a million dollars in taxes.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.240]   And I probably should've just hired you.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.120]   In the same vein, I said to myself,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.200]   I think I see macro trends
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.640]   because I'm divorced from the dogma of any country.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.480]   So, you know, Bank of Georgia stock,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.820]   it's up like 109% in the last year.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.480]   I got in somewhere in the middle of that
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.000]   because I said, you know,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.520]   this is a good dividend paying stock,
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.400]   but it's a great growth stock as well.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.800]   You know, like all the metrics.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.380]   This is a company that's gonna do well.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.220]   I know it.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.480]   Kind of a Peter Lynch philosophy.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.320]   I know it.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.220]   I think it's the best bank in Georgia today.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.360]   It'll do well.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.040]   And, you know, I'm not a stock picker.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.680]   We don't help people pick stocks.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.840]   But anyway, so the point is I'm an entrepreneur first.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.540]   I'm an investor because I have investments,
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.860]   not because I'm a great investor.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.240]   I have friends who are the exact opposite.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.400]   They're not great entrepreneurs.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.320]   Maybe they started a business,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.720]   they hire one or two people,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.280]   but they're great traders.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.680]   I think you have to pick one or the other.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.520]   So for me, I looked at it as my growth stock is my business.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.640]   That's the ultimate growth stock.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.680]   I mean, we can bring in certain people
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   and they'll figure out,
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.560]   unfortunately in our business, maybe not to huge scale,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.960]   we can get a 20-fold return on $10,000 a month
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.080]   and spend on something.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.960]   And then you can go over there
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.120]   and do something a little bit different.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.600]   You can get 15 X on 20 grand.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.160]   Like, that's better than buying Nvidia
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.280]   'cause you're in control.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.120]   Right.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.240]   And that scales a lot better.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.640]   So that was the growth stock.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.520]   For me, you know, for any stocks, I look for yield.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.720]   I look for tax-friendly yield.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.800]   I'm not a US citizen.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.360]   So if I go to Hong Kong or Singapore
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.520]   and there's no dividend tax
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.840]   and there's no capital gains tax,
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.520]   I don't have dividend tax or capital gains tax.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.360]   So, you know, 6% on DBS Bank
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.200]   looks better than, you know, 5% on a US REIT
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.480]   where I'm paying 30% because of my structure.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.000]   And so I think that, you know,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.920]   I think you're gonna see,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.480]   I believe you're gonna see a lot more growth
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.880]   in other parts of the world.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.160]   I believe in owning personal real estate.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.760]   So I have a number of properties around the world.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.280]   To me, it's like a nice hedge.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.480]   It's not zeros and ones on a computer.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.160]   It's property in the ground.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.240]   It's more secure.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.600]   You know, I'm a believer to some extent in gold,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.680]   have some Bitcoin.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.040]   I mean, I think it's kind of a whole diversification play
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.800]   because, you know, Warren Buffett would say,
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.320]   "Don't diversify."
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   I was never interested.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.120]   Maybe you can help me explain.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.960]   Berkshire Hathaway is a very diversified
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.440]   collection of companies.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.680]   I mean, just say, "Oh, I buy Berkshire.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.520]   "I have one stock.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.800]   "I don't diversify."
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.880]   I think you have to diversify
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.120]   because who knows what could happen in any one country.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.520]   The US might ban TikTok.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.120]   If your entire life is based around
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.440]   I make money off of TikTok, guess you're screwed.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.720]   Maybe you should have diversified, all right?
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.600]   And so my investment philosophy is
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.000]   I don't trust any one country.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.640]   I trust the government of St. Lucia
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.720]   more than I trust the government of the United States.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.640]   But I want to have property that I can use
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.160]   and I can enjoy that funds me being comfortable
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.760]   and working in my business and doing well.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.160]   I want to have, you know, dividend stocks
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.000]   that allow me to eat
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.040]   so I don't have to dip into my business,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.120]   which is the ultimate growth stock.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   And then I'll have some stocks and other growth assets
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.720]   that are well diversified around the world.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.160]   'Cause I think that the story of the 21st century
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.440]   is going to be away from the West, I do.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.200]   - When you think about the business culture
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.040]   that you grew up in, I have five children
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   and my eldest is 10.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.200]   The thing that I'm most obsessed with at the moment
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   is trying to understand how do I impart a positive culture?
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.240]   And one component of that is a business culture.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.680]   Not the only component, but it's an important component.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.480]   In traveling the world,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.280]   do you think that it's easier for people who grow up
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.920]   in the affluence of the United States
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.000]   to absorb the business culture and then be more successful?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.560]   Or do you think that those, do you think otherwise?
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.820]   Do you think somehow those experiences are now universal
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.520]   and a child growing up in another context
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.680]   can be just as successful?
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.840]   - Well, personally, what I've always said
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.340]   is if I were to have children,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.520]   I think if you can afford it,
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.980]   the worst thing you can do is to send your kids
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.040]   to the public school system
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.080]   or even a private school system.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.240]   I went to private school for three years.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.680]   They were the worst three years of my schooling.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.000]   I was treated the worst in those cases
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.580]   because they're smaller private schools.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.880]   You're more of an outlier if you come in later.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.000]   I've always said, you have tutors.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.240]   And I saw an article, I forget,
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.000]   maybe the Wall Street Journal recently,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.140]   where that's a trend.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.160]   There's people, 100,000 bucks a year
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.120]   and they follow you around the world.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.480]   And it's like, yeah, I've been saying that.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.840]   And I met a pretty famous entertainer last year.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.240]   He's like, "Yeah, that's what I do."
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.840]   So if you do that, you're giving your children,
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.980]   in my opinion, speaking as someone
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.480]   who doesn't have children, the best experience
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.340]   because when you send them off to school
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.640]   and they make friends, who knows what they could be?
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.600]   I have three adopted sisters.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.080]   And there was a time in high school
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.960]   when two of the younger ones, the twins,
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.600]   they went to a new school and they got in with a crowd
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.160]   that could have had some damage to them.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.520]   How do you control that to some extent?
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.800]   You can give them all the values
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.000]   and you can give them all the morals
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.280]   and you can give them all the things to look for,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.200]   but you don't control that.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.120]   I think, in a sense, you wanna,
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.840]   I would say you want social interaction with kids
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.600]   that you understand how those kids are,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.100]   but that there's more about shared values
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.720]   than about shared geography.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.360]   I mean, if I grew up in Avon Lake, Ohio,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.520]   like that's the thing that ties us together?
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.880]   We're all from Avon Lake, Ohio.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   We must all be the same.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.020]   It's like, maybe in some ways we're more similar
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.640]   than someone in Bangladesh or something,
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.240]   but like, do we really all have that much in common?
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.520]   I think, and I was asked recently,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.840]   are you grateful for the United States?
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.160]   And I said, no, I'm grateful for certain people
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.680]   who are from there who helped me.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.200]   I also think that if you're a great entrepreneur,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.040]   and again, just listening,
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.440]   I've listened to tons of interviews at the time.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.000]   It's very cathartic.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.840]   I haven't heard a single great entrepreneur
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.760]   who didn't have some kind of personal trauma in their lives.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.040]   They may have grown up wealthy, but they were bullied,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.000]   or maybe they grew up poor and people made fun of them,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.080]   or some rich guy said, "You can't date my daughter,"
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.640]   and something that drove them.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.760]   I think the affluence part,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.920]   I don't know why people tie that to the geography.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.320]   I've said recently, if I had the choice
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.000]   to give my child one citizenship, US or Mexican,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.840]   I'd choose Mexican, okay?
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.880]   18 years from now, they'll be an adult.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.440]   Think Mexico's gonna be in a better place.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.620]   Are they gonna be wealthier on an individual basis?
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.320]   Maybe not yet, but it's moving in the right direction.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.080]   Everything's moving in a direction.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.560]   The US is moving in the wrong direction.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.200]   Mexico, for all of its problems,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.580]   I think is somewhat positive,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.040]   but I think I'll probably always be an affluent person.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.880]   To your point, I'm gonna teach them the lessons
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.120]   that I learned, which are geography agnostic.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.080]   It doesn't matter if I teach them in Avon Lake, Ohio,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.040]   or if I teach them in Mexico,
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.120]   or if I teach them in Ireland,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.760]   or here in Columbia, or anywhere else.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   Those are my lessons.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   That's part of me.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.220]   But anyway, my child is gonna have those attributes.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.660]   They're gonna get that training.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.980]   They're gonna be able to go to schools,
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.940]   or whatever it is that they need.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.180]   And I think people push back on that as,
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.700]   like, "Oh, that's stupid.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.460]   "The US is so much wealthier."
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.700]   But I'm wealthier than the average American.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.380]   So therefore, that's not gonna change.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.220]   That's why I have the dividend stocks and everything else.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.740]   I'm not putting it all on red.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.980]   I wanna make sure to some extent
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.500]   the business gets to grow as much as it can,
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.920]   but there's a thing like,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.240]   I'm not going back to working at a supermarket.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.320]   Nothing wrong with that, by the way,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.520]   but I'd like to stay at some certain level
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   so that I can give any children that.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.380]   And by the way, I'd rather have my children,
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.720]   I think I'd like to have my children
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.160]   out in the street selling something
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.360]   and learning real lessons,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.880]   like the kind of forced entrepreneurship
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.980]   you have in some of the cultures,
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.040]   like here in Columbia, or in Mexico, or anywhere else,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.000]   than kind of this coddled upbringing
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.240]   where they're playing video games.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.120]   From everything I hear, the US is very toxic these days.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.360]   And I just think if you bring things to your family,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.420]   they're always gonna have that.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.620]   And people are so wrapped up in
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.660]   being American brings them something,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.300]   I guess because they don't have anything else
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.940]   to be proud of.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.220]   If you have something else to be proud of,
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.220]   what does it matter?
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.180]   Really, what does it matter?
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.540]   I think you want to have a little bit of that friction
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.500]   where you're not just with everybody else
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.500]   who you think is kind of like you,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.340]   but really they're not.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.940]   I mean, how many people from where I'm from
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.900]   did anything like what I did?
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.780]   Nothing wrong with that,
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.600]   but how were we at all alike to grow up together?
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   - Right.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.200]   I'd like, your business, Nomad Capitalist,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.880]   is positioned as a high-end bespoke service
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.480]   that serves six and seven,
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.360]   or seven and eight figure entrepreneurs,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.960]   high end of the market.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.840]   As you mentioned, there's lots of people
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.240]   that came to you years ago who were just getting started
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.480]   and wanted simple advice.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.480]   And there's many people who try to help people
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.060]   go be digital nomads and make a few thousand dollars.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.180]   I would imagine that learning to serve the wealthy
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.540]   and the very wealthy has required you
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.760]   to learn some new skills.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.820]   You grow up in, not poor, but in a humble way
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.340]   as a scrappy entrepreneur,
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.500]   and yet you've developed this bespoke high-end business.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.340]   How have you learned to deal with the psychology
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.180]   of that growth process?
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.740]   And how have you learned to serve those clients
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.100]   in the way that they most appreciate?
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.060]   - I think my family was somewhat successful.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.580]   We were not living in mansions,
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.380]   or we didn't have connections.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.820]   Maybe my dad, from being in the radio,
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.180]   knew the congressman or something.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.420]   But we lived in a very nice neighborhood,
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.460]   but we lived in the cheapest house,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.500]   'cause that's what my parents wanted.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.340]   And they were very clear.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.420]   Like, my dad's like, "I'm not giving you my business.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.020]   "We're not giving you, like, you have to start from zero."
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.620]   So I got the lessons, and I got the security
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.180]   of like, okay, you live in a nice neighborhood,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.020]   and I get that.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.980]   And I did learn a lot.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.220]   I worked in restaurants as a kid,
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.140]   and I look back, and I say, "Yeah, you know,"
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.340]   'cause, you know, maybe I knew something
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.700]   from that upbringing about how to, like,
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.780]   take care of people.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.580]   I think what Nomad Capitalist has been built for,
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.940]   I mean, I don't care how wealthy I am,
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.140]   I would never call KPMG.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.020]   And we've worked with billionaires.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.740]   I sat in the living room with a guy.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.340]   He said, "Yeah, I hired KPMG."
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.900]   And, okay, that's interesting.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.200]   He's like, "The first thing they asked me was,
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.620]   "'Have you heard of Switzerland?'"
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.460]   He's like, "I'm a billionaire.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.620]   "Of course I've heard of Switzerland."
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.460]   He's like, "I think you bring something
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.680]   "that the other firms don't.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.760]   "It's okay, like, they have their thing.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.320]   "You can kind of tell, like, this person wrote that,
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.740]   "and this person, they kind of jammed it all together.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.580]   "It's okay."
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.740]   He calls KPMG.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.820]   I just, I don't, I'm not a guy who ever could,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.140]   'cause I still have that scrappy entrepreneur.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.060]   I think there's a lot of people like me,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.860]   even in what they call the ultra-high-net-worth segment,
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.260]   the $30 million and up.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.580]   There's about 600,000 known people
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.580]   who have $30 million liquid in the world.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.700]   And I don't think that they're all,
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.740]   I mean, it's not what you'd expect.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.600]   And I'll tell you, when you go to Eastern Europe
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.000]   in particular, I've had some friction on this,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.480]   and it's been good friction, 'cause you learn something.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.800]   I got in an argument with a guy at the burrito place once.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.640]   I like to get a burrito.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.120]   I like, I'm a frugal guy.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   I go to the burrito place.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   The guy's nasty.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.480]   I kind of snap back at him.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.640]   He's like, "Well, who are you?
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.780]   "You're broke.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.080]   "You're eating a burrito."
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.520]   It's like, have you seen Michael Bloomberg
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.240]   eating a hot dog at 57th and Fifth Avenue?
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.360]   Like, that's their mentality.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.080]   And I think it's the mentality of a lot of people right now
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.980]   is, if you go on Instagram,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.460]   oh, do you fly in private jets?
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.260]   Well, by the way, okay, I did a couple times.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.700]   Do I like talk about it?
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.300]   You know, I just didn't tell anybody about it.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.420]   Like, can you take one picture?
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.260]   I felt embarrassed.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.260]   Like, okay.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.860]   But like, I don't make it my entire ethos.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.540]   And so, I imagine there's plenty of people out there like,
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.140]   oh, how successful can he be?
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.500]   Like, here's what people do.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.860]   They eat caviar and everything.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.820]   No.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   There's a lot of people who have 30, 50, $100 million
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.160]   that's just like, I just want good service.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.320]   I want to know I'm taken care of.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.440]   You know who the best clients are?
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.000]   Are the ones who they went somewhere else
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.720]   and maybe they did the process
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.360]   or maybe they aborted the process.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.860]   And they're like, you know what?
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.000]   These guys didn't know anything.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.440]   I went to a private bank not so long ago.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.260]   They want a million dollars minimum.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.460]   They talk about, we do your tax and global tax and all this.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.720]   And I said, what do you know about U.S. Citus Assets?
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   You know, can you help me with that?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.960]   Because, you know, I'm a non-U.S. person.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.400]   I don't want to have U.S. Citus Assets
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.600]   as an estate tax implication, other things.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.080]   And he gave me the most fluffy non-answer
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.320]   I've ever heard in my life.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.480]   You come to know my capitalist.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.440]   We've got a network of people all around the world.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.160]   We actually tell you what to do.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.360]   And our guys tell you what to do.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.480]   But, you know, if we're not maybe giving you the tax advice
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.500]   in the memo, we have the professionals for that,
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.640]   but we're bringing it all together.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   So a lot of people say they provide the service,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.900]   but they don't.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.800]   And so I think that to a certain extent,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.680]   if you are new money, maybe not quick money,
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.800]   you know, if you just went from a dollar
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.160]   to a hundred million dollars yesterday,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.680]   you're probably going to not have understood the journey.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.240]   But if you've understood the journey as you have or I had,
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.120]   and you got to a certain level of success,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.960]   I think what you want most,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.160]   yeah, you want to be taken care of,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.760]   but you don't want to be screwed around.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.920]   And I can't tell you how many private banks and lawyers.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.400]   And I got a friend, I was talking to a guy,
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.800]   we call him the coach.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.920]   He says, you call these guys,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.720]   they can't even answer a question about their own country.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.760]   He's like, I'm moving to Indonesia.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.520]   I call the Indonesian immigration lawyer.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.800]   He's like, oh, you know, I need to get back to you on that.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.640]   It's like, you don't know, like just, you know what I mean?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.240]   I think people like the approach of multi-jurisdiction.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.440]   They like being taken care of.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   I love like unreasonable hospitality.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.720]   I love doing all that kind of stuff.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.840]   That's been, I think we've done a good job
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.320]   because I think that my kind of natural,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.480]   I guess what they would consider
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.640]   in some of these countries, low self-esteem,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.560]   where like, you're not constantly pumping your chest,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.760]   you admit your mistakes.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.520]   Like in a lot of countries like that,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.600]   they see you as a weak person for admitting mistakes.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.880]   No joke.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.920]   Like a woman in some of these like countries would be like,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.920]   he's not a strong man.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.600]   Like this, he's a weak man.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.200]   Like the, not the sophisticated ones,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.640]   but just, you know, kind of your everyday person.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.960]   Because they just know like people who are always,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.560]   I'm right, I'm the best.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.640]   And so I think what they've taken from that,
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.120]   that was good was,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.520]   hey, let's be really open to helping people
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.840]   because they've, in their mind, okay,
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.360]   like we don't have as many boundaries.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.720]   We don't have as much self-esteem.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.160]   We're now going back and kind of fixing that.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.800]   Like, yeah, let's have some boundaries.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.400]   And occasionally, you know, it's created a couple issues.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.440]   But I think like it worked well from that.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.480]   It kind of worked a different way than I would have expected
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.120]   that people really took care of the clients.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.000]   But now it's like, okay, let's have the boundaries.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.320]   Let's think very high of ourselves.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.160]   A lot of people love it.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.560]   Just saw a guy next door coming to this interview.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.640]   Oh, I love your stuff.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.280]   But let's do the unreasonable hospitality
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.720]   and let's just help people do whatever they have to be done.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.920]   And I think, you know,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.840]   I think when you do that, you succeed.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.360]   - It seems obvious to me that you could retire today
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.480]   and live your lifestyle for a long time,
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.600]   whether or not you sold Nomad Capitalist
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.960]   and if you sold the company,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.760]   then certainly you could retire at a fairly young age.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.280]   You have an enormous team,
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.400]   enormous pressure, enormous stress.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.480]   Why do you do it?
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   What drives you now?
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.960]   - I go back to the, what's the other option?
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.400]   I think, you know, if you're wired a certain way,
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.240]   what do you do?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.840]   I just heard, saw Dave Ramsey clip the other day.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.160]   Someone's calling, should I sell my business
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.000]   for $12 million?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.480]   He says, I don't know a single person
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.200]   over all the decades who sold their business,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.680]   who kind of didn't go back and regret it.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.800]   And they talked about the good old days.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.320]   I know people who have sold businesses
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.160]   and I think that they're happy about it.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.240]   But I think there's probably a lot of people
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.840]   like what Dave is talking about.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.520]   I would imagine, the point when I said,
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.040]   maybe I would do that, was a time of great frustration.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.200]   And there's an Arabic phrase that I'm told,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.680]   maybe someone will correct me in the comment section.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.200]   But it's like, if someone says, you know,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.640]   I wanna die, I wanna kill myself.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.600]   You don't wanna kill yourself.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.200]   'Cause if you threw yourself in the ocean,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.960]   the middle of the ocean, you try and hang on,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.920]   like you would instinctively try and grab onto something
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.360]   or figure out a way to save yourself.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.000]   You're trying to kill a part of you inside
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   that you don't want anymore.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.360]   And I think that probably, I would guess
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.720]   that some people who sell their businesses,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.080]   like there's just something that frustrates them.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.680]   It's, well, why don't you just sell that?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   And you know, that's something that I went through.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   It's like, okay, like how do you keep leveling it up?
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.160]   We can talk about, you know,
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.720]   maybe there's a sense of complacency.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.680]   I don't know, overseas, I don't know.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.200]   But first of all, I enjoy what I do.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.360]   If I weren't doing this, I'd be doing the same thing,
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.560]   trying to figure out like,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.600]   how does that Egyptian deal work?
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.240]   But now I wouldn't have the people to help me.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.280]   And like, no one would care.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120]   Like, who are you?
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.560]   Like, Henderson, I'd never heard of, like, ah.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.760]   You know, so why not, you know,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.120]   have the resources to do all this stuff?
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.920]   'Cause I am the living embodiment.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.680]   Like, and that's why I keep mentioning it, you know,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.600]   our live event.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.400]   There's people not in this exact space,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.280]   but they kind of do like the doom and gloom, get out,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.840]   maybe a little bit of it's like the second passport.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.040]   They're telling Americans how to do that
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.880]   with an event in Miami.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.680]   How authentic is that?
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.600]   Listen, if you want to learn what I'm doing,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.760]   I want to actually put you in the water for a little bit.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.920]   Our event's in Kuala Lumpur.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.760]   Come and see it.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.720]   You'll be impressed.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.040]   You're going to love the quality of healthcare.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.880]   You're going to say, wow,
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.200]   this is much better than I've expected.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.320]   I'm not going to Miami.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.680]   First of all, I got people in all countries
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.160]   all around the world who cost a lot less
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.760]   and have a lot better attitudes.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.600]   They're not going to get a visa to go to Miami
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.800]   'cause the U.S. government's, you know,
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.920]   is prejudiced against them.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.080]   But why would I go there and do that, right?
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.040]   I'm the living embodiment of this.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.960]   And so it's almost like the business kind of grew
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   out of my own personal interest.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.200]   And other people said, hey, can you help me with that?
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.240]   Oh, you're doing that?
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.840]   And I'm like the banker who just goes home at five o'clock
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.040]   or probably earlier.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.720]   I actually want to know how U.S. CITUS tax works.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.280]   So that really, that keeps me up at night.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.200]   Like I'm worried about it personally.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.920]   I didn't want to give up U.S. citizenship
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.880]   and then let them take 45% of my U.S. stocks when I croak.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   So I think it's just a calling.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.760]   And honestly, I think that that's why
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.520]   just from a relationship standpoint,
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.560]   you have to have someone
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.360]   and maybe dating all over the world opens this up for you
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.840]   who understands who you are.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.880]   'Cause I bet a lot of spouses are like,
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.720]   yeah, you have enough.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.880]   You got 50 million.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.960]   What else do you need?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.280]   I'm 39 years old, my grandmother's 95 this year.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.760]   If I live that long, that's a lot more to live.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.520]   To do what?
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.560]   I think there's a passion about it.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.000]   That's what it has.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.280]   And I think, and I often ask myself like,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.520]   okay, he's not the business owner.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.400]   What is Bob Iger come back to Disney?
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.480]   He should do a Seinfeld, go out in the high note.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.600]   He left that place like in pretty good shape.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.320]   And then maybe some of his policies you can argue
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.120]   like kind of came through like the wokes.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:08.960]   I don't know.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.760]   But like, you could have just pinned that.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.320]   What was the other guy's name?
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.160]   Lonnie Donegan.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.000]   Who came in?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.680]   Chapic, right?
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.200]   Long, so soon gone, so long forgotten.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.000]   Why did he come back?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.360]   I would guess the guys are obsessive about it.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.600]   Why does Howard Schultz come back?
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.960]   Why do these guys come back?
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.320]   They can't live without it.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.080]   And I just, I don't know how else you can describe it
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.560]   but that.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.080]   - A few rapid fire questions.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.800]   In my experience,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.600]   going international was not something
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.400]   that I could do all at once.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.240]   It was something that every stage I had to try
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.120]   and then discover how that felt.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.080]   Remember the first offshore bank account I went and opened,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.040]   I felt like a total weirdo going and doing it.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.360]   And then a few weeks later, I'm like,
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.520]   but that was totally normal.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.800]   It wasn't a big deal.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   So what are the first three steps that somebody should take
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.640]   that are simple and easy to start getting exposure
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.240]   to an international context?
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.600]   - If the goal is you're in plan B, you're not moving yet,
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.400]   I would challenge why you're only at plan B.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.120]   I don't care if you have kids, I don't care.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.720]   You can move as you've proven,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.560]   which is why I'm excited to hear your speech.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.760]   I think having the bank account,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.080]   having some kind of a residence permit,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.920]   having a place to go.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.000]   Robert Kiyosaki said it,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.560]   our very first Nomad Capitalist Live,
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   where can you be in three days?
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.920]   When it hits the fan, when the first starts flying,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.280]   residence permits there.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.560]   The next step really depends.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.000]   But I think a passport's also good.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.560]   If you have ancestry, check that out.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.160]   Those are things that you can do pretty quickly.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.920]   If you have gold, move some gold overseas.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.000]   It doesn't matter, just any of the things
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.960]   that I would talk about, do it on a small level.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.360]   Buy a property overseas.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.440]   If you wanna live somewhere that's tax-friendly perhaps,
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.480]   and you wanna go there in the summer,
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.920]   maybe look at buying a property.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.440]   Just get some connections to start to break the dogma
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.680]   that hey, things only work here.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.120]   And I would say maybe the very first thing to do
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.160]   is to be surrounded by people who are of that mind.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.400]   My father now spends six months in Mexico,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.280]   and he wants to get the other six months in the U.S.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.900]   down to a lot less.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.740]   Why?
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.560]   He saw me doing it.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.400]   That inspired him.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.140]   He wouldn't have gone to Mexico 15 years ago.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.980]   But he saw it.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.800]   Okay, people are doing it.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.640]   They're not dying.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.920]   They're enjoying their lives.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.660]   Their wealth isn't all gone.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.720]   Hey, maybe I should do some of that.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.900]   So I think maybe that's the first step,
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.040]   then some kind of bank account,
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.320]   then some kind of immigration permission.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.440]   - For an English-speaking audience,
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.360]   especially someone who hasn't traveled the world,
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.000]   what are three countries
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.080]   that from your experience with your clients,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.520]   you would suggest that somebody go for a visit?
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.760]   Places that seem to have wide appeal
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.080]   to an English-speaking audience.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.400]   - It really is so different.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.640]   I mean, Mexico has gotten widespread appeal.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.000]   I was saying eight years ago.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.680]   Move to Mexico, not Canada if your guy doesn't get elected.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.280]   There's a certain kind of person who wants to go there.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.120]   Time zones, by the way, for entrepreneurs are a big thing.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.840]   So I talk about Malaysia would be my second choice.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.040]   It is a terrible time zone
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.700]   if you're working with North America.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.820]   I think Malaysia is one that really resonates with people
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.840]   if you're open-minded.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.440]   I mean, it's not the name brand.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.760]   It's not Thailand,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.520]   but I would argue it's better from a tax,
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.760]   lifestyle, English-language perspective.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.680]   There's places in Mexico where English is spoken.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.880]   Spanish is easy enough to learn.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.520]   So those are two that jump out to me.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.040]   I mean, Georgia, I've talked about for so many years.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.760]   I think that it's not near as affordable as it once was,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.280]   but there's a lot of potential there.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.280]   So Georgia's one.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.440]   Here in Colombia is interesting.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.180]   I don't know if it's a full-time place to live.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.800]   I mean, there's something for everybody.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.620]   I'll even tell you.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.800]   I know there's people who watch Tucker Carlson
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.000]   and that's where they get all their news.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.440]   And I'm sure Tucker Carlson and I agree on plenty of things,
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.720]   but I think Ireland is an interesting place
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.760]   because it's pretty close.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.240]   I would argue there's places in the United States
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.200]   that are culturally more close to Ireland
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.020]   than to wherever you're moving to save taxes
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.820]   and escape some crazy Democrat governor.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.920]   And so that's a tax-friendly place
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.880]   where they speak English and the government's more efficient.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.560]   It does have some of the Western problems,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.880]   but not nearly as many.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.440]   It's a pretty neutral country and they're pretty efficient
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.080]   and the government smiles at you.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.040]   So, I mean, those are some that I think are on the radar,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.840]   but heck, I mean, there's people who go to Mauritius
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.680]   and they like it.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.400]   I mean, it's 252 countries and territories.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.340]   - For somebody who wants to move some money
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.800]   to another jurisdiction,
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.480]   what are three of the most useful banking jurisdictions
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.220]   that you find are really helpful
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.500]   for your clients right now?
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.620]   - Singapore's, I think, the kind of high-level transaction,
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.700]   even in our company, we were like,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.460]   okay, let's have a treasury management account
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.340]   in Switzerland.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.540]   They really put you through the ringer.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.540]   I say to myself, like, did I become successful
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.820]   to prove myself to Claude?
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.180]   It's not even Claude, by the way.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.300]   Like, they don't even have any Swiss guys working there.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.480]   You know, they're, you know, listen, give me credit.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.340]   Like, I'm pretty transparent.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.500]   Like, I hire people all over the world
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.100]   and we pay some of them pretty well,
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.700]   but I mean, like, you know, I'm not sitting here like,
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.300]   no, we're fancy, we're Swiss, we're in the Rococo,
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.820]   building from the Rococo period,
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.740]   you didn't pay us very high fees.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.380]   I'm like, listen, I hire, if someone from Georgia,
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.400]   it's 24, they did the best job, I'm hiring that person.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.800]   That's what they do, but they pretend they don't do it.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.220]   So, for all those reasons, I'm not a big fan.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.340]   They don't, you don't even know how much money
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.900]   you need to open a Swiss account.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.340]   Like, you just go in and they kind of like look around,
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.580]   like, you're a 5 million kind of guy to me.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.980]   It's like, okay.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.580]   No, I think Singapore is vastly superior to Switzerland
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.140]   or really most of the European.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.700]   I went to Monaco and I was like,
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.420]   if I wanted to get residency, you get a bank account first.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.420]   And they're like, I had a weird tax residence.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.540]   They're like, we kind of don't like that.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.780]   And I said to myself, like,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.540]   why are there so many hoops to jump through here?
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.220]   Like, well, that's just how it is.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.420]   I said, well, that might've worked in 1962,
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.700]   but not when a growing number of those 252 places
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.500]   in the world are trying to bring in business.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.140]   So, I think Singapore is the high level one.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.860]   The problem is Americans can't really invest there.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.180]   You can just put your cash there.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.340]   There's a couple of Swiss banks that target Americans
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.540]   that are more laid back.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.160]   You know, the Caymans, I guess, is okay,
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.540]   but you have to have a connection there.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.260]   It depends how much money you want to put.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.620]   I mean, Portugal, I guess, in the EU
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.100]   for five-figure sums works,
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.900]   Georgia for any kind of sum works.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.260]   They're shrinking by the year.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.220]   They really are.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.500]   I'm a fan of having residences and citizenships
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.780]   and properties that facilitate that.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.460]   So, you know, you can get a bank account in the UAE,
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.900]   by the way, probably the most dreadful banking service
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.980]   I've gotten on planet Earth or planet Zutron.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.180]   You can't, it's very hard to function.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.180]   Honestly, try to run a company there without being there.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.060]   Forget it, can't do it.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.260]   So, anyway, but if you get a residence permit there,
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.020]   it makes the bank account opening process easier.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.820]   I'm not saying the banks aren't strong.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.900]   Put your money there, forget about it.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.740]   Break glass in case-
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.020]   - Not even you can use it.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.340]   - Break glass in case, you got to fly there,
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.220]   you got to talk to some guy for four hours
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.060]   and shout at him and then,
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.780]   "All right, fine, we'll give you your money."
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.940]   But if you get other residence permits in Singapore,
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.380]   I think banks in Malaysia are pretty strong.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.860]   You know, if you have a residence permit,
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.700]   you can bank there.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.440]   So, I mean, I think the number one is Singapore.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.860]   If you're just starting out with like little,
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.180]   you know, small amounts, George is a good one.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.900]   There's some, there's plenty in between,
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.460]   but I think that where you have a connection
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.660]   can really drive where you want to bank
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.900]   because a lot of places that are stable don't allow that.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.180]   Singapore, it's big three banks,
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.460]   12, 13, and 14 safest banks in the world yet again.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.460]   Probably the most accessible on that list.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.720]   - You didn't mention the Channel Islands, the UK.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.340]   Do they still have value, do you think?
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.420]   - It's tough, that's tough.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.620]   It's, they're going to be,
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.180]   if you go to Singapore and say, "Hey, listen,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.100]   I just gave up my U.S. citizenship.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.980]   I'm a citizen of, you know, whatever.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.240]   I'm St. Kitts and Nevis, for example.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.140]   And, you know, I have a tax residence in,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.500]   you know, wherever.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.420]   Georgia or Antigua, right?
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.620]   Get into places that are more flexible.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.780]   They don't really judge you on that.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.980]   Like, that's what I love about Singapore.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.900]   I went in, but I've got an African passport.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.200]   I got kind of like on a lark.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.700]   Someone kind of sponsored me.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.380]   And Singapore, it's a visa-free country.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.900]   I go in, and it's just, it's like so Singaporean,
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.700]   so German, the guy's like, "I don't see, you know what?
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.340]   30 days, okay, 30 days."
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.300]   It's not like, "What is this country?
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.780]   Like, I don't understand."
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.220]   You know, they're not judgmental.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.980]   And so I think that in the Channel Islands,
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.500]   I mean, we looked at kind of putting part
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.940]   of the corporate structure in the Isle of Man.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.660]   I think the Isle of Man offers a lot of benefits.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.700]   But again, the answer to the question
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.660]   of why it's so much more bureaucratic,
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.820]   that's just how it is.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.180]   Get that's just how it is out of your mindset.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.420]   Like, why?
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.260]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.700]   It isn't anymore.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.140]   That's how it is there.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.460]   And if you live in the Isle of Man your entire life
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.740]   or Jersey your entire life, you're like, "Oh, okay, great."
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.500]   For me personally, by the way,
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.960]   there were one or two companies
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.760]   in one of the industries that we work in
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.780]   where Jersey kind of went to them and was like,
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.940]   "Yeah, we don't want any problems with the EU
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.220]   with selling passport.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.380]   Why don't you move out?
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.420]   Get out!"
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.220]   So it's like, for me, for that reason,
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.180]   I wouldn't be as appealing.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.140]   So, I mean, I think you want places where they're like,
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.900]   "We don't care who you are or where you're from,
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.100]   as long as you love us, come on in."
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.000]   Whereas I think there's a lot of kind of judgment
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.300]   and a lot of other places.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.300]   - Two more questions.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.580]   I saw your interview with Jim Rogers
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.300]   where you spoke quite a lot about Uzbekistan.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.140]   - He likes that.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.180]   - For, in your opinion, for a young aggressive man
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.780]   who wants to go to a frontier market
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.500]   where there's room, et cetera,
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.500]   what are two or three places that you think have good bones
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.620]   and good growth opportunities?
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.260]   - I mean, if you look at,
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.980]   you're the driver of your success.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.740]   I imagine, listen, you can go to the U.S.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.180]   People are still starting billion dollar businesses
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.260]   in the U.S.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.500]   I think the kind of person who looks at an emerging market,
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.380]   if you're young, is maybe I'm not gonna build the next,
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.460]   you know, meta or open AI or whatever,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.380]   but I just wanna build a nice business, make some money,
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.780]   and maybe grow it out.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.980]   You're gonna have an easier time building businesses
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.580]   that maybe don't exist yet.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.580]   Africa, we've had people who go there.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.500]   I mean, it's like playing on cheat mode
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.100]   in one of those countries.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.340]   In simple businesses, I sell cement.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.100]   You know, I make 100% returns every month or something.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.620]   Like, you know, I like Southeast Asia.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.460]   I think there's a good consumer culture there.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.420]   I think you can build teams more easily there.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.940]   So Cambodia's been a place I've liked.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.780]   I've got a friend who's working there
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.460]   and building a property fund.
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.020]   I think we look at Bangladesh and, well, Bangladesh
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.620]   and maybe Nepal as kind of the two of the next ones.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.180]   Uzbekistan is opening up, which makes it interesting.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.020]   I mean, look at Georgia.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.060]   You could have done real estate.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.380]   You could have done a lot of things in Georgia
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.260]   five, 10, 20 years ago and had a proportion of return.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.700]   I think here in Latin America, it could be good.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.540]   More bureaucracy, I think, in Latin America.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.620]   But what you have to go in understanding is the culture.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.900]   You have to be ready for that.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.700]   I think we all have this idea.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.500]   This is where I've kind of lacked
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.380]   some of the support over the years
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.140]   is when I'll call one of my friends in Canada
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.380]   who did someone's business for $100 million
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.220]   and I'll tell him an issue I had
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.100]   with someone who works for me.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.620]   He'll be like, "Oh, you're probably just seeing it wrong."
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.180]   It's like, no, it's a cultural difference.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.660]   Like, you know, that culture functions differently.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.380]   And maybe some cultures aren't as nice as other cultures.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.300]   Like, you have to go in kind of understanding that
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.540]   and be prepared for that and being able to adapt.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.220]   I mean, as we said, if you...
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.500]   I remember one of our countries, the people said,
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.860]   I would go in, I was there for three months
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:36.860]   and I would go into the office every day
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.700]   and say, "Good morning."
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.060]   They would never say, "Good morning," ever.
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.020]   After a while, I started to get
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.500]   like really kind of angry/depressed.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.900]   And I'm like, "What the hell is wrong with you people?"
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.140]   And someone kind of pulled me aside.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.180]   They're like, "Listen, here in our country,
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.340]   "the CEO is a nasty a-hole.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   "He thinks that you're a worthless piece of crap.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.180]   "He doesn't want to talk to you.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.540]   "He doesn't want to know your name.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.780]   "He doesn't even want to know you exist.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.620]   "That's what we're used to."
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.220]   And I'm like, "But that's not how I..."
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.260]   Yeah, we get that, but we also don't get it.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.340]   And so you have to be prepared to kind of...
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.860]   Now, listen, that's not every country.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.180]   You go to Malaysia, you go to Cambodia,
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.420]   this guy, the people are too nice to him.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.260]   That's the problem.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.860]   It's like, "Give me some strength."
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.140]   Or like in some of these Asian countries,
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.980]   like, "We're waiting for our instructions."
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.900]   Like, you know, nuance, like, you know, get it.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.140]   So, but you've got to understand what you're going into.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.380]   I think it's gonna build incredible character.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.860]   It's gonna help you understand yourself
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.780]   in a much better way.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.580]   It's gonna build self-awareness incredibly faster
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.060]   than staying around people who are very similar to you.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.540]   And I'm not trying to like unsell it.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.380]   I'm just saying like,
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.940]   don't think it's gonna be like the U.S.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.860]   Now, you go back to the U.S.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.740]   Every once in a while, I think,
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.340]   "Oh, maybe hiring in the U.S., maybe that's the answer."
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.260]   And then you go and everybody's fat and happy
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.940]   and everybody's like, "When is my siesta?"
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.700]   And like, you know, okay.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:53.860]   But I think that Southeast Asia, Central Asia,
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   you know, Georgia's pretty easy to navigate.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.820]   Latin America is very bureaucratic,
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.180]   but I think that like immigrants
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.220]   are very well accepted in Latin America.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.900]   Yeah, those are all places you can do stuff.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.060]   I personally like the asset-light business
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.620]   where you just go overseas
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.980]   and you can run it from anywhere and you can pivot.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.660]   And I can say, "Hey, this year I've got more Americans,
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.460]   "next year it's more Brazilians."
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.700]   But if you want to do something on the ground,
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.860]   there's still incredible opportunities,
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.460]   Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Central Asia.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.060]   - You've made a public statement in the past.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.020]   You said, "If I had to do it all over again,
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.940]   "knowing what I know now,
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.060]   "I could do in a year what took me five years
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.060]   "or 10 years to figure out on my own."
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:33.900]   - Most of it.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.180]   - Obviously you built the knowledge,
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:42.700]   but what is it that you could do in a year now
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.300]   with the knowledge and experience you have
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.860]   from an international perspective
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.820]   that you couldn't do when you were just starting out?
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.060]   - Well, part of it's just the comfort level, right?
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.780]   Remember when I got my St. Lucia passport,
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.700]   I was dating a girl at the time and I was discussing like,
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.780]   "It's $100,000, a little bit of fees, okay.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.780]   "I'm the nomadic capitalist.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.220]   "Someone's gonna kind of help me out with the fees,
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.300]   "but I'm paying the 100 grand."
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.340]   And I'm like, "Should I do it?"
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.340]   No, in my case, she's like, "Listen,
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.180]   "it's good for your brand.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.940]   "It's good for your mastery."
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.700]   But she's like, "You're probably not gonna look back
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.060]   "and regret it 'cause you're gonna be more successful."
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.140]   And I think that the same thing
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.060]   that drives you to become successful perhaps,
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.140]   where you maybe don't entirely believe in yourself,
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.940]   you're trying to prove somebody wrong,
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.140]   makes you think like, "Hey,
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.860]   "I've fought for most of my life.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.460]   "Maybe that's the last 100 grand I'll ever make.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.180]   "Maybe my talents will evaporate tomorrow.
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.020]   "And maybe you think like,
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.060]   "maybe I'm not even that talented."
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.820]   So I think if you get over that,
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.140]   that's what you're getting over.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.500]   I see it now, Bitcoin is doing very well.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.220]   And I say to myself, if you wanna be safe,
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.420]   if Bitcoin goes to the roof and it becomes a big news story,
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.380]   I think politicians aren't gonna attack that.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.500]   They're not gonna, "Oh, let's make sure
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.180]   "we go after that for the taxes."
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.300]   Or, "Bitcoin people can't do this."
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.860]   They're gonna start regulating it and taxing it more.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.180]   And they have billions of dollars.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.740]   I'm sorry, they're gonna outsmart you.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.300]   You're not smarter than the IRS.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.980]   They're gonna eventually, it might take them five years.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.940]   Eventually they're gonna figure it out.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:05.060]   But some of the people like, "Well,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.420]   "I bought it for 10 grand, now it's 70 grand.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.420]   "But what's with 270 grand?"
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.700]   Take 2% off the table and just be done.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.220]   And just, okay, that 2% is gone.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.180]   But it's gonna protect the other 90%
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.460]   when it triples or 10Xs or whatever it's gonna do.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.300]   And I don't know that I entirely understood that going forward
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.700]   which is why I'm kind of passionate about talking about it.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.020]   So that's a big part of it.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.900]   Understanding the cultural piece.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.540]   Maybe not going to certain places that weren't a fit.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.900]   You know, just getting everything in order.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.580]   And I think knowing, and I'll tell you something.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.700]   I remember the first time we had a bank
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.140]   where they didn't entirely understand our business.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.700]   And we just opened it and they're like,
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.900]   "What's this payment for?"
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.420]   I'm like, "Oh, give the guy company, whatever else."
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.260]   And they're like, "Well, we have people
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.500]   "who sell offshore companies."
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.740]   It's like, "No, our service is different.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.260]   "It's a different kind of service."
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.940]   And they're like, "Okay."
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.620]   And I kind of got frustrated.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.740]   I used to get frustrated with people more.
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.180]   And, you know, they didn't like that.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.700]   And they're like, "All right, well, you know,
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.540]   "you're gonna make your life difficult."
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.740]   And so, you know, now I've got a finance team
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.020]   and they just like, they think like that.
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.660]   They kind of empathize with the banks almost.
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.740]   I'm like, "No, see it from my perspective.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.300]   "Like, we understand the banks have a lot of questions."
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.140]   And so they handle that.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:17.980]   It's like, I would have put some
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.420]   of that infrastructure in place.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.900]   I took way too much on on my business
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.540]   which prevented me from doing some of this stuff.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   Like we didn't have good HR until not that many years ago.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.740]   We didn't have a finance team.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.700]   It wasn't that long ago I was making the payroll.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.540]   Like it wasn't yesterday, it wasn't last year,
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.500]   but like sooner than I wish it would have been.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:41.060]   And, you know, I think that that's kind of stuff
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.180]   all gets in the way.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:47.180]   You know, you should understand that like HSBC in Hong Kong,
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.740]   they have plenty of money in Hong Kong.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.460]   They don't really want foreign customers
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.540]   who have Hong Kong companies.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.940]   They're gonna de-risk.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.820]   Like all that kind of stuff I would have known.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.260]   I would have just, you know, avoided.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.860]   So what I did many years ago is I just kind of over-corrected
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.340]   by saying we're gonna have 12 bank accounts.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.060]   And now we've been going through kind of in the last year,
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.380]   I just closed like six personal bank accounts recently.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.060]   Like why do I need three accounts in Armenia?
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.620]   You know, but I've been closing a bunch of accounts
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.460]   in the business too.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.020]   'Cause you build the relationships
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.180]   and that can only happen over time.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.540]   But obviously if I was working with myself
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.020]   and I already had the guy here and the guy there
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.220]   who was the good banker or the good whatever,
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.500]   you would get the stuff done.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.020]   So there's just so many mistakes.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.340]   Even I remember it was in Nicaragua
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.060]   that I tried to get residence like 11 or 12 years ago.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.780]   And I made the mistake in some,
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.660]   like I gave the guy the payment in full
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.900]   'cause it was so low.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.860]   And someone's like, you should never do that in Nicaragua.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.020]   The guy's like, he has no more incentive now.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.380]   You know, so I never got that done.
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.420]   I just kind of gave up.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.660]   You know, it's all those little things.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.180]   At times a thousand, you know.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.700]   - You have an enormous wealth of content
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.780]   at nomadcapitalist.com.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.260]   You have over 2,600 videos on YouTube.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.820]   I don't know if your podcast is still out there.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.100]   It's probably a little dated at this time, but.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.780]   - They put the, I think they put the YouTube up
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.700]   as like the Nomad Capitalist audio experience.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:04.860]   - There you go.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.660]   You have thousands of articles
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.380]   and Nomad Capitalist Live in September.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.860]   I'll be there speaking in Malaysia.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.100]   Really looking forward to that.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.940]   Two years ago in Mexico, I spoke there
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.820]   and it was a great experience.
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.660]   - Yeah.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.300]   - Is there anything that you just wish people
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.660]   would ask you about as we close?
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.660]   Anything that you would love to talk about
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.580]   that doesn't fit your brand
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.820]   and your media team says, no, don't talk about that Andrew.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.660]   - Listen, I think unfortunately I'm still like
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.620]   the media team, but we have some great people.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.620]   Listen, the five magic words are go where you're treated best
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.460]   and I think you have to take an entrepreneurial approach.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.620]   You've got to take action.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.940]   You know, how do you move overseas?
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.740]   Like how do you make money overseas?
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.340]   You just do it.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.460]   And that's why Nomad Capitalist Live, Kuala Lumpur.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.300]   I live there.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.180]   It's the longest base that I've ever had.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.020]   One of the first places I went in my tour around,
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.740]   I went to every country in Southeast Asia.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.420]   Not to backpack, but like I interviewed, you know,
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.260]   the president of Standard Chartered Bank Vietnam
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.060]   to like, you know, what's going on in these countries.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.980]   I just connected with Malaysia.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:08.340]   And I, and listen, to your question of where's people go,
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.740]   you have to go and feel it.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.140]   You know, I'm here in Columbia.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.460]   I'm walking around with one of my guys the other day.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.780]   He's like, you can just feel it.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.820]   Yeah, this feel.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:16.700]   I go to Panama City.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.900]   I don't feel it.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.580]   I'm like, I don't get it.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.340]   If you feel Panama City, you should go to Panama City.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.260]   But I want to show people Kuala Lumpur.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.660]   Prince Court Hospital, one of the best hospitals.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.500]   I took the entire staff who was there in time.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.740]   I think we paid like a couple grand
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.700]   for like 12 people to get screened.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.780]   Soup to nuts.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.260]   Amazing, amazing service.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.020]   Amazingly affordable real estate there.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.980]   We do it because you have a five-star hotel.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.300]   It's like 130 bucks a night, you know, tip to toe,
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.260]   everything included.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.100]   And I just think like people should look
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.540]   at places that are off-brand.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:57.900]   Malaysia has not spent as much time,
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.500]   at least in the Western world,
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.340]   building that brand that Thailand has, for example,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.620]   or that Singapore has for different reasons.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:10.980]   I'm a big believer in being a little bit of a contrarian,
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.300]   but I think that, you know, once something gets saturated,
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.780]   to me, it just kind of goes the wrong direction.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:20.420]   So anyway, I think that's something people should consider.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.700]   And that's why we decided to do it
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.580]   for the second time, our live event there.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:24.420]   I'll tell you the other thing I'm really,
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.420]   again, it's really been a thing in my life in the last year.
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.180]   I clung a little bit to like,
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.180]   okay, let's have American clients.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.460]   'Cause I like talking to them.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.060]   I don't do all the client work anymore,
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.780]   but like, you know, they're fun to talk to.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.100]   It's harder to talk to somebody from certain countries.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.420]   But we found some great people from all around the world.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.820]   And the same thing for the event.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.700]   I think only like 40% of last year's audience
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.500]   was North American, which is still a pretty big number,
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.540]   considering it's so far away.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.900]   But like, it was great to have people
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.140]   from like so many other countries and you learn something.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.460]   And I think that even for me,
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.620]   sometimes it's just easy to kind of like cling on to like,
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:59.660]   okay, I'm overseas, but like,
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.860]   let me keep all the Americans.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.820]   And I think there's gonna be a lot of changes.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.540]   I mean, look at this TikTok thing.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.540]   I think that's a slippery slope.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.380]   I think you wanna be diversified outside of your country.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.780]   And I think you wanna go to the places
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.380]   that aren't as well known.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.980]   And if you're saying, oh, I'm an American,
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.140]   I went to the UK on vacation and they're no better.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.300]   Yeah, they're kind of the same in some ways.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.100]   You wanna go somewhere that's different.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.860]   That's why I talk with the places that I talk about.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.140]   It's not because, you know,
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.900]   it's not because I'm scraping by on two grand a month.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.500]   It's 'cause I enjoy being in Columbia, not full time.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.180]   Like I genuinely enjoy it.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.540]   And I generally watch all the construction
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.380]   that we've been hearing.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.540]   Like they're building stuff.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.140]   Like are they building anything in San Francisco?
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.980]   No.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.860]   So I don't know.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.820]   I mean, all that to say,
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.500]   obviously I wanna, you know, promote the events.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.340]   Now you're gonna be there
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.420]   and I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.020]   Look at the CEO of AirAsia.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.820]   What a success story that's been.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.220]   A million dollars he took that over for.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.020]   It's like the biggest airline in Asia.
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.780]   You wanna hear, like who's heard of Tony Fernandez
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.820]   in the Western world?
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:02.660]   - No.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.740]   - A million to billions to your point.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.020]   Now listen, no one gets rich doing the same thing twice.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:10.020]   You're not gonna start a search engine
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.140]   and become a multi-billionaire.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.820]   Like that ship has sailed.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:16.580]   But learn the lessons from a Tony Fernandez, for example.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.220]   And I'll give you one more point.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:22.220]   I'm trying to go more capitalist,
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.580]   a little bit less nomad.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.060]   I'm a little bit more sedentary.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.980]   I think the nomad people associate also
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.980]   with some of the doom and gloom stuff.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.740]   Capitalist, guy built an airline
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.860]   from a million dollars to billions of dollars.
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:33.700]   I wanna hear from that.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.260]   I don't, you know, God bless Jordan Peterson.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.300]   We know what Jordan Peterson's gonna say.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.540]   Why don't we learn how we can actually do something?
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.020]   'Cause I think optimizing for happiness
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.700]   is kind of the core of the second half of my life.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.620]   That's a key thing for me.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.700]   And I think that all that together helps you get there.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.220]   So there's a lot of different kind of points there,
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:59.500]   but I think people need to get in the comfort zone.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.860]   It's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:05.660]   And I hope that our live event will do that.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.500]   - Andrew, thank you very much.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.340]   - Pleasure.
