[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   And today we have a coaching call, a very timely, focused, poignant, date important
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.280]   topic.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.800]   See today is Thursday, December 1st, 2016.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:11.160]   And today I want you to make a plan for the next year of your life.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.920]   The next two weeks of December are some of the most valuable planning time, some of the
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.280]   most valuable planning weeks in your annual calendar.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.960]   And it took me a few years before I learned this.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.080]   I always used to get excited about end of the year planning, doing an end of the year
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.720]   review and reviewing my past calendar year and thinking about, okay, what are my dreams
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.200]   for the next calendar year?
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.480]   I would often get excited about that.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.400]   And then I would start to think about it towards the end of December.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.280]   And then I had first week of January, I would sit down and I'd be making my plans, but then
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.320]   I lost my momentum.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.080]   And roundabout, you know, usually January 1 comes and if it's a weekday, it's the following
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.960]   Monday that you wind up back at work, that you wind up back in front of your desk ready
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   to get to it.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   This year, January 1, it looks like it's coming on a Sunday.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.360]   So Monday is January 2.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.280]   So it'll happen quicker this year, but often it doesn't happen in that same way.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.960]   And in years past, that's always resulted in my feeling like I'm running, but I'm running
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.680]   behind because I wasn't ready to go on January 1.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   And I learned that in order for me to be ready to go on January 1, I need to start my planning
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.600]   on December 1.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.960]   December is a very important month for you in terms of your finances because it's still
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.440]   part of the calendar year, of the current calendar year.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.640]   There are many year-end things that you can do.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.600]   You should pay special attention to your year-end investment planning, your year-end tax planning.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.020]   The tax year for most of you is on a calendar tax year, and so December is the time where
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.920]   you still have time to make any purchases you need to make or make any investment changes.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.040]   If you'd like some ideas on end-of-the-year tax planning, go back and listen to episode
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.920]   121 of Radical Personal Finance titled "Last-Minute Tax Planning Ideas to Save You Money."
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.880]   That show was very focused on the tactics, some specific tax ideas.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.520]   Today I'm just talking about personal finance, which by the way, for those of you who are
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   new to the show, I use these two terms to mean different things.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.400]   Personal finance, I use that term usually to refer to the fundamentals of personal financial
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.640]   management as in talking about how you earn money, how you spend money, budgeting, couponing,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.240]   bargain shopping, details on just those basics of personal money management, keeping a checkbook,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   et cetera.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.200]   I use financial planning to refer to the more technical topics such as insurance choices
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.640]   or asset allocation, et cetera.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.760]   I don't know if that's right, wrong.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.080]   I don't know if anyone else does that.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.320]   That's just what I do.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.040]   So you'll often hear me use a distinction between financial planning and personal finance,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.120]   and that's what I mean.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.840]   So for financial planning topics, go back and listen to episode 121.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.880]   But recognize this, your end of the year tax planning strategy is not going to make or
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:23.280]   break your finances, but your personal financial planning strategy may.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.400]   Your end of the year assessment of the previous calendar year might make a huge difference
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   for you.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.040]   The end of the year planning process needs to start – we'll get to the process in
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   just a second.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.400]   Here's why these two weeks are so important.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.280]   It's because there's time between now – you're kind of in that end of the year
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.720]   wrap-up season – but before we wind up in Christmas.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.840]   You've got to get this done in the next two weeks before you go into the actual Christmas
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.560]   holiday or if you're traveling, et cetera, or any kind of last-minute Christmas rush.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.840]   Many of you might buy Christmas presents to give to people and so there is a little bit
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.840]   of a shopping rush.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.960]   A few years ago, my wife and I decided that the phrase of, "Oh, I'm so busy.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   It's such a busy time of year.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   We're so busy.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.160]   We're so busy," is more pontificating to sound important than it is actual reality.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.800]   We're not that busy in December.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.120]   It's not like we're that socialites that we have a Christmas – oh, we have so many
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.400]   Christmas parties to go to and I would guess that you're probably the same.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.000]   Now if you're an exception, fine.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.320]   But remember, you choose how many parties you accept invitations to.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.440]   You choose how busy you are.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.720]   Don't buy into that nonsense.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   You're not that busy in December.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   You choose to become busy because you either allow yourself to be or you just allow yourself
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.640]   to have the feelings of being busy because it's a bustling, fun time of year.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.120]   So focus on the next two weeks and here's my coaching tip and we'll get to how in
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   just a moment.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   The coaching tip is this.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.160]   Schedule some time today and that's going to be the action step.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.520]   Schedule some time today in your calendar for you to sit down with a notebook and reflect
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.000]   back on the past year, what's gone well, what hasn't gone well, what's gone well
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.560]   for you personally, professionally, financially.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:18.040]   It's time for you to think back and to consider what you'd like to be different.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.760]   If you're up for it, you can do more categories.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.480]   I just finished – right before hitting record here, I just finished taking Michael Hyatt's
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.400]   life score assessment.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.600]   Michael Hyatt is a popular – he calls himself a mentor, business mentor, online guy.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   He does this course that he does called The Best Year Ever.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.800]   My brother has done it.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.960]   I've never done it personally but my brother has done it and had a great experience with
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   it.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.560]   But he goes – went through his – as part of his best year ever running up to his launch
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   for the course, he has published this life score assessment.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.640]   It's pretty cool because he goes through his – the domains and he goes through your
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.160]   intellectual assessment for your intellectual life, your marital situation, how happy you
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.440]   are with your job and your chosen vocation, your emotional life, how you feel you're
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.480]   doing as a parent with your parental role, your hobbies, your avocations, how you are
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.520]   with your spiritual life, your physical well-being, your social life and your financial life.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.640]   I thought just his list of 10 areas of assessment was really, really valuable and I wrote down
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.400]   and took screenshots of – as I was going through the assessment of his actual questions
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.040]   so that I could reflect on them more myself.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.000]   If you want to check out what he's doing, I'll post my link.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.440]   It's an affiliate link for you to participate and read.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.180]   The assessment is free.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.560]   But I'll post that link for you in the blog post for today's show.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   And check it out.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.080]   It's worth – just for the price of admission for the questions, it's free questions.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.400]   It's awesome, really, really good.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.480]   But sit down and think about what's gone well and what hasn't gone well and do that
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.080]   yourself first.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.760]   Then if you're married, schedule some time today, schedule some time over the next couple
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:13.640]   of weeks for you to get together at a minimum for a few hours over dinner, over coffee,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   for a minimum few hours with your husband or wife.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.440]   Ideally, perhaps an overnight or even a weekend away, meaning two nights away and one entire
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   day.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.800]   It's what my wife and I are trying to do.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.240]   My daughter is having some – I don't want – concerned about inducing separation
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240]   anxiety.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.920]   We're planning to take her away here in the first week or two of December.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.880]   But at the moment, I think we might just do the shortened version of that this year.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.040]   But this is the perfect time to do it and schedule those couple of nights and sit down
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.200]   with your husband and wife.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.760]   Have them go through and do some journaling exercises.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.520]   Have them go through and think through some of the things that have gone well and things
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.680]   that haven't gone well and what you'd like to do different.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.080]   What do you want 2017 to look like in a perfect world?
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.600]   What do you want it to look like in each of those areas?
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.520]   Go take Michael Hyatt's life score assessment.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.560]   There are tons of great resources out there.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.720]   Pick something and start reflecting.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.640]   Start considering it.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:24.880]   Start considering what – consider the scope of your life.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.840]   With regard to how to do it, don't be scared to face the honest facts.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.000]   I'm working on a course and my goal is to get it launched here in a couple of weeks
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.960]   so that it can be for 2017.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.440]   We'll see if I can make it happen.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.800]   I just have been setting up the software and I'm working on the outline and I'm diligently
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.560]   working to try to set up a course for – I haven't decided if I'm going to pursue
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.760]   it monthly or weekly but basically it's going to be Joshua's 52-week financial boot
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.800]   camper or I don't know, some better title than that.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.040]   But the weekly – the things that you can do every single week and I'm going to put
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.400]   it together as a paid course and sell it to you all.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   And so I've been working hard on that outline.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   And one of the – so step one at the moment is the first lesson is simply to write down
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.880]   where you are.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.120]   So I've been thinking about that as I was working on the outline of what I want to teach
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.960]   where you begin by recognizing here's where I am.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.480]   And with finances, that means you make a list of all of your assets and all of your liabilities.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   You write down the amount of money that you have in the bank.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.760]   You write down the value of your cars, the value of your house.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.840]   You write down how much credit card debt you have.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.120]   That's where you start is by taking an honest assessment of where you are.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.960]   Now my experience as a financial planner having done even extensive work with people who are
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.120]   in financial crises is that they just don't simply want to face the facts.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.240]   I can relate to that with regard to weight.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.400]   Someone who's been overweight for practically all of my life, you often don't want to
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:03.320]   go stand on the scale and see the numbers that are there.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.480]   You got to start with actually understanding and facing the facts.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.200]   You got to face the facts no matter whether you're happy with them or whether you're
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   not happy with them.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.720]   If you're happy with them, great.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.420]   You need to know what's working.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.040]   What can you keep doing?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.060]   If you're not happy with them, great.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.640]   You need to know what's not working and what you don't want to keep doing so that
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   you can figure out how to get out.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.440]   To begin with an honest assessment of your year.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.880]   For me as I'm doing this, I have to confess I cheated.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.120]   I started before December 1.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.640]   But it was because I was so frustrated with my entire year.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.560]   So I probably started back around November 1.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:59.280]   For me there's been a big change even in regard to my own process.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.480]   As I went through this process, episode 379 where I talked about, it was the one titled
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.400]   The Perils of Success and Why I'm Taking the Filter Off of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:18.240]   That show came out of just a deep frustration with so many unrealized goals, with so many
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.040]   just deep frustrations.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.720]   I started with an assessment.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.840]   Why am I frustrated?
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.240]   Why is this not working?
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.560]   What is wrong?
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.720]   And so since then it's been fantastic.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.840]   I just have given myself the permission to face things forthrightly.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:46.600]   So I say that simply to convey to you that even when things aren't working, you've
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.480]   got to start by recognizing things aren't working.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.720]   And it's not going to get better by ignoring the situation.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.640]   Things aren't going to improve by not paying attention.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.040]   Starting point is to recognize where things are.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.160]   So I simply challenge you with that today.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.440]   Today is Thursday, December 1, 2016.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.200]   I want you to get a simple notebook.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.480]   You don't need to go buy anything.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:23.720]   Just find some simple notebook and spend some time thinking about what's gone well.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.240]   Let's just do it this way.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:32.200]   Write down what's gone well for you personally in 2016, professionally in 2016, and financially
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   in 2016.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.040]   If this is the first time you've done it, yeah, maybe you can go and take a 10-part
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.760]   thing, but maybe you should just start with those three.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.880]   Write down what's gone well.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.580]   Write down what hasn't gone well.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.360]   And then to use Dan Sullivan's magic question, although he would put the three-year time
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.940]   frame on it, I'm just going to change it to one year.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.640]   Write down this.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:14:01.200]   If we were sitting down, you and me, having a cup of coffee on December 1, 2017, because
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.760]   remember you're going to be the pro at this and you're going to be reflecting back before
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   the calendar year.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.200]   It's the whole point of the show.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.960]   So we're sitting here December 1, 2017, looking back over the last 12 months, what has to
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:23.920]   have happened for you personally, professionally, and financially for you to really feel satisfied
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.080]   with your progress?
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:35.680]   What are you working towards?
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.120]   I challenge you with that homework.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.160]   It's December 1, 2016.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.920]   It's a brand new day.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.520]   If you are not feeling great about the last year of your life, remember this.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:57.640]   It's my old buddy Zig Ziglar who for years kept me motivated and upbeat used to say,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   failure is an event.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.200]   It's not a person.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.080]   Me, Joshua Sheets, I have failed on most of my goals for this past year.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.120]   I have utterly, absolutely failed.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.840]   But I'm not a failure.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:21.560]   I, Joshua Sheets, I'm not a failure and you are not a failure either.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560]   Failure is an event.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.840]   It's not a person.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.480]   This year is about to end, but yesterday ended last night.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.960]   Today is a brand new day and it's yours.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   There's your Zig quote.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.000]   I used to love listening to him say that.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.920]   Be driving to work and facing, battling the monsters of that day.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.920]   Failure is an event.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.360]   It's not a person.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.040]   Yesterday really did end last night.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.400]   Today is a brand new day and it's yours.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.960]   You can start afresh.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.200]   2016 is going away.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.920]   2017 is coming in.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:10.600]   Take stock of the past year and make plans for the next year.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.240]   So if you failed, join the club.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:22.520]   Every person who's successful at anything has a long string of failures behind them.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:29.600]   Failures are the stories that help you sell your story of success down the road.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.760]   Nobody likes to hear somebody who's, that's what I tell myself anyway, it's true, you
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.800]   have to judge, but nobody likes to hear someone who comes in and says, "Hey, it was all easy
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   for me.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   This was great.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.240]   I just always, life's just always been, I've been a winner since the day I was born."
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.360]   No, it doesn't work that way.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.800]   There's always a failure and then there's a moment of transformation.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   So guess what?
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.200]   If you failed this last year, you're just building stories that you'll need in the future.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.360]   And many of you didn't fail this last year.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.400]   Many of you crushed it and that's awesome.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.600]   You still need to reflect and you still need to consider back and you most importantly
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.760]   need to think about what was it that worked well because there is a tremendous danger
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.680]   in success.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:23.720]   One of the major dangers is that you'll stop doing the things that made you successful
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.040]   in the first place.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.640]   Consider a marriage, husband and wife.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.120]   They're courting one another, they're not married yet.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   What do they do?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.640]   They have all their focus and their attention on one another.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.520]   They're so engaged and interested in one another.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.640]   They listen to one another carefully.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.820]   The man looks across the table at the woman and just thinks about how much he loves her
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.720]   and how much he loves listening to her.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.920]   What can happen if you're not careful?
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.320]   The familiarity of marriage can breed contempt.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   Stop listening to one another.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.440]   Now you have all these ridiculous jokes about men not listening to their wives and tuning
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.840]   them out, etc.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.960]   Guess what?
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.760]   Not a good formula for success.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.360]   You stop doing what made you successful.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.880]   Now there are changes in the same way that you would never expect a healthy, successful,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:28.840]   10-year-long marriage to look as juvenile as the affections of a young courting couple.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.720]   I would be concerned if I were interacting with a couple who's been married 10 years,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:40.640]   I'd be concerned if their love was as immature as a courting couple.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.000]   But I want to see the basic foundations continue.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.440]   I want them to continue in my marriage.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.920]   My wife and I are coming up on our fifth, this January 1 will be our fifth wedding anniversary.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   So I want to see the foundations are still there, but there should be a greater expression.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.240]   It's the same thing with any kind of success that you've had in your life, especially financial
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.240]   success.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.640]   There will be a growth, there will be a maturity, there will be a deepening, there'll be a growth
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   to your life.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.400]   But you want to make sure that you're identifying those basic things that have been working
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.560]   that you need to keep doing.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.200]   Understand where the success came from and then what you need to do to sustain it and
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.120]   to grow it.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   That's my message for you today.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120]   It's a brand new day.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   It's a brand new month.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.760]   I hope this is encouraging to you.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:40.000]   Second step for today is set that appointment with yourself, with your spouse.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.720]   Few hours, you in a notebook with your cell phone and a Facebook turned off.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Spend some time thinking.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.480]   If you're not a writer, get out the voice dictation system on your phone.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.520]   If that doesn't work for you, just record voice memos.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.280]   Get your thoughts out of your head and into some place that you can look at them.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.240]   Think about what's gone well, what hasn't gone well, and what you want the next year
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.520]   of your life to look like.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.880]   If you are just getting started, start with just those three areas, personally, professionally,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   financially.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.480]   If you have done this before, maybe take Michael Hyatt's life score assessment.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:23.160]   Use his questions, intellectual, marital, emotional, parental, physical, social, financial,
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.560]   vocational, avocational, spiritual.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.840]   Use all those areas and do a more comprehensive form.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.440]   The format doesn't matter.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.400]   It's the action that makes the difference.
