[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040]   - Well, I can't think of many conversations
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.120]   that are harder to have than those we have
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.520]   with professing believers who have shown
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.320]   little to no fruit in their lives over the years.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.140]   Those are hard conversations to initiate
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.240]   and to do really well.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.360]   Today's question arrives anonymously.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.320]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.640]   In episode 803, you tackled the question,
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.960]   how do I wisely tell a professing believer
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.120]   I don't think he is saved?
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.360]   I'm now struggling to consider how to apply
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.440]   the principles you put forth in that episode
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.240]   with an elderly professing Christian
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.600]   who I think may be unsaved and who is close to death.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.480]   In thinking about this,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.060]   I thought about your love for dying saints
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.600]   and figured that in your pastoral experience,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.280]   you have been with dying individuals
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.200]   who profess faith in Jesus,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.120]   but yet you have strong inclinations
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.960]   that they may not actually be saved.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.360]   How do you personally speak
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.800]   to these seemingly nominal individuals,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   especially elderly ones when they are so close to death?
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.080]   That's a really good,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.940]   a real practical question.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.240]   I have indeed stood beside the bed
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.760]   of dying professing Christians whose faith
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.920]   I was not at all sure was real.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.440]   And this is especially frightening
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.640]   when I know the person has sat under my ministry for years.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.440]   And the reason that's so especially frightening
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.480]   is because I know I don't have much more to say
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.860]   than what he's already heard
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.780]   and he has already given evidence
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.320]   that they had no effect on him.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   Now, of course, that's not always the case.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.920]   Often, the dying person who's a professing believer
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520]   whom a believer is not sure whether they're real,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.080]   often that person has gone to a church
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.800]   where the gospel is rarely, if ever, mentioned,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.120]   and where the scriptures are not believed and taught.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   So the person has, perhaps, a completely wrong notion
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.440]   of the whole issue of salvation.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.900]   And perhaps they have wholly wrong notions
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.640]   of what God is really like.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.620]   And the situation is often complicated
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.160]   by the fact that at this season in life,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.400]   their mind may not be able to think very clearly
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.080]   or feel very intensely.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.200]   You know, my dad was an evangelist
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.520]   and I heard him preach numerous sermons
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.160]   in which he quoted for young people,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.200]   Ecclesiastes 12, one,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.860]   remember your creator in the days of your youth
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.800]   before the evil days come
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.760]   and the years draw near in which you say,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   I have no pleasure in them.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   In other words, the end of life season may be such
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.960]   that the capacities for joy and delight
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.040]   and treasuring and pleasure are gone.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.720]   We may have sent them away.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   So what do you do now?
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   I would suggest four stages of kinds of interaction.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   And you may jump into these stages
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   of kinds of interaction anywhere along the way.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.160]   I'm gonna give them in a particular order,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   but it depends on what you know about the person,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.480]   how much they know,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.440]   whether each of these would receive the same emphasis.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   Number one, saturate this entire time, season.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.120]   It might be that they're dying for weeks or days or hours.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   Saturate the entire season with pleading love.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.600]   My guess is that this person
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   may have never experienced anyone looking him or her
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   right in the eye and saying with seriousness
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.840]   and even tearful emotion, I love you.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.760]   And I don't want you to perish.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.880]   I don't want you to be lost.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.800]   I want you to be saved by Jesus.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.280]   I want you to be brought into Jesus' fellowship forever.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.960]   I want to be with you in heaven.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.320]   And I am concerned for your soul.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.280]   Very, very few people have ever heard a Christian say that,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.240]   which is sad.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.800]   Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5 20, I implore you,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.400]   that is I plead with you on behalf of Christ,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.200]   be reconciled to God.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   Most of the time when we speak of the gospel,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.680]   we narrate facts and we must, of course.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   The gospel is news, factual news, but not enough.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.880]   It's not enough to give facts.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.800]   We have to look at people and plead with people
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.960]   to be reconciled with God.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   Seldom do we actually embody, so incarnate the love of God,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.000]   the love of the Father going out to the prodigal
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.560]   and pursuing and seeking and longing and pleading.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.040]   That's the spirit that this season right now,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.640]   the last days or hours of life should have.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.520]   Number two, second observation.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.760]   Be sure that they know that God
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.080]   is a God of holiness and justice
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   and therefore wrath against all sinners,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   including us and them, is our biggest problem.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.160]   Give them a few passages to remind them
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.360]   that the greatest problem of mankind
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.640]   and their greatest problem lying in that bed right now,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.400]   their greatest problem is not whether they're hurting
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.120]   or can breathe, their greatest problem
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.880]   is the holy and just wrath of God.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   Romans 1.18, 2.5, Ephesians 5.6, 1 Thessalonians 1.10.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.920]   Pick out a verse or two to bring authority to your reminder.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.080]   Remind them of coming judgment.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.160]   It's just so sobering to me to read every time I get there,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.520]   and I just read it in my devotions yesterday.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   Hebrews 9.27, "Just as it is appointed for man to die once
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.600]   and after that comes judgment."
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.000]   Tell them, warn them.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.680]   So often we're so eager, and secular people
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.560]   will just get furious at what I'm saying right now.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.960]   So often we're so eager to give them peace right now
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.000]   so that the last thing they can do is have peace as they die.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.480]   To hell with such a thought.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.360]   If the person is about to drop into eternity
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.640]   where they will know no peace forever,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   they need to know judgment happens after you die.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.840]   Here's the third observation.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.520]   Clarify the heart of the gospel.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.480]   God sent Jesus to bear his own wrath
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.360]   and to cover all our sins as a perfect substitute.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.720]   Talk about the objective facts, yes, yes, facts,
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.400]   of the divine transaction that happened on the cross,
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.000]   and talk about these facts before you say one syllable
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.960]   about what's expected from this person lying there in bed.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.120]   It was a glorious thing to me to discover
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.400]   at some point in my life where somebody said,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.800]   "Don't you realize the gospel is the factual,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.400]   objective transaction between God and Christ
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.680]   on your behalf before you ever existed?
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.400]   You were saved before you were existed.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.360]   You existed in the decisive transaction that happened
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.800]   in the covering of your sins
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.560]   and the providing of your righteousness."
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.840]   And that now the question is, "Will you have it?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.440]   Will you receive the gift?"
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.680]   So give him those facts.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.160]   And I could read a lot of them here,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.920]   but Romans 3.25, "God put Christ forward
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.960]   as a propitiation by his blood.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.720]   This was to show God's righteousness
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   because in his divine forbearance,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.480]   he had passed over former sins."
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.840]   1 Peter 3.18, "Christ suffered once the righteous
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.440]   for the unrighteous to bring us to God."
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.400]   1 Peter 2.24, "He bore our sins in his body on the tree."
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.840]   Hebrews 9.26, "He's appeared once for all
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.800]   at the end of the age to put away sin
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.320]   by the sacrifice of himself."
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.440]   Romans 8.1, "There's no condemnation
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.960]   for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.720]   All five of those texts say nothing about faith,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.840]   nothing about obedience, nothing about repentance.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.160]   These are facts.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.600]   These are realities outside of us.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.920]   And then comes the rest of the gospel.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.480]   You can't earn this,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.800]   so don't worry that you can't get out of bed.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.440]   Don't worry that you don't have a lifetime in front of you
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.520]   to obey and try to earn this.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.680]   You're like the thief on the cross.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.880]   You got one hour before you meet him, and guess what?
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.960]   It's a gift to be received in an instant,
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   not to be earned in a lifetime of obedience.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.440]   And you plead with them, "Receive the gift,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.880]   the wages of sin is death,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.360]   but the free gift of God is eternal life," Romans 6.23.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.960]   And then you offer it, you offer it
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.760]   with your hands stretched out.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.240]   Then you say, "Throw yourself on God's mercy.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.200]   Embrace Jesus as your only hope
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.960]   and as the all-satisfying treasure
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.680]   that he's gonna be for you forever,
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.960]   satisfying your soul forever,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.840]   your Savior, your Lord, your friend,
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.800]   your treasure from now to eternity."
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.560]   Maybe even show them the vanity of self-sufficiency
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.680]   with that little parable about the tax collector
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.360]   and the Pharisee where the Pharisee said,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.480]   "Oh, I'm better than everybody,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.680]   and I tithe and give my..."
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.440]   I never committed adultery.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.040]   And this poor tax collector standing afar off
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.520]   would not lift up his eyes to heaven.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.600]   He beat his breast saying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.200]   And Jesus says these unbelievable, yes, believable words.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   I tell you, this man went down to his house justified
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.120]   rather than the other,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.840]   for he who exalts himself will be humbled
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.640]   and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.720]   Can you right now, can you, my friend,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.360]   humble yourself and cast yourself
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.480]   on the mercy of Jesus like that?
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.240]   And the last thing I would say, number four,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.080]   spend the rest of the hours or days speaking
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.840]   or reading to them about the glories of Christ.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.200]   According to 2 Corinthians 3, 18,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.240]   we are changed by beholding the glory of Christ.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.640]   We behold the glory of Christ in His word and work.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.440]   They need help from you to remember those, to see those.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.960]   I was thinking maybe, if you're wondering,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.640]   how would I do that if they live for another three days
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.720]   and I get to sit with them for eight hours?
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.760]   How would I do that?
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.680]   And one resource would be, I wrote this little book,
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.680]   "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ,"
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.680]   precisely for unbelievers who might,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.800]   in looking at about 13 pictures of the glories of Christ,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.280]   be awakened to the beauty of Christ.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.520]   So that's one possible resource,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.720]   whatever, whether it's scripture or a book
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.880]   or your own testimony, keep reading
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.720]   as long as they will let you,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.840]   and keep praying as long as they will let you,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.800]   that God would open their eyes.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.560]   - That is a glorious recounting of the gospel, Pastor John.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.960]   So good to hear the old, old story once again, myself.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.160]   Thank you.
