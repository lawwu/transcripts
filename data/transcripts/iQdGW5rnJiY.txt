[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   So that's what today's episode is going to be an interview. I did on the Jordan Jordan Harbinger
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.520]   did of me on his show, the Jordan Harbinger show, that interview. So it'll be instead of me talking
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.880]   to someone else about them, it'll be someone else talking to me about me. I thought that'd be a fun
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.840]   change of pace. So that's what we're doing for this show. And then of course, next week, we will
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.840]   be back with our sort of regularly scheduled content. So anyways, I'm always a fan of what
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.440]   Jordan does on his show. And I think you will be too. After you hear this episode. Hope you enjoy
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:44.480]   the interview. Well, thanks for coming back on the show, man, you are one of my favorite people
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.520]   to talk to when it comes to this type of stuff. And actually, frankly, not to torpedo my own
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   compliment here, but I have to say you're actually one of the only people that I will talk to when it
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.640]   comes to this stuff about productivity, and and the like, because I think largely over the past
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   few years, I have also become increasingly anti productivity. And some of that culminated with
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.480]   COVID. Although it could be 2020 hindsight, I was during COVID, I was like, fat, not a shape,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.680]   stressed, working till 8pm. Every day. I was always on the red line. And I remember just
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.840]   playing with my two at the time two year old son and I couldn't get up off the floor because I was
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.040]   too fat and stiff from sitting in my chair. And I was like, this is this is not good. And I looked
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.440]   at like, what do I have to show for it? I didn't even have zero inbox. I wish I could say I did.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.240]   But I didn't write I just had like, my Twitter feed was all answered or something. It was just
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.360]   like, very ungratifying. And I think you're you sort of captured that in this latest book is like
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.840]   people are fed up with doing more. Yeah, I mean, I think people aren't anti productivity really so
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   much as they're anti overload. Right? Like this idea of I have too much to do, which doesn't just
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.080]   mean I'm really busy, because I have a lot of things to do. But it also means that the administrative
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   overhead that comes with each of these tasks is now starting to pile up to the point where I'm
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.600]   barely actually making progress on any work, like the state of overload is uniquely deranging.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.040]   And I think the pandemic put a lot of knowledge workers into that mode. And they personify that
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.920]   frustration by saying, well, you know, screw you productivity, right? Because I mean, you think
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.200]   about loosely, what is productivity? I don't know, like trying to do more, like trying to produce
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.800]   more, and more is the absolute less thing I need. So I mean, I think the pandemic, a lot of people
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.960]   had your same experience, which is overload got to a place where it's side effects became
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.880]   intolerable. Something has to change. The hard part was figuring out what, but I think most people
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.360]   agreed something had to change. Yeah, for me, I started with the physical, because a friend of
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.000]   mine ran a personal training company, he was like, you need a trainer. And I was like, Oh, I'm not
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.840]   going to say no to that. Because that's, that's just fact at this point, if I can't get up off
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.040]   the floor from playing Legos. So that started things, but then it was like, well, I'm feeling
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.120]   good and playing with my kid more. So maybe I will put some tasks aside. And I sort of almost
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   accidentally discovered some of this where I was like, you know, now that I actually feel good,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.960]   I don't want to spend any more time, I don't want to spend time going in the opposite direction by
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.680]   like, trying to do more busy work. And I think I'm not like you said, I'm not the only one.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.600]   There's this growing anti productivity sentiment during the pandemic. But aside from other people
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.200]   going through it in the pandemic, at the same time, it seems like there's more happening with
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.120]   this because people are actually taking action. They're not just feeling it. They're starting to
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.760]   go to hell with this, right? That we heard of quiet quitting. It's kind of related to this.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.600]   Oh, I know it. Yes. Yeah. I wrote a New Yorker piece about this a couple years ago that got some
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.920]   attention. So yeah, I'm pretty familiar with it. What can you tell us what that is? For those of
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.440]   us who probably don't even have never heard of this? Well, the way I see it now is quiet quitting
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.840]   was actually one of several waves of reform disruption within knowledge work that happened
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   because of the pandemic. So the quiet quitting wave, this was largely Gen Z, though it did extend
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.040]   beyond there, sparked by TikTok. So it got sparked by TikTok and then spread through other social
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.800]   media. The idea was to do the bare minimum at work. So I'm not officially quitting. I'm keeping
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.360]   my job, but I'm not going to do almost anything beyond the bare minimum. And it's usually the
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.960]   sentiment was expressed in a sort of antagonistic employer employee relationship. Like I am about
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.480]   more than my labor. I'm going to stop going above and beyond. I'm just going to work the bare
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   minimum. It spread really fast because of social media virality. It also kind of got squashed
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.840]   pretty fast because there were some pretty obvious, I would say, reactions to quiet quitting
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.120]   that were less than positive. But I say more generally, this was a piece I wrote a few months
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.440]   ago. This was one of multiple waves of similar disruptive sentiment that swept through different
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.520]   age groups within knowledge work after the pandemic arrived. I understand the desire to do
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.800]   something like that, but it's actually really good if you're the type of person who can put the work
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.240]   in because if all your if all your colleagues are quiet quitting and you're like, I'll take the lead
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.400]   on that project, that's that ends up working out for you. It's almost like there's this funny tweet
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.560]   I saw or whatever it was the other day. And it was like, I'm just saying that if I was a billionaire,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   I'd tell all my competitors would be competitors that the secret that the secret is getting up at
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.760]   430 in the morning. Have you seen this? It's like, like all these, but yeah, I get up at 230 in the
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.840]   morning and I do a three mile swim. And it's like, when do you when does this guy sleep? When does
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.240]   he actually get work done? And I guess this comedian was just like, you know, we all know
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.800]   that that's not true, but it's really great. You're just torturing all the people who are on your
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.840]   coattails to far away from ever accomplishing anything. Yeah, I always imagine, you know,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   Jocko Willink, sleeping in the 10am every morning with his his auto scheduled. Yeah, that would be
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.200]   funny to find out. Yeah, yeah. Right. Going on benders every night, right? It's the benders
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.640]   aftermath and it's the weights with the chalk and the sweat and it's like, you check the metadata,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.680]   the photo and it's like 8pm the night before. It'd be funny though, because if most knowledge
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.440]   workers were to do Jocko aftermath photos, like what would we have? It would be like
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.960]   our keyboard sort of askew or like inbox, like smoking a little bit. Right. I just slam through
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.320]   500 slack messages in the last in the last seven minutes. But I mean, look, zooming out on it,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.080]   zooming out on it. Like, why did we have these various waves of disruption? It was quiet quitting,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.560]   but it wasn't just quiet quitting. We also had before that the Great Resignation, which was
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.080]   later 2020, and in the 2021, which was across all economic sectors, but had a strong subcomponent
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.520]   about knowledge workers. So basically, older knowledge workers who could left work, right?
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   Like, okay, I'm going to go to part time and go to no time, I'm going to retire early. So we had
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.120]   that big go through that big sweep go through. And we had the remote work wars happened as well,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.560]   like a lot of unrest about a lot of energy and what exactly the schedule was going to be working
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.720]   from home or from the office, or we have to go back to the office. My argument is all three of
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.240]   those are symptoms of the same underlying disease, which was people had become increasingly
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.520]   frustrated with overload and knowledge work, a problem that started in the early 2000s,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.480]   it got worse and worse, and they got pushed over the edge in the pandemic.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.640]   And in some sense, those were understandable, but misplaced reactions to this more fundamental issue,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.560]   which was knowledge worked the way we were running it, especially the way we're
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.040]   thinking about productivity, knowledge work, it just broke. And so then everything went haywire.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.760]   And we start getting all these different reform movements and people spreading virality and
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.680]   complaining and quitting all these different things all happened in response to the same problem.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.000]   What I thought was interesting was it wasn't just the United States or West, North America,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.840]   whatever. I see this in China, and you hear you read about it in China, I think they call it
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.320]   something like laying down. And it was basically it's a little bit different because it has to do
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.160]   with the Well, actually, it's probably quite similar to what Gen Z is doing, which is,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.680]   all right, I'm never going to be able to afford a house, I'm never going to be able to get a job
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.560]   that pays anything close to what I need to survive, like my parents did based on, you know,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.640]   inflation or whatever, because wage growth is completely stagnated. And so I'm just not really
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.320]   going to do anything. And so there are these people in China that were like, never, I'm never
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.760]   gonna, I'm not going to get a job at all, I'm just going to lay flat, it's called lay flat.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.920]   And it really was a lot of the same sort of causes as we have here, I'm sure there's more to it. But
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.320]   it was like, yeah, I'm just I'm never going to be living even the same way as because in China,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.000]   of course, they had this massive mobility from like, your grandparents were like turnip farmers.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.880]   Hey, it's Cal, I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   then you need to check out my new book, slow productivity, the lost art of accomplishment
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:06.240]   without burnout. This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:13.360]   you can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow. I know you're going to like it,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   check it out. Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.280]   - Your parents worked in a factory or something like that, and then bought a flat in Beijing.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.640]   And now you're like, you grew up in this totally modernized environment. It's like,
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   where's my mobility? No, you're gonna maybe stay right here, but probably go down a notch.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.880]   - Right. And you're like, I'm already here. I mean, I'm already living in my parents flat. So
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.760]   why do I need my own? Yeah, I'm not leaving the turnip farm.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.200]   - Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like, or that, yeah, the flat in Beijing, like, okay,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.560]   I'm never really going to be able to afford my own one of these things. So why should I work
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.800]   90 hours a week just to not be able to marry anyone because there's no girls because the
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:57.040]   one-child policy. It's like, no thanks. Your new principles of slow productivity are simple,
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.440]   but not simplistic, right? So one, do fewer things. Okay. I think a lot of people don't
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.400]   switch the podcast off just yet, right? Two, work at a natural pace. This is a hard one for me,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.800]   and we'll get into why, probably because nobody really knows what that means. Three, though,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.480]   was my favorite, of course, which is obsess over quality. And I wish more people would say that,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.440]   and I wish more people especially would do that. So backing up the truck a tiny bit,
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.360]   what does productivity mean in the first place? Can we get to like a core definition of that?
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.240]   So we have a starting block. - Well, let's start with the
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.600]   broken definition. - Okay.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.360]   - So my argument is the implicit definition that arose once the knowledge sector became
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.920]   a major sector, which is in the 20th century. The implicit definition was visible activity
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:49.520]   is a useful proxy for productive effort. So pseudo productivity, which substituted activity
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.600]   as like a heuristic, seeing you doing things is better than seeing you not doing things,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.360]   that became the dominant mode for thinking about productivity and knowledge work,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.560]   which is very different than the way we were thinking about these ideas in the industrial
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.400]   sector, the agriculture sector. I think this is important is that in the industrial sector,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.080]   it was quantitative and clear, right? It's Model Ts produced per labor hour invested.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.680]   Agriculture is very clear, bushels of corn per acre of land that we're cultivating, right? You
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.200]   had these numbers and these ratios, you had clearly defined production systems, and you
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.360]   could tweak that system and see what the number did. And like, oh, when we changed it this way,
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.880]   we produce more Model Ts, that's a better way to build Model Ts. Now, a lot of the issues with,
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.440]   I think, people's complaints with productivity and knowledge work is that they implicitly
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.240]   shift that mental model from industrial manufacturing, agriculture to knowledge
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.720]   work where we don't actually use it. We don't actually use ratios and knowledge work because
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.480]   there is no clear thing we produce. Different people work on different things. We work on lots
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.960]   of different things at the same time. There's also no clear production systems to tweak.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.120]   Productivity is personal. It's up to you how you organize and manage your work. So that doesn't
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.160]   really work in knowledge work, but we pretend like that's what we're still doing. So it's why,
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.000]   when you see like a magazine writer, you know, in 2020, writing about productivity and knowledge
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.200]   work, they'll be bringing up Frederick Winslow Taylor, right? The famous scientific management
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.280]   guru with a stopwatch that was trying to make people's motions more efficient. We actually
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.440]   don't do that in knowledge work because there is no well-defined process to make more efficient.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.400]   There is no movement to look at and say, how do we do this faster? There is no number we're trying
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.840]   to improve that we can sort of relentlessly drive people to do. So what we're doing instead
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.160]   is pseudoproductivity. Like visible activity is better than none. So let's all come to an office,
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.120]   look busy. You know, the boss is here. They can see you there. If we need to get ahead,
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.840]   let's work longer hours, show up early, stay late. And that's what we were using.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.760]   My argument is that when it mixed with the front office IT revolution starting in the 2000s,
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.040]   so we have networks and mobile computing, that's when that definition really began to fall apart
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.480]   because email, chat, laptops, smartphones, this made it possible in a very fine-grained way to
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   demonstrate activity at all times at a very small level of granularity. And that's when the wheels
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.600]   fell off the bus. So now it's constant messaging back and forth, constant meetings. It's where work
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.640]   took this turn towards the fully clearly nonproductive performative. And that's what
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.840]   things became deranging. So that's where we are. Pseudoproductivity was fine for about 50 years,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.720]   doesn't play nice with email, does not play nice with smartphones, does not play nice with Slack.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:41.120]   So work became intolerable in the 2000s. So we need a new definition. And so my definition of
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.040]   slow productivity is an approach that focuses instead on the actual long-term production of
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.920]   stuff that has value. The big stuff that matters. Are you producing good stuff at a reasonable rate
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:58.080]   over a long period of time? - Yeah, the busy work over the... So rushing through meaningless tasks
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.800]   instead of sitting down to do deep work, I suppose, as per one of your previous works.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.560]   Is toxic the right word or is that just an overused word? It seems quite toxic, right? It
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.200]   seems quite like a bad path to be going down. Because when I worked in Wall Street, this is
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.240]   like 2006. So we had email, of course, we had BlackBerrys, but we had Outlook or whatever.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.120]   It was, am I in my office? Are you shooting emails back and forth that include a partner
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.240]   so they kind of know that you're there? Am I on the phone, on a conference call, in a room with
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.760]   other people? Basically, is that billable hour ticker thing that you fill out at the end of every
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:43.200]   day or every project, is that thing... Are there blocks dropping in that thing or are you doing
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.960]   something that can't be measured? So with a lawyer, it was a little bit easier because you're
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.720]   measuring billable hours, but you still then would be like, "Oh, I went to the bathroom and I thought
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.920]   about this and I even talked about this while I was there, so I'm going to bill that." I mean,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.800]   there were literal times where we'd come back chuckling because we're like, "I just billed
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.640]   that piss." It was like 60 bucks. It's ridiculous, but it was really what we were doing.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:11.200]   And yeah, man, this must be so much worse now. All we had then was email and we had an electronic
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.080]   tracker that we filled out billable hours by the client. Now there's email, but there's also
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.840]   texting and there's also Slack and there's also phone calls and there's meetings, but some of
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.640]   them are virtual and they're on Zoom. Some of them are in person and some of them are... There's just
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.800]   all kinds of infinitely new ways to do nothing, really. And at least when you're a lawyer,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.400]   you say, "We're billing for this." Right, at least you get paid.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.080]   Yeah, there's a direct connection. I charge while I was in the bathroom, I'm going to make money by
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.920]   it. In most other jobs, the problem is you're taking that lawyer style freneticism not only
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.840]   without getting paid, but it's also directly getting in the way of the work you need to do.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.480]   So you're like, "In the moment, staying on top of my email and Slack and meetings is
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.240]   pseudoproductivity purified and it's going to make me seem like I'm being productive,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.800]   but I still have to write the report at some point that I prom... I still actually have to
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.000]   do the work. So I'm going to have to wake up early or do it at night." And so it's uniquely
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.040]   deranging, right? Because it's not only are you constantly in this activity, but the activity is
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.520]   preventing you from doing the actual projects that need to be done as well. So you're having
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.920]   to work even longer hours. So that's what makes it hard. If at least you said, "I'm getting paid
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   for every email I send." You're like, "This is hard, but I'm racking up the dollars." But instead,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.440]   you're having to send emails all day knowing that this is directly going to make your life worse,
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.040]   not better. And that's really difficult, I think. We had FaceTime, which was like make sure that
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.440]   you're in the office when the boss walks by. But the reason you had that, not only so that everybody
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.760]   knew you were there like punching in late, but it's because there were people there doing real
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:54.160]   work at late hours. But then reading your book, I was like, "Oh yeah, why are they there at 8 p.m.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.640]   on a Sunday?" Well, because during the week, they can't get shit done because they're getting calls
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.880]   and emails. And someone's like, "Lorna, can I pull you into this real quick? We're waiting for a fax
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.520]   from Deutsche Bank." Okay, and I have to sit in the room while y'all wait for the fax because
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.080]   then we can bill the client for my hourly rate in addition to the other 20 associates who are
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:20.320]   sitting here. And it's like the untold thing, the untold sort of grift was, "Yeah, if there's 30 of
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.880]   us waiting for the fax, we bill like thousands of dollars per hour. But if you're over here doing
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.800]   something else for another client that could be done later, then you can't bill for that and bill
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:36.080]   for this." So it's like they would rather have you sit, and this is probably not unique to lawyers,
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.600]   there's probably a brand of this for every profession. They would rather have you sit in
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   the meeting doing nothing and then come in on the weekend and do the other thing for the other
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.240]   client than just stay in your office and do the thing for the other client and not go to that
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   meeting that you weren't needed at at all because then you can bill for those two things separately.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.280]   Does that make sense? There's some version of that for every profession though, for sure.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.720]   Yeah, but it's just much worse, right? Because I mean, the other thing, I was talking to a friend
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:09.120]   recently who was telling me about his friend who's in Wall Street, I forget exactly what type of
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.560]   banking, they might be a hedge fund, I'm not exactly sure. But anyways, she was telling him
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.800]   about how some of her younger employees were like, "Why didn't you answer my email?" or whatever.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.720]   And like, "Oh, I was going for a walk or I was with a friend or whatever." And her answer was,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.000]   "Look, if you want to do those type of things, get a different job. We're compensating you here.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.920]   It's hard, but we're compensating you for what's hard." And I hear the same thing from lawyers,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.720]   like young lawyers, is they're often given the message, "Yeah, this is really long, annoying
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.800]   hours, but you can't say we're not compensating you for that. So if you want less money,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.400]   go get another job and you'll have more flexibility." The problem is we've taken
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.800]   that Wall Street elite law firm also mentality and we're taking the worst of that without the,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.200]   "Well, at least you're being compensated." - That's a good point.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.680]   - That's the problem with it is that if you're just working, you're a university professor,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.040]   you're just in the marketing department, you're a development director at a nonprofit,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.080]   it feels more like Wall Street felt, like law firms felt. I'm jumping around doing all this
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.360]   work, but without the real reason behind it, other than this pseudo productivity mindset,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.960]   which is not, and this is where I differ from some of the anti-productivity movement,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.720]   is that it's not that the, at least in my analysis, it's not that the pseudo productivity mindset
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.240]   is easily translatable or reduced to some sort of zero-sum relationship,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.840]   some sort of antagonistic relationship between management and labor.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.120]   It's more arbitrary and cultural than that, right? So the pseudo productivity mindset,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.240]   let's stay busy all the time and demonstrate activity. It's not a particularly good way
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.720]   of producing valuable output, right? It's not making your company more profitable, right?
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.840]   And so it's not that, okay, it's zero-sum. It's good for the company, but bad for the employee,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.400]   and we're butting heads against it. No, it's more of a cultural idea that emerged without
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.560]   consensus that was explicit. It's just like what we fell into once knowledge work emerged.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   And then like the water getting hot slowly with the frog in the pot doesn't realize that he's
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.080]   being cooked. That's what happened when the IT revolution came and began to make this increasingly
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.800]   intolerable. It happened a little bit every year. And I get into this. You can watch it get worse
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   and worse, but a little bit every year. And then we looked up at some point, and we're like, man,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.400]   this is really on email a lot. We're really in a lot of meetings. I'm not getting a lot of work
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.080]   done. It happened gradually. It's not being imposed by one group on the other for some
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.680]   sort of zero-sum purpose. And that makes it sort of uniquely difficult, that it's not helping
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.000]   anybody, and yet we're all stuck in it. - Yeah, we are all stuck. It's funny you should mention
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.400]   that we're all stuck in it because, look, if you're being pulled into meetings that you don't
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.960]   need to be in, that sounds like a bad office environment if you're doing that. But I work alone
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   in my underwear half the time. I'm still engaging in pseudo-productivity on a regular basis. Sure,
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.720]   no one's like, hey, Jordan, can I pull you into this meeting? No, you can't. It's not on my
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.120]   calendar. That doesn't happen anymore. But I'm still making sure that I don't have any DMs on
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.520]   this social media thing that come from, or making sure my inbox is cleared and I'm doing a terrible
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.760]   job because there's so much stuff in there right now 'cause I just got back from Japan. But it's
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.440]   really, pseudo-productivity is still present even if you're not in a company with a boss. We're
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.480]   just now doing it to ourselves. And some of that might be my Wall Street programming, like that's
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.040]   what a job is, just doing a bunch of meaningless crap all the time. But I think if everyone is
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.640]   doing this and not everybody worked at a white-shoe firm on Wall Street, then this is almost like,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.280]   it's something in the water. - It is in the water now. Yeah,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.920]   because it's all we knew, right? I mean, knowledge work is a thing, is widespread thing,
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.960]   is pretty new. This is like the 1950s and '60s. The term knowledge work is coined in 1959 because
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:02.160]   it wasn't a big enough sector of work, the sector where you use your mind to add value to information.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.200]   It just wasn't a big enough thing to even label until the mid-20th century. So all we've known
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.600]   is pseudo-productivity. So it is in the proverbial water. So if you're an entrepreneur, if you're a
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.240]   freelancer, if you're a solopreneur, you don't have a lot of other options to even think about.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:22.400]   You're like, this is what work is. And if I'm not, in some sense, people who work for themselves
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.360]   can be the worst practitioners, like the most intense practitioners of pseudo-productivity,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.800]   because you also have fear and guilt driving you. Like, I need this to work, and I'm willing to do
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.880]   what it takes to be successful. Like the mortgage payment depends on it. And if the only lever you
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.560]   know to pull is pseudo-productivity, you're answering those emails, man. You're jumping
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.120]   on those calls. You're leaving no stone unturned. And it's why I say at the end of the book,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.080]   slow productivity is a alternative definition to pseudo-productivity.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.920]   But probably the larger project here is to have alternative definitions writ large.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   And there could be many of them. But just to get people thinking, what is my definition of
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.040]   productivity? What are its principles? How do I pursue it? Like to have a menu that's not just,
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.680]   you should be jumping off and on calls about funnel marketing or whatever. Like,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.720]   have options that are not just pseudo-productivity. And I think that's as important of a consequence
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.320]   of what I'm trying to do as even the details of my particular pitch, is break people out of this
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.040]   mold, teach the fish what water is. Hey, pseudo-productivity is not destiny. And in fact,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.520]   it's a pretty terrible way to organize cognitive labor. Like, let's start thinking of alternatives.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.720]   - I like your slow productivity concept, which is essentially, and I'm paraphrasing as usual,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:41.840]   reorienting your work so that it's a source of fulfillment instead of overwhelm. And the lawyer
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.080]   example might be a little tricky, just because you're measured on billable hours. So there is
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.680]   a way to sort of measure your productivity. But I know you mentioned in the book also,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.240]   doctors with crazy patient schedules might have trouble implementing some of this stuff. There's
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.200]   still plenty that I think they can do. I would imagine if you really sat a group of doctors down,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.600]   you could say, what's taking up a bunch of your time? And there's going to be all kinds of crap
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.080]   that they could outsource or have somebody else do, or that they're doing to themselves, because
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.240]   that's how they got through medical school. So they're used to doing all the extraneous crap.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   I'm curious what the pandemic did to speed things up. We kind of talked a little bit about these
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:26.480]   Zoom calls, I think are one of the gross examples of this. I know people that love these things.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:34.080]   I don't. I go outside and walk and refuse to use my camera. And I remember during the pandemic,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.640]   it was like Zoom coffee chat with friends. And I just remember being like, I love you guys,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.400]   but this is the last thing I want to do with any free time is be on Zoom even more. It was like,
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.000]   I ended up trading Zoom calls with friends and family in Australia or whatever, people that I
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.960]   love, in order to do Zoom calls for work or talking with other entrepreneurs in the podcast
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.520]   space in a hangout. Like, oh, this is the worst. A lot of like drinking by yourself,
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.680]   but with a camera in front of you. Right. Yeah. Like, have a glass of wine in my kitchen.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.360]   And then the time zone's all weird, right? Everyone's in New York and it's like 7 p.m.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.920]   and they're like, yeah. And you're like, it's four. This just feels weird and wrong. And I have
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.080]   so much stuff I got to do after this. And I just want to take a nap. Yeah. All right. So here's
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.480]   what I think happened in the pandemic. There's two things that made it worse. So one has to do
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   with workload. So one of the big ideas is we're very, we're bad at managing our workloads and
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.600]   we should care about it. Right. Because the issue is everything that's on our plate brings with it
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.880]   administrative overhead. Right. So like everything I say yes to, that generates emails, that generates
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.240]   meetings. I have to support this thing I've agreed to do. So as you say yes to more and more things,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.120]   more of your time has to be servicing the administrative overload of all the things
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.080]   on your plate. Less time is there to actually make progress on the tasks themselves and everything
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.600]   begins to slow down. So workload really matters. And the way that most people implicitly manage
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.120]   their workload is with stress because there is no, in most knowledge work circumstances,
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   no transparent way of saying how much are you working on and how much should you be working on
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.800]   and how do we manage how much you're working on? We don't do that. Right. In knowledge work,
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.880]   we're like, ah, it's up to the individual, you know, like that's up to you. It's none of our
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.320]   business. So what people do is stress. They say, I keep saying yes because there's a social capital
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.960]   cost to saying no. I keep saying yes until I feel sufficiently overloaded by my workload
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:34.000]   that that psychological distress gives me cover to say no. It's worse now. That feeling of overload
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.480]   is now worse than the feeling of saying no to another person. And therefore, I can now start
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.640]   saying no. The problem with that heuristic is it keeps us like right at the red line.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:51.120]   Like it keeps our workload exactly at the point where I can barely handle this. Right. So we
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.760]   always have like 20% too much work to do. So what happened with the pandemic for knowledge workers?
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.840]   Overnight, you got like a bonus 20% worth of tasks, right? Because we have to shift our operations to
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.080]   run remotely. Like it generated a bunch of tasks overnight. So we have a lot of knowledge workers
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.840]   at the red line. And then like overnight, hey, let's add 20% more tasks we can't avoid. It pushed
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:19.600]   people over. I think that was one. Two is more simple. We do in person a lot of quick ad hoc
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.640]   interaction. I grab you after another meeting, like Jordan, what's going on with, you know,
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.400]   client X and we can just like figure it out in a minute, have a quick back and forth and figure it
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.440]   out when we weren't in person anymore. And I was like, OK, Jordan, we need to talk about client X.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.320]   We would say, well, let's just set up a Zoom meeting. Here's my Calendly. Here's my Calendly.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.440]   30-minute blocks. And I'm like, I have a 230.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.960]   That's the problem. It's 30-minute blocks. So we also began expanding a bunch of two-minute
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.000]   conversations into 30-minute conversations. Right. And also keep in mind, those two-minute
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.120]   conversations were well placed. Right. It wasn't just I would just run and burst through your door
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.880]   no matter what you were doing. Like, talk to me about this now. It'd be like, wait till I saw you
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.840]   in between things or you're getting coffee. There's time you were. Yeah. So it was time that
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   was otherwise unspoken for. Right. So then that created the Zoom apocalypses where we had meeting
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.400]   after meeting after meeting because we were expanding a lot of the ad hoc into 30-minute plus
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.880]   blocks on our calendar. So those two things, we were at the red line and we got pushed over by
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.920]   20 percent. And then we had like a big increase in meetings. The best number I saw was from a
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.040]   Microsoft annual work survey. They found a 252 percent increase in these type of meetings from
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.280]   2020 to right now. And by the way, that number's not going back down. It like came up. Oh, shoot.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.000]   I was going to say, but it reset a little, right? No. Oh, man. Because we went to hybrid work.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.760]   And so it got bad. Right. So, of course, that pushed people over the edge. But it was the
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.680]   underlying reason why we were set up for that to push us over the edge is in a pseudo productivity
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.280]   regime, you're like, hey, activity is all that matters. You don't think about things like
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.640]   workload. You don't think about things like when do I work and how much should I work and what's
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.800]   the what's the optimal load of things to work on and how should I spread things out? It's like,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.640]   I just do activity. And like it kind of worked and it was stressful, but it kind of worked.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.760]   And then we shook things up with the pandemic and it was like eight hours of Zoom. It's you're
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.280]   working at four in the morning on writing stuff so that you can clock in for an entire day of doing
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.800]   virtual meetings. Like it just it pushed a bad situation towards the absurd. And I think that
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   was just that was too much for a lot of people. You know, it's funny. This reminds me there's
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.520]   a company, a very popular company in Silicon Valley that I probably shouldn't name just
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.480]   because of what I'm about to say. There was a my friend worked there in sales and he's this
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.000]   alarm went off when I was in his office and I was like, oh, he's like, oh, it's just a meeting.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.920]   And I was like, oh, OK, well, I get up to, like, walk out because I'm thinking you got to go to a
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:57.200]   meeting. He goes, oh, I don't have to go to that. I was like, are you sure? Like just because of me,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.280]   because I can come back, we could grab lunch later. He's like, no, no, I'm in sales. We don't
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.200]   have to do any of the meetings. I was like, you don't have to go to meetings at all. And he's
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:12.080]   like, no. And the CEO name, like, you know, household Silicon Valley tech CEO says that
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.640]   anybody in sales, we just don't have to go to the meetings. And it's funny because so and so came in
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.240]   here was like, I want to see you at this meeting and did it. And I was like, nope. And he went to
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.160]   the boss's boss's boss. And the guy was like, he doesn't have to go. He's in sales. And I thought
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.920]   that was so telling. Right. They have all these meetings. You have to go and you've got to go to
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.800]   this and you've got to go to that. Oh, wait, you're one of the people who actually makes money for
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.040]   this company. Do not come to this meeting. You need to be doing your thing. We need the money
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.360]   for the company. And I thought that was so telling, like these meetings are so important unless,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.240]   of course, you get paid by outside parties, in which case this is completely not a thing you
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.040]   need to do. And it's like so it's really not that important if you don't need the salespeople there
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.760]   because they're the ones that generate revenue, then you probably don't need the other 80 people
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.920]   that got invited out of the hundred that are just showing up because their calendar
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.400]   outlook thing went off and they don't want to say no to the big the big guy upstairs.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.200]   I want to take a brief break from my conversation with Jordan Harbinger to talk about one of the
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:14.240]   sponsors that makes this show possible. That is our longtime friends at Grammarly. Look,
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:21.520]   how you write matters in the knowledge economy. The clarity and effect effectiveness of your
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:27.280]   writing is probably the most important thing you do in terms of showing your abilities,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.240]   your professionalism, having success, actually getting ahead. Writing really matters.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.040]   This is why I like Grammarly. It is your A.I. writing partner that will help you
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:44.160]   get your work done faster and at higher quality. It works in the apps and devices you're already
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   using to do your writing. It is like having a virtual editor looking over your shoulder
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.480]   and helping you make that writing possible. Now, what I like about Grammarly is that they
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.000]   have always been ahead of the curve on integrating A.I. into their tools, even early on. It was just
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.920]   A.I. to help you figure out when there's grammar mistakes to improve. Then their A.I. got better
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.520]   and it could start doing things like tone detection. Hey, what's the tone of what I
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.000]   just wrote here? How could I make this more professional or less professional? And now,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.920]   as they fully embrace the power of generative A.I., it could even help you come up with ideas,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.840]   write first drafts of things. It brings those generative A.I. smarts directly to the tools
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   where you are already doing your writing. Ninety-six percent of Grammarly users report

[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:49.200]   Also want to talk about the Defender 110. We're talking about an automobile here, folks.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.240]   Moving up, we're getting pretty classy, Jesse. I appreciate this. I am a classy guy.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:00.960]   This is an iconic vehicle. We like to write about here about craft producing really quality things
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:08.160]   over a long period of time. Well, that's exactly what you get in the Defender family of vehicles.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.840]   The new Defender 110 has been redefined with a thoroughly modern design. The exterior is
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.600]   reimagined with compelling proportions and precise details. The interior is beautiful,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:26.080]   fantastic materials. The integrity of the design is, for people who care about craft,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.640]   this is what you should be impressed by. Look, the capability of the Defender is, of course,
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.800]   legendary. Whether you're facing off-road challenges or harsh weather conditions,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.840]   it's built for the modern explorer. It has that sense of adventure built right into it.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.160]   You take this classic legacy, this beautiful design, and you throw into it innovations like
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:55.280]   intuitive driver display and award-winning infotainment system. So you've got the old
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.960]   with the new, the adventure with the comfort, and the whole thing is built so carefully and it looks
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.600]   so good. Ready for a wide range of adventures, the Defender family features, in addition,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:13.200]   the two-door Defender 90, the Defender 110, and now the Defender 130, which can seat up to eight.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.640]   This is a vehicle made to go further, the Defender 110. Learn more at

[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.600]   Now let's get back to my conversation with Jordan Harbinger.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.680]   Yeah. I mean, I think that exactly highlights the issue of so much knowledge work is because,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:38.400]   again, if we're not in sales, we don't have this number we can point to of like,
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.160]   this is what I'm generating. And when we started doing this, that number went down.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:48.720]   Most of us don't have this. That's what allows these really suboptimal, weird cultural implicit
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.200]   consensus type of behavioral patterns to emerge. And I think it's exactly what you're saying is
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.480]   incredibly telling. You find a knowledge worker where there's a clear indicator of their output,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.640]   and you begin to see like what actually makes sense. Oh, these meetings mean you sell less.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.520]   That's what you do that's important. So you shouldn't have to do those meetings. We'll
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.160]   figure it out. We see the same thing with programmers, right? Like Silicon Valley
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.320]   figured this out at some point. Writing computer code is very industrial. I mean,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.360]   it's a knowledge work thing, but it's industrial. You're building a product.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.240]   A product, yeah.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.720]   And they realize like, okay, our main thing, our main piece of machinery that builds this product
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.040]   is human brains. And it's really hard. It has to think and write computer code. And so they
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   figured that out a long time ago. Also, leave the programmers alone. We're using a sprint
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.880]   methodology. Like in the morning, we will check in, what are you working on? And only one thing,
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.000]   only work on one thing. What is it? What do you need from us? Good. We'll check in tomorrow.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And you just put your head down and code because it turns out like that's how you produce really
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.320]   good computer code. And if you start making the programmers go to a bunch of meetings and
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.240]   be on unrelated Slack all day, the thing doesn't ship.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.760]   And what kind of art do we want in the break room? What? Do you want this to work or not?
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.520]   Most knowledge work, it's not so clear because you're doing seven things. And it's a different
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.200]   seven things than what you were doing. And some of them are non-promotable activities and some
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:14.640]   are core activities. And so it's just anything can arise. It's the obfuscation of process and
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:22.000]   knowledge work allows for all sorts of weird sort of pathological behavioral patterns to emerge.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.120]   And so I think that's a great example where the rubber clearly hits the road. Another example,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   where else do we see this? Literary novelists, people who write novels that are award caliber,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:39.360]   they famously disappear. And the entire work culture surrounding the publishing industry says,
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.040]   yes, novelists in between their books, we leave them alone. They should not be doing podcasts.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.480]   They don't need to do social media. We don't want them doing anything but thinking and writing
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.840]   because you know what? If your book is great, it's going to sell like 5 million copies and
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.280]   everyone's going to talk about it. It's going to be Oprah's going to recommend it. And that's what
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.360]   we need. That's our product. So just don't do anything else except for try to write a great
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.520]   book. And so novelists famously disappear. And then they come back when they're done with their
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:13.120]   novels. When the rubber hits the road and it's clear, the way we work looks nothing like most
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.960]   knowledge workers work. But the thing is, is most knowledge workers actually have, if you really
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.640]   pull back the layers, this is the two things you do that creates the most value for our company.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.800]   And if you did those things better, it would be really useful for our company. We are preventing
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.960]   you from doing those things better, but because there's not, here's where we landed on the
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.800]   bestseller list, or here's how long, how good the code is, or here's how many sale dollars you
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.840]   brought in, because it's not directly observable. We prevent people from still doing like the core
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:43.840]   things that that's their most valuable contribution. - I love this message. And I love if
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.600]   there's something you said in the book that was, you kind of touched on it earlier in the show,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.280]   how we manage our workload is problematic because we're always on the edge of that burnout.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:57.600]   And one of the reasons being, the discomfort of saying no to something new has to be greater than
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:03.680]   the distress we cause the other party by saying no to something new. So basically, like, you have
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:12.000]   to, we have to be so tormented by saying, by our workload, that it's actually, the only answer we
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.200]   could possibly give is no, and that washes away all the guilt we feel by saying no to something,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   even if it's totally unreasonable, not related to our core task. And I think that sort of speaks to
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.160]   why the idea of doing fewer things sounds a bit scary, because to some people, it sounds like
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.560]   accomplish fewer things, and it's not really that, is it? - No, it's not that at all. I mean,
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.960]   it helps people sometimes when I append it to say, do fewer things at once, right? Because
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.640]   really what we're trying to do here with that advice is reduce all that administrative overhead,
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.280]   right? So like, we can use hypothetical numbers, but you know, imagine everything I say yes to
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.000]   brings with it a certain number of emails and meetings that I just have to do to support the
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.520]   thing, to talk to people about it, have meetings about it, right? So if I have two things versus
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.880]   four things on my plate, that's going to have the number of emails and meetings on it. But those
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:09.200]   emails and meetings clog the day, they clog the schedule, they make you have to shift your
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.600]   context back and forth, they reduce your ability to think clearly, they fragment your schedule,
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.480]   so you have less longer periods of time to work. So the amount of total productive work per day
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.320]   has gone down. So when I have four things on my plate, the average productive effort
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   towards finishing things per day is much smaller than when I had two. So when I have two things on
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.520]   my plate, I actually finish them faster. And not only do I finish them faster, but I finish them
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.440]   at a higher level of quality, and I'm happier because it's not this whole deranged, you know,
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.360]   I have no time to actually do the work. And hey, what can I do when I finish those two things?
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:46.000]   I can bring two new things onto my plate. And so now, how long did it take me to do those four
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.080]   things? Probably not nearly as long in the scenario where you did two at a time and then the other two
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:58.160]   versus when you just said yes to all four at the same time. So doing fewer things not only makes
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.760]   work much more sustainable, you become better at working, right? Like if you can just bootstrap
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:09.200]   into this, it's not going to be long before your star is on the rise. Like Jordan is shipping,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.160]   look at this, like good stuff. Like he did this and this and this and this, and it all looks great.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.920]   But your secret was like, yeah, because I only did one of these things at a time,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.440]   you know, and it led me to actually do the work. - It's funny, a lot of other podcasters or people
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.200]   in the media space will be like, how do you produce three episodes a week? It's so much,
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.560]   they're different. You read the book for every guest that comes on the show.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.880]   And the answer is, yeah, but I'm not doing other stuff, right? I don't have like a product thing.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.680]   I'm not also on the speaking circuit and writing a book. And you know, I've got two kids. How do
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.640]   you manage all this? I just read the book and I do the interview. I don't have 17 other irons
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.720]   in the fire. The problem is I get FOMO, right? I see other people, I'm like, oh, Cal's got a new
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.800]   book. I should probably write a book. But you have to focus on this stuff because you're right,
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.120]   it gives you that psychological space to innovate and focus on quality, which we'll get to in a
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.760]   minute. And you know, I used to not really be a believer. I was like, I can switch context,
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.880]   no problem. But I really can't. And maybe I'm just getting old now, Cal, I don't know.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.760]   But going from, I'm going to do a bunch of email to I'm going to sit down and read and take notes
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.680]   to then going, I'm going to do a live show or whatever, like a recording. It doesn't work.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.440]   And I don't know, did it never work and I didn't notice it? Or am I just too, am I getting slower
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.760]   jumping between like performance mode podcast than reading than email? I don't know. I don't
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.680]   know the answer. No human in the history of the human species has been able to do that.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.240]   When you're younger, you have a little better, you have a bigger pain tolerance, right?
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.880]   This is just neurochemistry. Like it takes time for the human brain to change its target of
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.440]   attention from one thing to another, because inside your brain, you have to start inhibiting
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.600]   certain neural networks and you have to begin exciting other networks. It takes a while.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.760]   It's the clearest way to measure. This is just think about when you sit down
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.000]   to do something that's very hard, like write something right or read something difficult.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   You know, there's that like 10 to 15 minute period where you're like, this is really hard.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.240]   I really don't like this and I'm not making much progress. And then you feel like you're
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:17.120]   sort of getting into the flow of it. Well, it took 10 or 15 minutes for your brain
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.840]   to load up all the right programs. And so when it starts feeling easier is because your brain
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:27.040]   has now fully switched its attention frame to what you're working on. So if you're switching
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.440]   back and forth between things, you never allow yourself to ever settle on an attention frame.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:36.720]   I mean, it's why checking email and answering emails is actually one of the most cognitively
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:43.440]   distressing things we do as humans right now, because it's taxing our brain in a way that it
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.360]   absolutely can't do because every email in that inbox is associated with its own attention frame,
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.440]   its own cognitive frame. And they're often, by the way, highly salient. It involves other
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   people we know who need things from us. Potentially they're upset or there's like
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.160]   our relationships on the line. And one email after another means we're switching from one
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:08.880]   frame to another, to another, never giving our brain anywhere near enough time to actually switch
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.640]   the cognitive context over. So we're trying to wrestle with these things without the right things
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.400]   loaded in our brain. It's mismatch. We get that cognitive grading. It's exhausting, right?
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.800]   I mean, there's a hack out there for email that I like that speaks to this. And it seems weird
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.360]   at first until you understand attention frames. But the hack is you go through your inbox and you
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.920]   take all of the emails related to the same thing. And then you sort of move them into their own
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.440]   folder and then you deal with all of those. And then you go in and get all the other emails of
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.200]   a different type. And then you move those into a folder and deal with those. If you try this,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   you'll realize like, oh, this is much easier. It's because you're giving your brain time
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:53.120]   to shift its cognitive frame. And then it's easier to do. So I don't think we realize the cost.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:57.280]   And I honestly think like jumping to an email inbox, back to work, on the Slack, back to work,
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.560]   on the social media, back to work. For a cognitive worker, it is the equivalent of an athlete,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.200]   like someone who depends on their body for a living. That's, let's say, taking tequila shots
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:14.800]   in between matches, right? Like that same effect that has on our ability to run really fast and
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.200]   like throw balls accurately. We're doing the same thing to our brain, but no one realizes it. You
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.680]   know, like, of course we're miserable. - Yeah, it's funny. You're right. And I never thought
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.600]   about this, but I do the email triage where I'm like, okay, this is important. And when I have
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.040]   space, I'm going to hit this. Let's like start or whatever. But then there's people who are just
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.080]   like, hey, I just found your show and I really like it. Or, you know, hey, I've been listening
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.320]   for five years and I have a question about that. That goes into a separate folder. And I've noticed
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.600]   that when I go through that separate folder, I can do like a hundred emails in two hours.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.840]   But when I'm in my inbox where I'm doing triage or in the starred ones where it's important,
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:56.160]   I can do like 20 emails per hour. So maybe, what does that end up being like 40 to 60, 80 emails
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.960]   in the same amount of time I could do a hundreds in the other folder. And it's because, yeah,
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   there's one, when I'm cruising on one lane, I can really do that stuff fast. But you're right,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.360]   if I'm switching lanes and you don't think about it as switching lanes, because you're like, it's
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.880]   just email. It's like, now you're thinking about your schedule. And then this next one, you're
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.920]   thinking about, do I want this person on the show? And then in this next one, you're thinking about,
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.000]   can I join this conference? And then this other one's like, we want you to do a keynote. You're
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   like, oh, is my keynote a fit? It's a completely different game and it takes like five times as
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.880]   long. - It's productivity poison, right? I mean, we just tell ourselves this story that I'm just
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.080]   answering messages, but it is torture. And when you think about it, you realize that, like,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:42.000]   it's the thing that exhausts us most is a diverse inbox of a bunch of different stuff. Yeah. Which,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.960]   by the way, this is why if you're doing fewer things, everything gets better because you have
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.480]   less things generating email and meetings. So the emails you have, there's less context represented
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.920]   here. You now have the space to work on one thing for a while. I mean, it makes all of the
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.360]   difference. It's a light switch difference in both what you're producing, but in just the
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:09.120]   subjective wellbeing you experience while working. Like getting fewer things on your plate at once
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   is like the biggest positive change you could make in your knowledge work life.

[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.400]   - At some point, people are going, right now people are thinking, okay, great. How do I say
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.680]   no to work, though? Go back to what you guys are saying about telling my boss, no, I don't want to
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:57.200]   do this. That, I think, is, well, it's like the trick, right? What do we do? And I love this
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.440]   tactic, if I can call it that, in the book, where most of us, we just say something like, oh, I'm
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:07.520]   really busy, I can't. But instead of that, we say, well, okay, I can't start on this project for
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:13.680]   about six weeks, then I've got four other projects competing for that slot, so tell me why this needs
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.880]   to happen during that. And I know if I asked you to do something and you told me that, I'd just be
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.520]   like, never mind. And I think that's kind of the idea, right? - Yeah. I mean, so this is like,
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:29.120]   most of that chapter is on how do you get away with this. Because if you have control of your
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.640]   own schedule, and let's be clear, if you're an entrepreneur or a solopreneur or whatever,
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.440]   it's not that this is trivial, right? Even after you get over the psychology of doing fewer things,
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.200]   it's not that it's trivial, but there's like one key trick if you're an entrepreneur,
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.560]   which is you can't reduce what you're working on each day if you don't reduce the number of
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.000]   projects you're working on, and you can't reduce the number of projects you're working on unless
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.320]   you reduce the number of missions you're pursuing in your job. So start from the top down. Like,
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.400]   simplify at the highest level what you're trying to do, then you'll have less projects you're
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.600]   working on, and then, so that's the key trick for there. But if you work for someone else,
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:08.480]   most of the ideas that I give are based on making workload transparent. Like,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.040]   just like you were saying, like, the biggest thing that helps support pseudoproductivity
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.320]   is that no one talks about their workload. It's all informal. And so everyone sees everyone else
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.920]   as a vessel to make their life easier by executing work that they need done. And when they just see
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.320]   you as a black box work-executing vessel, it's like, this would be great if you could do this,
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.000]   and it's annoying to me if you can't. What you need to do instead is break that
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.240]   mental model by making your workload transparent. And there's a bunch of ways to do this,
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.680]   but, like, the simple way – here's, like, the vanilla way of doing this that's actually really
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:45.680]   effective – is that you keep track of what's on your plate, and you divide it between actively
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:50.720]   working on and queued up for me to work on, right? So you make a distinction of the things you've
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:56.080]   said yes to, actively working on, queued up to work on, and here's the order it's coming.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:01.040]   And you let other people into this context. And so someone comes up and says,
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.680]   "Hey, can you do this for me?" One way or the other – you can word it however you want to
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.960]   word it – but one way or the other, you're basically saying, "Yeah, sure. Here's my workload
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.680]   tracker. Just throw it on there at the end of the queue of things that I'm waiting to work on,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.240]   and, like, let me know, like, what I need to do it or that I should call you when the time comes."
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.200]   Now they have to confront two things. One, "Oh, he's not actively working on this yet. It's at
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.800]   the back of this queue, and until it gets up here, he's not actively working on it, so no emails,
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.880]   no meetings until he's actively working on it." Two, they get a realistic picture of your workflow,
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.720]   and they realize, "Oh, OK, he's saying yes, but all of these things have to get done first,
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.040]   so it might be a while." So either I'm going to say, "You know what? It's not that important,"
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.440]   or my expectation is going to be recalibrated, or if I'm your boss, I say, "No, no, this has
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.080]   to be done now." You're able to bring them into the workload process, be like, "Great, I'm with
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.720]   you. Help me choose what to move out. I'll swap this in for something up there. You let me know
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.840]   which one is lowest priority." They're now involved in that as well, right? And they now have to
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.400]   explicitly – and I'm saying this in a way that sounds somewhat confrontational. The book talks
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.960]   about how to do this, you know, without just being like, "Hey, boss, use my spreadsheet." But
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.240]   essentially, this is the mindset that completely changes people's relationship with work assignments.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:24.480]   - Man, I love it, because instead of no, it's no, and here's a bunch of great reasons why, or yes,
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:30.240]   but here's also why. I can imagine someone being like, "Hey, get on that such-and-such report."
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.360]   You're like, "Great, all right, it's going to fit in here May 3rd," and it's like March 25th,
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.040]   and they're like, "Whoa, what are you talking about?" "OK, if you want me to do it now,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:44.240]   that's fine, but then you and I have to tell this other partner that I can't actually work
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:50.080]   on his thing because I'm doing your TPS reports," and it's like, "Ew, let's not stir that can of
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:50.960]   worms up." - Let's not stir that.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.120]   - Yeah, maybe I'll give it to the other guy who's just sitting there with his thumb in his nose.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.800]   - Well, and then so, like, here's another way of doing it that's less, you know,
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.600]   concrete, right? Like, another thing I talk about doing is to implement the same idea,
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:09.840]   is when someone asks you to do something, you find a time on your calendar for it and schedule it.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.440]   Great, this is going to take 15 hours, I got to find 15 hours, and I'm going to protect it,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.280]   right? It gives you a time management advantage, right, because now, like, you don't have to
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.600]   schedule stuff once you've already scheduled it, but it gives you a realistic confrontation
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.480]   with your schedule. So now you're looking for 15 hours to schedule something. You got to find 15
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:33.120]   hours, and it might be a month until you can find those 15 hours, but if you're clear, like, "Hey,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.000]   I'm really careful about managing my time, and I schedule every project on my plate,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.240]   I schedule when I'm going to do it, and this is when I could find the next 15 hours clear,"
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:49.120]   you're accomplishing the same sort of idea as the to-do list, and it's more unimpeachable than you
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.480]   would imagine, because part of what happens is you get a reputation for being careful about your
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.640]   time. You don't get a reputation for being difficult. You get a reputation for being
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:03.280]   careful about your time. That earns you trust. So, like, "Well, you know what? But this guy over
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.600]   here, he's always, like, haphazard in doing stuff," or, "I don't trust that he's really
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.280]   busy. I think he's just disorganized. Hey, I'm going to—you just get this done." But you're
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.840]   the guy who's like, "Yeah, no, no, no, no. Look, I manage everything on my calendar, and I always
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.240]   deliver when I say I'm going to deliver. I know what's on my plate, and when I say I'll do this
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.360]   on this day, you get it." You've just earned yourself a lot of trust. And then they're like,
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.320]   "Oh, okay, so I guess you're too busy for this," because, again, it's helpful for people if you
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.840]   say yes, but they're not thinking that much about you. What they're thinking about is, "I want to
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.760]   get this thing off my plate. Hey, Jordan, can you do this? Well, blah, blah, blah. Okay, whatever.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.120]   Hey, can you—they're just going to move on to someone else." They're not sitting there stewing.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:41.760]   >> Right.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.200]   >> And as I tell people also, you already say no to things, right? You don't just happen to have
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.240]   the perfect number of things being thrown at you that exactly fills your schedule. You're saying
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.960]   no to things. That's why your schedule is exactly full. This just means you're probably saying no
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:02.320]   to more things, but no one keeps track of that ratio. There is no break room where the CEO and
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.400]   the CFO are in there, and they have your name up on the wall, and they have the number of times
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.240]   you've said yes or no, and they're plotting it and being like, "You know what? This ratio has
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.920]   changed in the last couple of months. I don't like this at all." No, you're like a black box.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.800]   Sometimes you say yes, sometimes you say no. They're talking to a lot of people,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.280]   and that's another reality is reducing your commitments by like 25 percent.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.480]   No one even notices that. It's still like you say yes, you say no. I don't know the exact ratio.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.800]   It doesn't feel different enough for them to notice, but for you, that could be the whole
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.080]   ballgame, a completely different experience at work. >> You know, I'm not recommending anybody
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.800]   do this, but it reminds me again when I was on Wall Street. These corporations are so dysfunctional.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:47.040]   It's kind of funny. There was a young lady who only wanted to do a very specific type of work,
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.480]   and they would give her things that were not that, and she would go, "Oh, no. I really am only doing
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.600]   this," and they would go, "Okay," and I asked her, "So what are you doing if you don't have
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.280]   enough of that kind of work?" She's like, "Oh, I just read." I'm like, "Read what?" She's like,
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.520]   "Books," and she was always reading, and I'm not talking about like law books. I'm talking about
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.800]   like novels. She just, you know, caught up on whatever, Harry Potter or whatever, and I'm like,
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.880]   "You're going to get fired." She's like, "Oh, well," and during her performance review, they
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.840]   were like, "You billed like 20 hours this quarter. Everyone else billed you like 400 or whatever it
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.160]   was," and she's like, "Yeah, I just wasn't getting enough tax work or something," and instead of
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:30.000]   being like, "You're fired," to their credit slash or whatever, this company, this law firm was like,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.440]   "We really need to make sure that you get more of this type of work," and I was blown away,
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:38.160]   because I thought, "You are going to get kicked out of there so hard. You better bring a parachute
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.040]   to work. They're going to throw you out the window," and they didn't. They tried to accommodate this,
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.760]   and that blew me away, and of course, at that point, I was like, "I got to try some version
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:53.440]   of that that won't get me fired," and sure enough, you can say no to certain kinds of work.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.960]   Now, if there's something everyone needs to work on, you don't say no to that, right? You're a
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.840]   team player getting it done, but if people are just dumping crap off on you, it never occurred
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:06.880]   to me that you could be like, "Oh, you know what? No, I'm not going to take part in that," and there
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.920]   was a lot of sort of like shit rolls downhill at these corporations, and some people were just like,
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:19.360]   "Nope, not doing it," and they totally got away with that, which is actually shocking, and to your
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:26.480]   earlier point, I know that there's a lot of ad hoc that goes around, like the overload that goes
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.840]   around work, and I know, I'm pretty sure, I'm not the only person who would get an email and is like,
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:38.960]   "I really don't want to deal with this today. I'm hungry. Let me ask a question about something
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.280]   logistical and ping pong this off a few more people so that I just, I'll look at it tomorrow
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.760]   when those replies come in," or I'll like boomerang this for a week after asking a question about
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:52.240]   something that I could have asked at the meeting. I think we probably all do that stuff, and it
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.560]   makes everyone's problem worse, and we do it because we're overloaded, right? If I had the
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.160]   space to deal with it, I'd be like, "Yes, I would love to do this. Let me get started on that.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.680]   Where's the plan? Let me get together," but since I don't, since I'm already on the red line,
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:09.520]   I just make more busy work for other people because it's like a temporary, it's like I can
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.880]   come up for air by doing that and then dive back into the sea of crap that I've got to deal with.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.200]   Yeah, I call it obligation hot potato. It's like this is on my plate right now,
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.160]   so that's a source of stress. If I send an email about this to you, no matter how nonsensical or
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:29.840]   unproductive or ambiguous, it's not on my plate in the moment, and I get a little bit of relief,
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.320]   and so you get the like thoughts, you know, like question mark. I mean, that's just because it
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:40.960]   gets you off your plate. I saw this, for example, in response to something I suggested in Deep Work,
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:46.800]   my book from 2016, where I had a very common sense suggestion about email. It was called
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.960]   process-oriented email, but I was like, "Look, if we're being very rational about this, you know,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.680]   if you sit and think before you write an email about some sort of project or request, if you
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:01.520]   really think through what really needs to happen here and you spell it out, 'All right, here's what
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.600]   we need to do. We need to reach this decision. Here's the steps that are required. Let me spell
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.240]   out how we should do this. Let me lay out the process. Like, I'm going to suggest these times,
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.000]   and I'm going to put them in this document, and you take a look on them, and everyone takes a
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.160]   look on them, and by Wednesday, everyone marks which ones that work. I'm going to check in on
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:23.040]   that document Thursday morning. I'll pick the time that works in the middle." And like, if you laid
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:28.880]   out the process of like how the work was going to unfold in your original email, you can prevent
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.280]   needing to have another 25 back and forth messages, each of which requires a bunch of inbox
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.520]   checks. It's much better. There was this question, like, "So why aren't people doing this?" And
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:41.840]   they're like, "I just, I don't have nearly enough breathing room or space. That would take like 10
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.920]   minutes to write that email message. I can't do that. I have to just thought, you know, like,
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.840]   get that off of my, like, well, are you available that day?" You know, "Oh, it's off my plate,"
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:55.520]   right? It's another consequence of overload. But I liked your example about the law firm,
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.680]   because this is actually, in Wall Street, like, this is a real thing. I was getting real numbers
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:05.360]   for this here in D.C. My lawyer friends told me about this. It is a thing in these big elite law
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:11.760]   firms in D.C. where you can leave the partner track and say, "I'm going to be a specialist,"
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:16.720]   right? Like, "I just do like this type of compliance with this law. Anyone who's working
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.640]   on a case that has this, I can come work on just that thing," right? And it's considered inside
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.960]   the firms to be non-prestigious because you leave the partner track, right? Like, partners, you have
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.880]   to do all the crap, right? But I got the numbers from people. And I was like, "Well, if you can
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:36.800]   become a managing partner at one of these firms with bonus, it's like a $1 million to $1.2 million
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.400]   a year annual compensation package, your life is like hell. But it's like a $1 million to $1.2
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.240]   million." And they're like, "Yeah, but these specialists, they don't get a profit cut.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:50.640]   Honestly, they, like, top out at, like, $600,000." I knew you were going to say that. And I was like,
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.480]   "That's amazing," right? It's amazing. Yeah. You're like— You work one-third of the hours.
[00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.080]   One-third of the hour. It's a huge salary, and it can be made more reasonable. But it's even better
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.240]   than that. In a lot of knowledge work firms, you can make yourself one of these non-partner track
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.120]   specialists without having to trade off the money. The trade-off you have to make often to do this,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.080]   where you say, "This is what I'm doing," the trade-off you have to make is accountability,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.400]   right? That's how— There's risk in it. But in a lot of firms, non-law firms, which is, like,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.920]   normal type of knowledge work firms, you can say, "I'm going to specialize on this. Measure me.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.360]   Like, this is what I do. And if I'm not, like, bringing the rain, like, hold me accountable for
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.680]   it." But you can trade accountability for accessibility, right? Because most people,
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.040]   the trade-off is, "I have to be emailing all the time. I'm in pseudo productivity,
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.360]   but it's low risk." It's like, I can very consistently look productive. All I have to
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.600]   do is be willing to send emails all day and jump on Zoom meetings, and it's all obfuscated. I have
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.520]   a lot of flexibility. I don't even have to really be doing a lot of work, right? I just have to be
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.880]   really busy and kind of stressed out. If you trade that for accountability, people will leave you
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.000]   alone. But you have to deliver. Like, typically, it means, like, "I'm just going to do this. And
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.280]   this stuff I do is going to be great. And if it's not, like, this is not going to work out,
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.800]   you might have to fire me." But if it does work out, the flip side is I don't do 17 different
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.480]   things. I don't do— There's nothing to do Zoom meetings. We'll check in once a week. Leave me
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.920]   alone. - Yeah, that's— Man, it's incredible. That's— I did not know that that was an option
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   at any law firm. That's a really good career track. That's a really— On Wall Street,
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.960]   it's more like partner track, or they pigeon you into this one sort of, like, council area,
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.160]   and you stay there until you jump back in or you leave, right? It's kind of like,
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.480]   "You're not going to make partners, so you should go work at Visa and have a lifestyle change."
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.840]   - You know who's innovating, and I think it's relevant, who's innovating the law firm space
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.240]   now is there's an increasing number of— There tend to be more boutique firms run by women.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   And the women seem to be much more willing than the men, which is obviously stereotyping here,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.440]   but they seem much more willing than men to experiment with different models, revenue models,
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.600]   right? And so you have these women-run law firms that are emerging where they say, "Our model is
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.880]   not our maximization," right? It's not, like— Theoretically speaking, which is how most big
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.520]   law firms run, theoretically speaking, what is the maximum number of dollars that this number
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.360]   of people can generate using their brains? And they're instead thinking, like, "All right,
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:21.040]   here's our job. We want to, like, get paid well and, like, get good compensation and have reasonable
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.880]   hours. We're really smart, so why don't we find a way to use our smarts to, like, make a good
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.640]   salary and do, like, really interesting high-level work but not try to maximize the money we make?"
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.720]   And it turns out, like, law could be a fantastic job if you're doing a third of the hours. It's
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   fascinating, interesting work. And because a lot of people are realizing, like, a third of the money,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.880]   well, fine. Okay, so it's not $1.2 million. It's, like, $350,000, $400,000. But, you know,
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.960]   so what? If we start as, like, that's a giant salary if you're not comparing yourself to other
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.120]   people, if you don't have to belong to the Chevy Chase Golf Club, if you can do this remote. A lot
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.920]   of these companies are remote first. Like, I live in Asheville, North Carolina now. Why do I care
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.880]   if, you know, like, $400,000? I'm a king. You know, I've got the nicest house on the block.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.280]   Why do I care? You know, this is great, and I'm working 30 hours a week. That innovation is great,
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.360]   but pseudoproductivity doesn't support it because pseudoproductivity says activity is what matters.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.840]   Doing less activity is bad, and that's just it. - Man, I'll never forget one of my professors who
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.040]   was a managing partner at a Chicago law firm. He was also, like, he commuted to Michigan,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.760]   which is quite a drive, and he would teach this class on law firms and legal careers. And he was
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.560]   an interesting guy, you know, a typical sort of high-level law partner. He's like, "Yeah,
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.760]   I belong to a golf club in Ireland. It's $40,000 a year. I've been there once in four years." And
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.600]   you're like, "What the heck? That's an expensive round of golf." But somebody had asked him
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.040]   something like, "Are there part-time options at law firms?" And he goes, "No, not really. Unless
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.200]   you're a woman and you're pregnant at that particular moment, not really. And even then,
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:01.440]   not really." And we were like, "Why?" And he goes, "How many of you would work half as much for half
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.360]   the money?" And, like, everyone in the whole class is like, "Yeah!" And he's like, "That's why." And
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:12.640]   we're like, "But isn't that kind of okay?" And he's like, "Well, benefits and stuff, and it adds
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.080]   up." And it's like, "But can't we sort of account for that? What if I buy my own health care? Can
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:26.000]   then I work only 45 or 60 or whatever it was hours a week? Can we not figure this out?" And he just
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.080]   was like, "Hell no." But this was 80, 100-hour work territory, these kinds of firms.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.160]   Well, you know who is experimenting this better is entrepreneurs. Now, when entrepreneurs
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.440]   fall into the slow productivity mindset. So now it's just you negotiating with your own psychology.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.000]   They're innovating with a lot of these ideas. And I really push — and I talk about this a
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.200]   bunch in the book — is, like, if you're an entrepreneur, you can experiment massively,
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   right? Like, here's an example. It's an entrepreneur. It's a solo shop. She, like,
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.880]   does coaching, and then she has maybe four or five sort of part-time virtual-type people,
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.040]   right? So it's like that scale of a shop. And she figured out at some point, she's like,
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.360]   "Here's what I'm going to do. I take two months off in the summer." And she's like, "Okay,
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.800]   it's not too hard to work out. You have to be a little bit careful with your contracts,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.560]   but it's not too hard." And she lost about, if you do the math, like 20% income, revenue.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.600]   - Okay. - Right? She's like,
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:27.040]   "That's a super fair trade. This is great. Like, 20% less revenue, and, like, July and August,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.800]   I can take completely off. Yeah, I'll take that trade. Like, the numbers are arbitrary. Who cares
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.920]   20%? Like, I'll do that, you know, I'll do that all day," right? I have a writer friend who does
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.000]   that. Takes three months off. I do this with — I'm not an entrepreneur, but kind of am,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.600]   right? I'm a professor. - Yeah, you kind of are. Yeah.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.600]   - Yeah. So I realized at some point — people don't realize that if you're at a research
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.960]   institution as a professor, the school pays your salary for 10 months. And the two months over the
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.400]   summer, they don't pay your salary. And so, like, what most people do is their research grants,
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.240]   they ask in their research grant budgets for what's called summer salary. And that's where
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.800]   you fill in those last two months as it's coming out of your grants, right? And that's just what
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:13.280]   people do. And in fact, the push I had was — when I first started was, "Well, if you — you can get
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.920]   three months, technically speaking, if you have three different research grants, you can take a
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.720]   month of summer salary from each and actually get paid three months' worth of salary in two months.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.800]   And that's what you want to try to do." But the thing is, that means you're doing all this work.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.120]   And I figured out at some point, I said, "Well, what if I just didn't do that?" Like, I just
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.160]   didn't ask for summer salary and grants, and I just didn't work on academic stuff in the summer,
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.320]   and I just sort of disappeared and went to do England and, like, wrote books or whatever.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.440]   And it turns out, "Oh, yeah, it's 20% less money, but yeah, you can do that."
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.720]   Except for your books are bestsellers, and you're probably massively in demand
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.000]   on whatever speaking circuit and stuff. So I think you've maybe figured out how to plug the gap, Cal.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.320]   Yeah, but it was an awareness of, like, "Oh, that's an option." Like, "Oh, that's just a
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.480]   trade. It's 20% less money, but you get the summer off." And there's a lot of professors
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.960]   who make that same trade who don't also write books and do whatever. What they do is they
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:12.880]   just adjust their spending. Like, "Let's just pretend my salary is 20% less. This is so worth
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.960]   it. I can take the whole summer." So a lot of professors who don't do research will teach
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.880]   summer classes to try to fill in their salary. And those are really hard because you do, like,
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.760]   a semester's class in two weeks. It's, like, five-hour days. Yeah. And I know a lot of professors
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.680]   who are like, "Well, what if I just spent 20% less and took the summer off?" And they're like,
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.240]   "That is so much better. That is so much worth it." So anyways, there's a lot of innovation.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:40.240]   I know people that do seasons on, seasons off, too. It's like, "I work really hard and then I
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.080]   take a season off and work another season." Like, they go back and forth. There's a lot more
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   innovation and models once you break out of pseudoproductivity. And if you work for yourself,
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.880]   everything is on the table, right? You're just playing with these, like, income-spending ratios.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.600]   You have so much flexibility on your table.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.840]   There's some stuff I want to say in the show close about working at a natural pace,
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.440]   but in the interest of time, I think we can kind of blow past it a little bit because
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.800]   you're touching on some of it right now, right? Like, you're making that longer-term kind of
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.120]   vision of what you want your life to look like. And working in seasons, I love this idea.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:19.360]   Our mutual friend, Jenny Blake, does this. And she's funny because whenever I look at her phone,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.120]   she always has, like, 74 unread text messages and my skin starts to itch. I'm like, "Oh, gosh."
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.280]   I wonder what you think of that as somebody who's like, "Hey, email's overrated." I'm like, "Yeah,
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:35.120]   but do you have 74 unread text messages? That just makes me have some sort of weird anxiety."
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.600]   Well, I mean, I don't think—I'm not a big—I'm bad at text messaging, let's put it that way.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.920]   Not really. You get back to me, like, right away.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.640]   I feel like.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:49.200]   You got lucky. Trust me, trust me, people know. It's like, if I have my phone around that I'm
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.560]   just doing a minute—like, I'll answer a text message, but if I'm in, like, a three-hour
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.000]   recording—like, I don't know what text messages are arriving right now. And I'll just declare—I
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.720]   declare text message bankruptcy basically after any extended period of doing something away from
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.200]   my phone. I'm just like, I can't—there's seven different things going on here, all with long
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.320]   threads. I mean, people just have learned that about me, right? Is, okay, you know, sometimes
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.560]   he's around and he'll answer. If he doesn't, he's probably, like, writing a recording and may not
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.360]   see this at all. And so I'm not gonna expect it. People rewire pretty quickly, I suppose.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.440]   And Jenny, by the way, just took, like, one of her podcasts off the—her calendar, you know,
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.520]   off of her plate as well, which is, like—she's in my book. I talk about her in the book.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.640]   That's low productivity, right? It's like, do I really need to do this? I mean, it's fine,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.760]   but what about the time I would get—okay, let me take this off my plate. Yeah,
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.520]   I love that way of thinking. It's like another quick break from my conversation with Jordan.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:44.480]   We'll talk about another sponsor that makes this show possible. That is our friends at Rhone.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.680]   Here's the thing. We know men's closets have been due for a radical reinvention,
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.960]   and Rhone stepped up to that challenge. Rhone's commuter collection is the most comfortable,
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:01.600]   breathable, and flexible set of products known to man. And here's why. They have elements for
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.600]   every occasion—comfortable pants, dress shirts, quarter zips, polos—so you never have to worry
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.720]   about having what you need to wear when you have the Rhone commuter collection. They have their
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:19.440]   four-way stretch fabric, which is very breathable and flexible. They have wrinkle release. As you
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.480]   wear it, the wrinkles go away. They have the gold fusion anti-odor technology. It's comfortable,
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.960]   it's lightweight, it breathes. Here's why I like the Rhone commuter collection. If I have a day
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.800]   where I am on it, I'm on the go, I'm doing interviews for my book, I'm lecturing, going
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.680]   from a lecture to sitting at a seminar panel and then moving across campus to go sit in another
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.560]   class, this is what I like to wear because it's lightweight, it breathes, it's not going to be
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.440]   wrinkled, it's going to look good, but I'm going to remain comfortable. So the commuter collection
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.760]   can get you through any workday and straight into whatever comes next. Head to rhone.com/cal
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.040]   and use the promo code CAL to save 20% off your entire order. That's 20% off your entire order
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:11.760]   when you head to rhone.com/cal and use the code CAL. It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.360]   I also want to talk about our friends at Mint Mobile. We're getting towards the end of the
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.480]   academic year. The summer is coming. It's a good time to step back and think about those things
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.400]   that have been cluttering your task list that you finally are going to have some breathing room to
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:32.480]   get done. But one of the things you should take a look at is how much you're paying for wireless
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:38.640]   service. Because here's the thing, Mint Mobile has phone plans that start at just $15 a month when
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.480]   you purchase a three month plan. When you compare that to what you're paying now for your cell phone
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.760]   service, you might be amazed. With Mint Mobile, you can get unlimited talk, text and data for just
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:12:01.280]   $15 a month. No more overpriced wireless plans with their jaw dropping monthly bills and unexpected
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:06.880]   extra overages and charges they like to throw in. Mint Mobile makes it simple. Premium wireless
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.640]   plans. We're talking high speed data, unlimited text and talk delivered on the nation's largest
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:19.040]   5G network for as low as $15 a month. You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.680]   You can bring along your phone number along with your existing contacts. Or if you need another
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.520]   phone, like we need a simple dumb phone for our house so that when my fifth grader is at home
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.000]   alone, he has a way of calling us if something goes wrong. So we just bought a simple phone
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.960]   off Amazon. Mint Mobile will allow us just to throw a quick $15 a month plan on there. No problem.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.160]   Really, if you just need to add another phone, add a dumb phone, there's no easier way to do it as
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.720]   well. So you should ditch the overpriced wireless and check out Mint Mobile. So to get this new
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.520]   customer offer and your new three month unlimited wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month, you have
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:05.840]   to go to MintMobile.com/deep. That's Mint, M-I-N-T, MintMobile.com/deep. Cut your wireless
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:14.880]   bill to 15 bucks a month at MintMobile.com/deep. $45 upfront payment required equivalent to $15
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.600]   a month new customers on first three month plan only speed slower above 40 gigabytes and unlimited
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.920]   plan additional taxes, fees and restrictions apply. See Mint Mobile for details. All right,
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.040]   let's get back to my conversation with Jordan. She's great at taking a few months off or whatever
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.400]   and just being like, this is my sacred time in Hawaii. Sorry. Or she'll like call friends like
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.760]   we're, you know, she's a friend of mine. I'm not asking her to do any work. So it's like, you know,
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.440]   hey, let's chat and catch up. But she she's what are you working on? Nothing. My tan, you know,
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.240]   great, good for you. But for me, it's like, oh, gosh, can can you do that? So she's been really
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.520]   good at sort of, I guess, an inspiration in many ways, you might say, because she's really good at
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.360]   not doing that stuff. And I won't say doing nothing because she gets a lot of stuff done.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:05.280]   But she's also one of the I had a problem many years ago where I separated from one business
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.080]   into another. And she's like, you need a she didn't call it a cool down period. But it was
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.680]   basically what you talk about, which is like a cool down. She's like, go to Hawaii for two months
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.160]   and just don't do anything. And that was too scary. I didn't take her advice. I kind of
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.200]   probably should have let me get your opinion on that. Because I I had an interesting argument
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.360]   about this with with Ryan holiday. So I want to get your opinion, right? What do you think
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:35.120]   would happen if you're with Amazon, right? That in terms of I'm not No, no, I'm on podcast one.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.480]   It's funny. I almost went to Amazon. That's okay. So let's say I talked about it. Let's say next
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.240]   time you negotiate your contract with podcast one, like what if you said, yeah, I podcast 10 months a
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.840]   year, right? And then like two months, I don't. So and it's like you go to like Hawaii or do
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:55.440]   whatever. So I brought this up on on Ryan show, because I'm really thinking about this is, you
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.840]   know, telling my my ad agency, I'm independent, but my ad agency books about a year in advance
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.960]   worth of my ads, right? And I was like, yeah, I'm thinking of telling them, let's book, you know,
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.400]   45 weeks, or whatever, 46 weeks. And I'm just going to take when I'm gone in the summer,
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.840]   like not worrying about like podcast or whatever, because I was doing the same sort of math,
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.320]   right? I was like, yeah, it's less money. But like, does it matter? Like, for me, I'm not,
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.480]   I'm not the pen, you know, it's all kind of funny money to me. Anyways, it changes each year. I'm
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.320]   like, whatever, why not? That would be great not to have to record. Ryan was very worried about
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.600]   this. Right. And this was in public. So I'm not talking about school. He's like, I don't know
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.440]   about this. I'm worried about this, because you're going to lose your audience. And people are not
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.880]   going to become used to listening to you anymore. And there's like a whole momentum thing. So okay,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.880]   you be the arbiter here, because I'm going to try to convince you to do the same if I do it.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.560]   Is that is that really scary? Or is it we're just telling ourselves the story? Yeah, I'm just
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:55.680]   nervous about not doing the work. With podcasts, though, tons of them go in seasons, right? Now,
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.720]   it used to not be the case. Tons of podcasts go in seasons. Now it'll be like 12 episodes or 24
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.680]   episodes of this TV goes in seasons, right, but they have to advertise the next season. What I
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:11.040]   what I would do if I were you in this particular situation is in certain apps, like Apple podcast
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.640]   will stop downloading, it'll be like, hey, this show hasn't been updated. Do you still want to
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.120]   listen and people have to kind of like re opt in. What you could do is take episodes like this one
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.720]   that I'm doing with you. And you could be like, alright, that was that was half decent. Why don't
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.240]   I save that? And I'll do that. I'll air that during my summer break. And I'll do it. I'll
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.960]   air the one I got did with Ryan during my summer break. And we'll I'll run two of those that are
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.400]   already done. You did like no work other than being the work you're doing right now sitting
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.640]   here suffering through this conversation with me. But you're doing no work to produce,
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.720]   write and edit the thing really, your team can get it done ahead of time. And then you have
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:50.160]   something to put in your feed. But it's not doesn't require you to then sit down and produce it. I
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.840]   mean, you could, of course, and you've already thought of this, you could also record episodes
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.680]   in advance, right? That's the other solution. And then you don't have to do any work during that
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.840]   time, right? That's sort of the ideal, but that requires you to do all the prep and all the
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:07.600]   production for those episodes. Yeah, so it could be a sort of a pseudo hiatus, right? It's like,
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.920]   yeah, in the summer season. It's it's like reruns, right? And then like the new stuff starts again.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:18.480]   And that's like enough to like keep you active in the podcast freeds and Apple doesn't unsubscribe
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.240]   you and people like, oh, this is a good one or button your downloads go down. In fact,
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:29.200]   you could even not sell ads on those or use programmatic advertising. Yeah, 100% man. Yeah.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:36.080]   You know, for me, I record ahead and I go on vacation. And nobody cares slash even notices
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.880]   for you. If you don't want to do that. Take take your take your rich role in your Ryan and your
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.480]   Jordan interview and throw them in every three weeks and people will be like, wow, those are
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.720]   really cool. I've never heard that side of Cal before. They're not going to be like, this guy's
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.640]   not doing any work unsubscribe. You know, they're gonna see you in hell, Newport. Right? Exactly.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.200]   Yeah. No one cares. There. I've put episodes where somebody interviews me and people are like,
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.680]   wow, I've never heard you interviewed before. That was my favorite episode of for the last year. And
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.440]   instead of it. Meanwhile, I put that in and I'm like, Oh, man, how many emails am I going to get
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.520]   that are like, are you okay? Are you sick? Why are you being lazy? Zero, zero of them came in.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.160]   I love it. Good. Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about that. But yeah, two months with nothing,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.760]   nothing. It's like, Oh, is he dead? You don't want to do that to your fan base.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.200]   There's so much in the book. And again, I'm going to cover a lot of this in the show,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.280]   in the show clothes. But there's a lot in the book about rituals and creativity of well known
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:34.640]   people, creatives finding certain places to do their work. Like I'm no Ian Fleming with a beach
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:42.400]   house in Aruba, or whatever it was. But I, I have certain places where I will sit down and answer
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.160]   certain kinds of like, I call it fan mail, which sounds so self important. Now that I say it out
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.160]   loud on your show, our on our show here, because we're doing a crossover. But it's like, it's fun
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.800]   to have a coffee and do that. And like, when that coffee is done, I'm kind of like, done with this
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:05.360]   particular project that I find helps me do certain kinds of work. If I'm reading, I like to go out
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.200]   and walk, it keeps the rest of my body busy gets rid of that anxious stuff. There's just so much in
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.800]   your book that is very practical. I don't want people to think that the whole book is like,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.080]   two guys complaining about how there are too many meetings, because that's not,
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.800]   that's not what you wrote about. Yeah, I mean, there's the there's the reduce part. And then
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.160]   there's the amplify part. Yeah, how do you produce better stuff, which is which is the glue
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:33.920]   for everything else, right? So this, this third principle obsess over quality. It's the glue for
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:39.200]   the other two, right? If you don't do that, if you don't care about like, how do I like really begin
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.880]   to care more about what I do best and like, push myself to do it better. If you don't do that,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.200]   you only just try to reduce workload. And you only try to work at a natural pace, that's probably not
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.120]   going to work. Right? Because it keeps you in this mindset of just like, I don't know, I don't like
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.800]   work, I want to do less of it. It's not very sustainable psychologically. But when you obsess
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.600]   over the quality of what you do, those ideas become inevitable and natural. It's like, yeah,
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.480]   I'm trying to do this thing better. Busyness is incompatible with me doing this better. So of
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.960]   course, I want to try to simplify things. And then that's why the flywheel starts getting pretty
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.080]   quick. As you start doing things that are valuable, better, you gain more autonomy and control over
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.800]   your workload, and it gets even easier to simplify it. And then that flywheel gets going. And that
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:24.800]   powers that really is what powers a substantial and sustainable shift to slow productivity,
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.360]   obsessing over quality. And that's where the rituals matter. Isolating what's important matters,
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.080]   working on your taste, caring about what you do. That's what ultimately is going to break you out
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:40.640]   of pseudoproductivity's grip and fuel you as you try to travel to a brand new configuration of work.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.280]   - Did you think about calling the book pseudoproductivity?
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.040]   - Yes, but- - But I didn't like that, right?
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.080]   - Well, the school of thought is you want to name this positive selling proposition, right? Like,
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.040]   what's the- - That makes sense.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:58.320]   - The worst, it did very well, but the worst performing, I'm still a New York Times bestseller,
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.840]   but the worst performing book of my last three or four was A World Without Email,
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.920]   because I was focusing on the negative, right? The title, deep work, deep work's the positive
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:12.640]   thing to do. Digital minimalism is the positive thing you want to do. Be so good they can't ignore
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.280]   you. True story about so good they can't ignore you, by the way, when I pitched that to my
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:24.320]   publisher, the title was Don't Follow Your Passion. And the publisher said, I will never publish a
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.120]   book with that title, and we left. I was at Random House, but we left and went to Hachette. But after
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.040]   we left, we swapped the name from Don't Follow Your Passion to Be So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.280]   to the positive. And then the book went to auction, and a lot of people wanted to buy it.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:46.240]   So yeah, focusing on the positive vision of where you want to get is better than pointing to the
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.760]   negative thing that you're trying to escape. - That makes a hell of a lot of sense. Yeah,
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.120]   'cause I noticed you keep using that phrase, and it's a great one, and I'm like, it's so catchy,
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.520]   but you're right, it is kind of like, no one wants to buy a book on pseudo-productivity. I
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.040]   would not buy that book either, now that you mention it. So they were probably onto something
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:07.680]   there. I love that you transitioned to obsessing over quality, because quality demands that you
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.800]   slow down in the first place, right? You can't do, I could do the show seven days a week if I
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   didn't need to read your book to prep, I didn't need to watch other interviews that you've done
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   to find out some of the stuff you're really passionate about talking about. I don't think
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.640]   the show would be nearly as good if I did seven a week, because at that point, you're kind of like,
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:31.360]   you know, to use the PC term, pooping 'em out, kind of, right? Like, back in the TV days,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.640]   when people cared about those talk shows that were on TV, I, RIP Larry King, but one of the
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.960]   things I asked him was like, how do you prepare for interviews, in part because it doesn't seem
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:47.040]   like he does a whole lot of that, and he said, yeah, I just use my natural curiosity, I often
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.560]   don't even know who's gonna be in studio that day, sometimes I read a printout of their bio in the
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.880]   car on the way to studio, and I thought, that worked for you, for a long time, because there
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:05.120]   was one other show on at the same time as yours, and they watched that, or they watched you, and
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.360]   that was kind of like, you threw your hands up in the air and it wasn't your problem, and that's a
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.400]   level of production that you can't get away with anymore, there's too much competition, if I'm just
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.240]   talking to you and I'm like, tell me what your book is, I haven't even looked at it, another
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:24.400]   podcaster who's like, I don't know, read the back in chapter one, is gonna crush me, and they should.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right, right? If you wanna actually do something good,
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:36.080]   you can't be busy, and this goes back to why, like, why do literary novelists do the fewest
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.000]   things as compared to every other type of author, because they're the most obsessed with the quality
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.400]   of what they do, because their whole professional career resides on their book being award caliber.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.400]   Like, if you're Jonathan Franzen, like, I can't just write a book, and be like, yeah,
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.400]   it's kind of interesting, it's like, this book had better be great, because that's my whole
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.640]   selling proposition, is that, like, I write great books, and so they're like, of course I can't do
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:04.240]   other stuff. Dave Eggers, very famously, goes to, like, a rental house with no internet, works on
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.080]   a laptop with no internet, and he just disappears and writes his novel, because the novels have to
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.720]   be good, and they obsess over, so, like, you see this, Chris Nolan, let's look at movies, right,
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:17.600]   Chris Nolan just won an Oscar, best director, best movie, all the, seven Oscars, but Chris Nolan
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:23.360]   doesn't even own a smartphone, right? He's like, I'm trying to win the best picture award, I can't
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.160]   do email, I can't, I don't wanna hear your pitch, and I don't wanna, 'cause people get this wrong,
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:32.000]   they get mad at me when I say that, they're like, well, but he has other people who take calls for
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.720]   him, and it's like, no, that's not the point. The point is, there's a lot of stuff that if you're a
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.520]   director, you could have your hands in, a lot of calls you could take because you wanna take 'em,
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.680]   let's strategize, let's, yeah, hey, let's do Dark Knight, The Ride at Universal Studios,
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.600]   and what are we doing over here? And what he's saying by saying, I don't wanna have a smartphone
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.640]   is, I just wanna work on the movie, because that's the difference between winning the Academy Award
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.960]   and making a billion dollars, and, like, oh, that was okay, right? So, like, the more, the more
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.280]   people move up that hierarchy of, like, the quality unambiguously matters, the less busy
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.320]   they become, but that same effect happens, like, with your solo entrepreneurship endeavor, with
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.520]   your podcast, with your job within a company, where you say, I'm gonna start specializing on
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.920]   this, and I wanna do this really well, I'm in sales, I can't do my job if I have to be on
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.080]   meetings all day, that becomes so clear and intolerable once you really focus on, I wanna do
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.920]   this thing well, that you find the courage and motivation to be like, we gotta completely
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.160]   reconfigure this, I'm not doing this, I'm not doing that, hold me accountable if you need to,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.960]   maybe, whatever you need to do, it becomes an imperative that if you're not obsessing about
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   quality, it just becomes a, wouldn't it be nice if I had less to do type of thing, which is not
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.440]   nearly as compelling. - It's not, and you write this in the book, you say something along the
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.800]   lines of, the market doesn't care about your desire to slow down, so, and you have to give
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:55.200]   something in return, so if you're not obsessing over quality, it's like, oh, I wanna do less
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.800]   stuff, I'm just too busy to focus, people are going, okay, but your work is, eh, it's all right,
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:05.280]   what do you mean you wanna do, cool, you wanna get a different job, to your earlier example,
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.720]   get a different job, but if you're suddenly, at my law firm, one of the highest paid guys,
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.200]   he was never in the office, and I was like, how did that happen, how come you don't, do you just
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.920]   work from home, and he's like, kinda, I mean, but that's not the point, he was bringing in business,
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.720]   so nobody was like, you know, you didn't hit your 2,000 billable hour requirement, they were like,
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:30.800]   here's a bonus check for $500,000, because you brought in Citibank, and the way he did that,
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:36.160]   was, he did, basically, no crappy little work, he was never in meetings, he didn't even show up to
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.200]   the office, and I was like, what are you doing, and he's like, ah, well, I'm limping because I
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:47.120]   have a jujitsu injury, because I was rolling with, I don't know, some junior partner over at Deutsche
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.600]   Bank, and then he was like, ah, but I've got this 30 mile cycling thing tomorrow with, I'm guessing
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:59.520]   another potential client, and so this guy was like, on cruises, at dinners, jujitsu, golf, biking,
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:06.960]   his biggest concern was resting his knee and hip, because he was pushing 40 or whatever years old,
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.160]   not, am I gonna hit my billable hourly requirement, so he had to basically satiate the market by
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.200]   doing work that was of a different or higher quality than everyone else, and so, go ahead.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.400]   I was just gonna say, people underestimate themselves, they don't realize that employers
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.560]   are desperate for good people. They imagine their employers basically are mustache twirling,
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.840]   and they're like, I kind of employ people, but I wish I could just fire them, no, they're desperate
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:42.080]   for good people that do stuff well. If you do something well that's valuable, that's the lottery,
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.840]   right, they struck oil, you have so much leverage you don't even know, right, they're like, I do not
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.720]   wanna lose this person, they're a rainmaker, they're bringing in business, they bring in the
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.640]   development dollars, no one organizes events better, whatever it is you do really well,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.520]   that is the most valuable thing if you're a manager or an employer, is someone who does
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.360]   something well, right, they're not looking for an excuse to fire you, they're terrified you're
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.560]   gonna leave. Once you start doing something well, you have all of this leverage, but it gets lost
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.400]   in the fog of pseudoproductivity, you're like, I don't know, isn't it bad if I say no, so I'm with
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:22.240]   you on that so much. - Man, I always love the message, do less but get better work done, and
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:27.280]   you bring that every time, and so, yeah, if you'll excuse me, I've got 600 emails in my inbox to
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.440]   ignore while I go out to lunch with my wife, but thank you so much for coming on the show, man,
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.520]   always appreciate it, and like I said, for people who are like, but wait, I have a lot more in the
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.120]   show closed, you talk about studying unrelated fields, which I really liked, no meeting Mondays,
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.880]   I've actually kind of got the opposite, meeting Mondays, if you want me on a day that's not
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.360]   Monday, better be damn important, and unless it's like this show, which is of course a different
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:54.880]   kind of work, there's a lot in your book as well on setting work boundaries, project timelines,
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:01.200]   long-term vision, types of workflows, so this is by no means an exhaustive interview of everything
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.880]   that's in the book, and I just, I always like to highlight that so people aren't like, don't need
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.800]   to buy that, already heard the podcast. - Yeah, well, Jordan, you're always one of my favorite
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.680]   conversations when I have something out, so I was excited, looking forward to a chance to chat
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.960]   about this one with you, I knew, we've known each other for a while, so I was like, yeah,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.160]   this is on Jordan's wavelength, but it's been a lot of fun talking to you about it.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.360]   - All right, so there we go, that was my conversation with Jordan Harbinger,
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:33.200]   I'll say, Jesse, it was a great conversation, on the scale of famous people he's had on the show,
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:39.600]   I don't think I've cracked the top five, I think he's had like LeBron James on the show,
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.880]   I think he's had some very famous people on this show, so I'm just sort of happy to be included,
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.840]   I've known Jordan for a long time, I think from my early days, probably a decade or more.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.920]   - Didn't you deny being on Tom Brady's roast though, you're pretty famous.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:58.160]   - Was I on, yeah, Tom Brady's roast, did you watch it?
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.840]   - It's on my list. - Okay.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:05.040]   - Mad Dog was talking a lot about it. - Yeah, yeah, okay, so when we do, yeah,
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.280]   next roast, Jordan Harbinger's show could have better roast guest on it probably than my show,
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.800]   my roast, if we had like a Cal Newport roast, it would be like me, Laura Vanderkam, Dave Epstein,
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:22.320]   and Brad Stolberg, like that's my crew on this show, he would have like LeBron James and Richard
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.320]   Branson or whatever, anyways, that was a fun conversation, so hopefully you enjoyed me being
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:32.640]   on the other side of the proverbial microphone there for a little bit. Okay, so by the time
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.640]   you're hearing this, I should be on my way back from England, so I will see you next week for
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:41.440]   a normal episode, I hope you like that, and until then, as always, stay deep.
