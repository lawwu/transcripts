[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.960]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.840]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.380]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.600]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.440]   as we encourage one another,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.560]   learn together and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.080]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.200]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.280]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.040]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.360]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.740]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.740]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.680]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.100]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.240]   Well, listeners, I'm super excited
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.540]   to welcome you to this episode.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.500]   I have a great guest for you
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   who is going to shed some light on homeschooling teenagers.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.220]   Woo-hoo, we all need light about that.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.300]   And about one of the specific projects
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.580]   that your challenge student either is going through
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.780]   or will be going through.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.700]   So Deb Switzer is here.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.860]   Deb, thank you so much for coming on
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.160]   to talk about the art grant proposal today.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.320]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.760]   I'm excited to talk about it.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.620]   - Well, one of the reasons, Deb,
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.960]   I'm excited for you to be here
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.120]   is that you have experience, okay?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.760]   You have experience with your own teenagers in your home.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.360]   You have experience with teenagers in your local community.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.720]   And I know that either they have rubbed off
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.120]   your rough edges through the years
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.960]   or you have just gained a lot of insight
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.360]   either from making all the mistakes
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.080]   or from doing everything right.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.240]   And you're gonna share both of those with us, right?
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   You better believe it.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.800]   - So guys, if you tuned in and you really want to hear
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.760]   all about the art grant proposal project
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.240]   because you don't know anything about it,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.600]   rest assured that we're gonna get there
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.560]   and we're gonna give you everything you need
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.280]   to go forward with joy.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.400]   Now that's a big promise,
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.000]   but we're gonna do our best.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.880]   But before we get there,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.760]   I want to talk to Deb just for a minute
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   about some general learning along with your teenager ideas.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.800]   Do you hear what I said?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.220]   Learning along with your teenager.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.080]   Unless you are vastly different from me and I suspect Deb,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.900]   you don't know everything yet.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.400]   - You know, surprisingly that is definitely the road
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.240]   that I am on.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.320]   I'm learning along the way.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.280]   - Well, and I'll be really honest.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.200]   Some of the things that I thought that I knew
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.920]   everything I needed to know about,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.520]   I really shored up my education as I taught my girls at home.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   Like I seriously redeemed huge pieces of my own education
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.560]   by teaching them.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.760]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.120]   And me too.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.080]   It is incredible to walk through challenge
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.200]   with your teenagers and find out one,
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720]   how much you don't know.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.600]   And again, also have the opportunity
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.200]   to be able to learn alongside your teenagers.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.400]   It opens up so many doors of opportunity for learning
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.320]   and understanding as you build relationship with your child
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.920]   and you read things together
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.200]   and you start to understand together.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.800]   And it's also the most humbling place
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.320]   because there are so many opportunities
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.160]   where you just have to look at your teenagers.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.840]   I don't know, I really don't know.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.960]   And we're just gonna have to dive in here together
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.880]   and go on this learning journey together.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360]   But I do think that that's probably
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   one of the most encouraging parts.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.840]   It's humbling, but it's also encouraging
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.160]   because your kids get to see that one, you want to learn
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.920]   and two, that you're always learning.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.640]   You're always on this journey.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.840]   There's never this place where you've arrived.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.640]   And so you get to do that with your kids.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.960]   It's such a beautiful bonding time
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   and a time of just growing together
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.720]   as mother and daughter or mother and son, it's beautiful.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.640]   - I love that.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   I know that when I had my, my girls are grown now,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.120]   but we went through all the way through high school with them
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.600]   so they marched through the entire challenge program
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.120]   with us nipping at their heels or leading them
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.280]   or in lockstep with them, depending on what subject
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.320]   and how familiar I already was.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   But I'll tell you, even in the subjects that I loved,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.080]   so I had an affinity for it
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   and/or I thought I got really good instruction
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.000]   either in high school or college,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   there were still assignments, books, projects
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.200]   that I had never done myself.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   And so there were times that even in subjects that I loved,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.080]   I felt like the blind leading the blind.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.920]   And so parents, I want you to take a deep breath.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   If you are stressed about the art grant proposal project,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.480]   I want you to take a deep breath.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.520]   Many of us never did anything like that.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.480]   In school.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.200]   And so we sort of think, I don't know what I'm doing
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.240]   and I'm supposed to be teaching this child.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.520]   You're gonna have to help me.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.320]   And so we're going to, we're going to.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.560]   But like I said, I wanna just ask a couple of questions
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   and help us explore maybe the challenges
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.040]   and the adventures of learning alongside our teenager.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.240]   You, Deb, you already gave us some of the good stuff.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.840]   It really builds camaraderie with your student
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.640]   for you to learn alongside of them.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   You are, I love what you said about, it is very humbling
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.040]   and it provides opportunities for our kids to see that,
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.800]   hey, mom, dad, they don't know all this stuff,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.960]   but they are committed to learning still.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.680]   This is a grownup who already has a college education
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   or already has had a job or already is in charge of our home
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.160]   and they seem pretty with it,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.680]   but they don't know how to do this
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.360]   and there's still things for them to learn.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.520]   And I think it's a beautiful thing for our children
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.240]   to grow up thinking that learning
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   is just what our family does together.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.240]   - Yes, and at that environment
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.720]   that we get to create as parents,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.960]   it just provides this place
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   for open communication and questions.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.440]   This whole classical model thing that we're doing
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.880]   is all about being able to ask questions
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.160]   and to discover along the way.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.720]   And the world does not give us answers,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.760]   just, hey, here's everything you have to do,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.360]   point A, point B, point C,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.800]   and let's go ahead and have you follow that.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   Instead, it's a journey of discovery
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.440]   for everything that we face.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.200]   And so this common place
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.560]   of being able to ask questions and discover together
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.720]   without having all of the answers right in front of you,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.640]   that's part of the growing process of becoming a teenager
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.840]   and becoming a lifelong learner
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.480]   is that we are able to find that place
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.640]   where we can ask the questions
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.280]   and go on that road of discovery.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.520]   Our grant is a great place
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.480]   where we get to discover and learn along the way
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.960]   and not have all the answers right in front of us.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.000]   - That is so great.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.160]   That is very encouraging.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.000]   Okay, so that's a great feather of encouragement.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.160]   I'm gonna stick in my cap
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.640]   and we're gonna come back to it.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.840]   What do you think, Deb?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.440]   'Cause I know you have been a challenge director
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.280]   for a number of years
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.800]   and you've seen the learning journey play out
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.240]   in countless families.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.240]   What have you seen as the biggest challenge for parents
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.120]   as their students move into the upper challenge years?
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.480]   I mean, how do we stay involved?
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.720]   And I used to tell parents
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.800]   that what you're doing as a homeschool mom and dad,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.040]   you're working your way out of a job.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.200]   And so the older our students get,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.680]   the less of a job we should still have.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.600]   But what do students still need from us?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.720]   - Yeah, there's no doubt that,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.400]   especially I could speak from my own experience
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.560]   as my children got older
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.680]   and were going through the challenge years,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.200]   that they were starting to learn things
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.040]   and experience things
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.360]   that I just couldn't keep up with anymore.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.200]   When you have a bunch of children at home,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.560]   you can only learn so much at a time.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.040]   That's why it's a lifelong journey.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.360]   And so as they were starting to get assignments
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.760]   that I didn't know or I didn't understand,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.920]   I started to have those homeschool stress panic attacks.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.360]   What do I do now?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.520]   And am I gonna ruin their lives?
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.960]   'Cause I don't know how to do this particular project.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   And so I think that having that time to just want,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.080]   well, one, giving yourself tons of grace
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.680]   to know it is gonna all be okay.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.080]   They're gonna work their way through that project
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.960]   and actually not being able to have everything right there
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.560]   is actually a beautiful growing experience for them,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   like I talked about before.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.440]   But it's also this sense of just carving out,
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.960]   like I have a, my way of dealing with it
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.000]   was I carved out a little bit of time every week
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   where I said, let's just touch base
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.640]   about the things that you're feeling uncomfortable with,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.800]   or let's spend a little bit of time
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.960]   talking about something that you've learned
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   that's been amazing this week.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.320]   And then let's also figure out
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.400]   what we need to dive into together
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.560]   and finding that special time that was just for them
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.840]   where they knew they had my undivided attention,
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.680]   that I wasn't gonna be over here and over there
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.080]   and working with their siblings.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.440]   But I said, you've got me for this half hour
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.400]   or this hour or whatever it might be,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.880]   and I'm fully focused on you.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.920]   That was a gift, not just to my kid,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.200]   but it was a gift to me too,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.160]   because it was an incredible time of just saying,
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.400]   I am completely focused on you right now.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.280]   And I loved those special moments.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.480]   I just, I talked with a mom recently who just said,
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.680]   I'm gonna take my daughter out once a month
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.520]   for a coffee date
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.560]   and just talk about the books that they're reading.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.520]   And even if I haven't read them,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.560]   we're just gonna talk about it
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.640]   because it's a special time
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.920]   to talk about what they're reading.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.760]   So those little things in the midst of it
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.800]   being a little bit scary,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.040]   I mean, like, I don't know what I'm doing,
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.720]   those times to just sit down and connect and say,
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.680]   well, we can work on it together.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   We can figure it out together.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   And I think that that's a blessing for the kids.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.880]   They love when we spend
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.480]   just that little bit of time with them
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.440]   and they know that they have our undivided attention.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.360]   - Undivided attention is something I think all of us value.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.800]   I know that when I can tell
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.320]   that somebody is really listening to me,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.120]   and when I feel like they have all the time in the world
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.800]   to spend with me doing whatever is most important to me,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.480]   I feel important.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.160]   And I feel supported by that person.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.040]   I feel loved by that person.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.720]   I feel heard.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.160]   And it really helped.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.880]   It gives me both freedom and the bravery
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.960]   to open up about things that are bothering me.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.680]   Things I'm not good at.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   I mean, I think sometimes as our students get older,
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.920]   they feel like they're supposed to be good
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.480]   at fill in the blank by now, right?
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.720]   And so when they have a moment of,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.600]   I don't quite have this, or I'm not sure about this,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   or I have hit a concept that is beyond me in the moment,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.000]   a lot of times they don't want to admit that to us.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And so I think, I love your idea of making sure
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.440]   that every week your child knows
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.360]   that they are going to have a period of time
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.640]   where they have your absolute undivided attention.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.240]   And if there's nothing wrong,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.440]   we'll talk about all the things that are right,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.200]   or we will study something together that we both love,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   but there is time set aside that they know
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.240]   they'll have your ear and your eye and your full attention.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.720]   And that is really important.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.360]   - Yeah, and it's, again, you know,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.600]   this whole homeschool thing ends up being
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.120]   so much about relationship.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.880]   And I mean, just consider how incredible it would be to,
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.000]   you know, on those weeks where things are going well
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.920]   or whatever it might be that you can say,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.720]   where did you find God in your studies this week?
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.560]   And we have this time and we can talk about that.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.600]   And, you know, embrace that and enjoy that moment
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.920]   and that wonder of,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.000]   oh, you saw God in the cells of biology
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.560]   or in the language of the choice that was, you know,
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.440]   there in the word and you saw it somewhere else
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.200]   and in a piece of literature
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.440]   and just being able to see God in all of it
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.040]   versus just like a Bible study or at church,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.400]   but God's in all of it.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.320]   And let's enjoy that together.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.280]   And let's see that even in the struggle,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.640]   God's in the struggle too.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.480]   So let's enjoy that as well.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.880]   - Yeah, and sometimes that meeting time every week
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.000]   is a prayer time.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.320]   Lord, we do not get this.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.880]   I'm not, I am missing the link.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.080]   My student is missing the link
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.400]   and I am not helping to excavate this problem.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.360]   I mean, I need help.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.760]   What are we gonna do?
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.320]   - I can't even begin to tell you how many times
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.240]   with my oldest, who's now, you know,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.840]   she just graduated and got married.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.880]   And, but our big joke is chemistry
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.720]   because I had to dive through chemistry with my daughter.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.000]   And I have hilarious pictures of her
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.520]   with her like hair over her head
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.320]   and just like hands in the head
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.360]   and just suffering through chemistry with me.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.840]   And now it's like our biggest point of laughter
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.400]   because we just laugh about how much I blew it,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.120]   but that we still struggled through it together.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.840]   And it's a point of like just enjoyment in our lives.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.320]   Now we just laugh about, you know,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   hey, you tried mom and you didn't do so great,
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.160]   but that's okay.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.640]   - It brings you together.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.000]   Yeah, I still have the twin whiteboards
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.360]   that me and my younger daughter used to do the,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.880]   and that, you know, that's where I discovered that,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.360]   oh, I don't have a chemistry problem.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.720]   I have an advanced math problem.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.320]   And so, and it's like, okay, we're gonna have to,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.520]   there's only one way.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.400]   We finally both came to the startling truth.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.600]   There's only one way to the other side
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.920]   of this chemistry module and it is to go through it.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.880]   And to do that, we're gonna have to press together.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.720]   But you're right.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.920]   It absolutely draws you together
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.440]   and it teaches you things about yourself.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.200]   It teaches you things about your child.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.480]   It teaches you things about the faithfulness of God
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.080]   that He leads you into hard things and through hard things.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.440]   And He teaches you when you least expect.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.320]   He taught us lessons that I was not expecting to learn
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.240]   in the midst of a different lesson.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.800]   So it was great.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.280]   - It's good to remember, I think in those moments
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.920]   when it's hard and you're ready to pull your hair out
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.400]   and say, why am I doing this?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.560]   To just reflect back and say, you know, God, I prayed
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.520]   and I really believe you told me to do this.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.960]   And it may not look today the way I thought
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.160]   it was going to look, but it doesn't change the fact
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.400]   that you told me to homeschool,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.160]   that you want this for our family
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.400]   and that I can just embrace that on the days
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.000]   where it looks so beautiful and perfect and Pinterest-y.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.360]   - That's awesome.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.200]   - The days where I wouldn't post in a million years.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.240]   - I need to say this.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.160]   I mean, I feel like I need to remind us,
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.240]   probably nobody listening to this had God say,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.880]   I intend for you to teach your child stoichiometry.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.000]   I intend for your child to know the fourth principal part
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.200]   of the Latin verb, amore.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.640]   No, I feel like what God called you to do
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.120]   is to raise your child in the nurture
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.920]   and admonition of the Lord,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   that you were called to teach your child
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.200]   to know God the Father,
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.680]   that you were called to help them along the way
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   to become a beautiful human
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.560]   who knows how to worship the Lord.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.880]   And so take a deep breath, parents.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.080]   We are doing what God called us to do
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.200]   when we are introducing our child to the Lord Jesus.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.320]   And we do that through all of these subjects
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.280]   and all of these projects and all of these problem sets
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.360]   and all of these books,
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.080]   and even through the art grant project.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.320]   So let's go back to that.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.200]   How can, Deb, how can parents
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.160]   move through assignments like this?
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.840]   What can parents do when they're called
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.680]   to shepherd a child through an assignment
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.800]   that they are wholly unfamiliar with?
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.360]   I mean, like I never had to write an art grant proposal
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.920]   in my life and never even attempted it
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.160]   until my girls were in challenge.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.520]   What are we as parents supposed to do with stuff like that?
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.240]   - Oh, it's the most important thing is to remember,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.320]   first of all, you're not alone, right?
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.240]   So, so many parents, including myself,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.800]   have never done anything like this.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.160]   And you sit there and you look at your computer
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.520]   or your guide and you go, I don't know what to do.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   So remember that you have this beautiful community with you.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.760]   You have a director who is gonna be able to provide you
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.160]   with some great information
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.440]   and provide your student with some great information.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.120]   And more than likely, or there's a good possibility
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.640]   that you've had a community
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.040]   that may have already gone through it
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.320]   with another challenge to community
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.440]   that's gone through it already.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.680]   And you can go and you can ask questions.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.840]   You can say, "Hey, did you do this last year?
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.560]   Can you show me what you did or what it was like?"
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.840]   Because those conversations are what helped to shape
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.240]   and form and put some more dimension
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.480]   into what is this project actually going to look like.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.560]   So I would say use those resources first and foremost,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.880]   ask questions in your community,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.440]   ask questions of your director.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.320]   Those, the conversations are what bring things to life
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.880]   much more than just reading the paragraph
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.240]   about the art grant and the guide.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.440]   Although that's an important paragraph to read.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   - Yeah, yes, yes.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.160]   - Those conversations really put the flesh on it.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.400]   There's also like, you have your guide
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.680]   which gives you a good overview of the project
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.120]   and what's going to be expected.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.560]   And there's a great tutorial overview
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.000]   on CC Connected about the art grant
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.480]   to give you a little bit of like, what is this project
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.200]   and how does it come together?
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.720]   So I really recommend that as well
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.120]   to just kind of get that overview,
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.080]   watch it with your student, watch it together.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.920]   - Yes, oh that's great.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.080]   - And then ask questions and answers together
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.120]   to kind of just help form it in your mind a little bit more.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.320]   - I love that.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.520]   Okay, so you have, all right.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.040]   All right, parents, you might have to stop
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.600]   and then wind back a little bit
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.000]   'cause Deb gave us a ton of good information
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.960]   and she mentioned several good resources.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.840]   The guide, obviously.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.080]   Okay, I say obviously.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.160]   All right, I have to just be really transparent.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.040]   I had been a challenge tutor myself for a while
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.120]   and one of my daughters made it to challenge one
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.240]   and she was working on her research paper
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.800]   and her dad was her challenge one director.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.880]   And when she turned in her paper,
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   he had some rather, I felt, critical feedback for her
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.800]   about some of the ancillary documents,
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   about her bibliography and about some title page
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.040]   that she was supposed to have.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.680]   And I was very affronted, okay, so why did you not?
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.440]   And he said, "It's in the guide.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.160]   "I'm expecting all of my students and parents
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.880]   "to have availed themselves of the guide."
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   And so parents, the guide is more than a syllabus
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.080]   that list when assignments are due.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.760]   Is that not true, Deb?
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.600]   - Absolutely, the guide is there
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.400]   to help put all of these different dimensions
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.080]   of these projects together.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.000]   And sometimes things are more vague
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.080]   and sometimes things are more specific, right?
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.560]   So you might have in that challenge one research paper,
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   there's something very specific
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.600]   that someone might be looking for.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   In the art grant, you might say,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.960]   "Well, give me the specifics.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.800]   "Give me like this point A, point B, point C."
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.920]   And the guide isn't gonna do that for you
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   on the challenge to our grant project
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.200]   and our type A personalities.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   If you're like me, you might start to--
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.080]   - I want a list.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.800]   - Yes, give me my checklist and give me all the things.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.680]   But this is a creative project.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:23.240]   And we don't want to squash creativity
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.520]   with a checklist that makes students feel
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.120]   that they have to line up in a certain way
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.520]   to be able to succeed.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.680]   We want them to explore ideas
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.760]   and to think through all the creative ideas
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.040]   that they might come up with.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   And how might I make a visual
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   and what kind of visual do I want?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.720]   But if you're on a certain timeline or checklist for that,
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.920]   it has the ability,
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.160]   especially with like such a variety of personalities
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.640]   and students to just box them in.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.640]   And we want students to really explore their creativity
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.120]   and all the different dimensions of the project.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.280]   So using the guide as your basic framework,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.720]   but then understand that there's a lot of freedom here
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.600]   because we want students to explore their creative juices
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.360]   when it comes to this project.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.080]   - Oh my gosh, that is so good.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.360]   Okay, so you heard what she said.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.720]   There are lots of places you can go to get help and support.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.240]   If you feel utterly out of your depth,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.280]   you're in the deep end and nobody gave you a kickboard,
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.320]   here's the deal.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.040]   The guide is always there
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.120]   and it will have some guidance for you
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.400]   and your student about the art grant project.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.200]   You also can talk to the tutor,
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.440]   the director of your child who will give some,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.440]   hopefully some good suggestions gleaned
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.720]   from past experience, her own, his own,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.880]   or other families' experiences.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   You can consult with other parents in the community.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:03.000]   Community mentor moms and mentor dads
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.920]   are the best resource ever.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.240]   Somebody who's got children a little older than yours
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.000]   who have walked through this, they have, listen, y'all,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.120]   they have already made all the mistakes
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.760]   that you're getting ready to make,
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.640]   and in love can say to you, and don't forget this,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.720]   and by all means, don't do that.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.160]   And this was some, and this is what I wish I had done, okay?
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.400]   So avail yourselves of those.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.680]   But then Deb, you mentioned something on CC Connected.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.560]   What, how can parents get into that
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.200]   and what might they find there to help them?
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.000]   - Sure, so there is, there are two resources
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.800]   out on CC Connected for the art grant.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.720]   So if you go into CC Connected
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.600]   and you just go into the Learning Center,
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.400]   you can type in art grant
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.880]   and it's gonna bring up two things.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.320]   The first thing it's going to bring up
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.480]   is a tutorial overview.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.800]   And so again, I think that is a great tutorial to watch
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   right alongside with your student,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.120]   take notes together, talk about it afterwards,
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.880]   start talking through ideas.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.640]   That is such a huge benefit.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.480]   Another portion of the art grant
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.160]   is as you come up with your idea,
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.840]   you're going to start to fill out
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.480]   what is called the art grant application.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.280]   And so that has all kinds of different questions
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.920]   that are there for the invention stage.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.560]   So it's a blank one
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.320]   so that you can have multiple copies of it.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.800]   So you know how you write things in
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.520]   and you're like, it's a hot mess.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.160]   I don't know what to do with this.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.520]   - I wish I hadn't done that.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.800]   - So you make a few copies of that
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.040]   'cause your ideas are gonna change over and over again.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.800]   And then you can fill that in
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.520]   and you can also type in it if you want to,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.720]   'cause it's a Word doc.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.320]   But that's available to you to be able to have
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.680]   multiple versions as you keep going
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.600]   through the invention process.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.920]   - Oh, that's so good.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.720]   So there are lots of resources, okay?
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.320]   So y'all all take a deep breath with me.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.840]   (Deb breathes deeply)
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.720]   There are resources, there are resources.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.400]   All right, now let's talk a little bit about the project.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.280]   Deb has whetted my appetite and yours too, I bet,
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.240]   by saying that this is a creative project,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.920]   a bit looser in structure than some of the projects
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.440]   our Challenge students will tackle
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.040]   during the Challenge years,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   mostly because we want students to feel the freedom
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.080]   to create and to explore,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.280]   and I dare say, to chase their interest a little bit.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.480]   So let's talk specifically about the Art Grant Project.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.360]   When does it happen?
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.560]   What challenge level is doing this?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.200]   What time of the year?
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.680]   All of that stuff.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.920]   - Sure, so the Art Grant Project happens in Challenge 2.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.640]   It's a great connection with the Western Cultural Studies
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.600]   that all the students are engaged in
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.920]   'cause they're studying the arts,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.640]   they're studying art and music.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.960]   So in the first semester, between week six and week 10,
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.600]   they're introduced to the Art Grant Project,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.640]   which starts on week six and ends on week 10.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.880]   And they get to basically think through,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.720]   the arts are a place where people ask for money
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.560]   all the time, right?
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.600]   And so they're going to think through an idea
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.960]   that they could take any passion that they have
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.440]   and how that might connect to the arts
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.400]   and any form of the arts.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.560]   And how would I pitch an idea, basically?
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.640]   The way I present it,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.280]   we're in the middle of this right now with my students,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.280]   I say, think about "Shark Tank," guys.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.480]   All these inventors are coming in with all these ideas
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.280]   and they're pitching their ideas
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.800]   and then they have to take questions.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.200]   It's an art version of the "Shark Tank."
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   And so then they basically just think through an idea,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.880]   how would it connect to the arts?
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.240]   They fill in the application, they create a visual.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.040]   So that's another portion of it
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.000]   is they create some form of visual to go with their speech.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.920]   It's a five minute memorized speech with their visual.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.960]   And then they're basically looking at
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.320]   what is a fake board of their own students
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.800]   or their own peers.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.040]   And they say, "Hey, here's my idea."
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.520]   And all their fellow students rank the ideas
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.680]   in terms of who do I think has the best idea
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.600]   for receiving a fake art grant.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.440]   - Right.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.320]   - And they have a ton of fun
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.960]   and they get to have a lot of creativity
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.480]   as they think through what kind of ideas they want to do.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.760]   - Oh, that is so cool.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.320]   All right, so I know you said
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.160]   that this happens in "Challenge 2"
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.720]   because it fits in really well
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   with the cultural studies of art and music that they do.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.640]   But more than that, why do we do this project?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.960]   What skills are our students practicing?
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   And how does this advance their grasp
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   of knowledge and understanding and wisdom?
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.000]   Why are we doing this?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.120]   - Yeah, so they are learning so many skills.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.560]   It's one of my favorite projects
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   'cause they just learned so many different integrated skills
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.880]   for life and all the different content
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.800]   that they've been learning in "Challenge."
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.600]   So obviously one, they get to express their creativity
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.000]   and think through their passions.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.240]   This whole project is a great precursor
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.400]   to the senior thesis in "Challenge 4"
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.640]   because they're going to find something
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.040]   that they're passionate about,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.560]   they're going to be able to present that.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.880]   And then they also have to take questions and answers
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.120]   about that project,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.280]   which is very similar to the senior thesis,
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.920]   but this is on a much smaller level.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.960]   So they're learning that skill
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.560]   of just being able to know their project so well
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.400]   that they can answer questions about it from the board
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.440]   or their colleagues or peers as they do that.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.160]   They also just get to practice either technical skills
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.120]   or artistic skills,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.600]   depending on how they want to do that visual.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.440]   So some students are going to do a PowerPoint presentation
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.840]   and they get to think through
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.920]   what actually makes a PowerPoint presentation?
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.800]   I feel like that's a great business world skill.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.280]   PowerPoints are done all the time.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.800]   And this is one of the times where we're like,
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.360]   technology is okay, you can do PowerPoint here.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.240]   And make something beautiful
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.560]   that enhances your presentation.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.600]   Some students are very artistic
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.400]   and they want to create a board
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.760]   or they might create their own mini sculpture
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.440]   of a version of a sculpture
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.560]   that they want to promote it in a park.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.920]   They get to work on those creative skills.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.560]   I also love that it reinforces
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.640]   the challenge one budgeting skills.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.480]   So all those economics discussions
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.000]   that they had in challenge one,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.720]   now they get to put some flesh on it
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.240]   as they create a budget for their project.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.080]   And what does that budget look like?
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.120]   And how would I enforce that budget
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.840]   and work within that budget?
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.200]   How much money do I actually need to do this project?
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.600]   Do I need more?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.240]   Do I need less than what I'm asking for?
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.200]   And so those are all questions
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.440]   that are real life applications, right?
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.640]   We all have to deal with money.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.080]   So that's definitely a skill that they're learning.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.680]   And those great memorized speeches,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.440]   they've been practicing those.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.320]   And this is just another avenue
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.720]   of practicing a memorized speech
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.240]   and those rhetorical skills
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.920]   to really just practice being persuasive.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.120]   Here's why my idea is worth you giving money to, right?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.760]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.280]   You know, I discovered when my girls were doing this
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.360]   and we're gonna talk about,
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.400]   one of the hardest things,
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.040]   getting started and coming up with your idea.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.680]   We're gonna talk about that in a minute.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.440]   But I did notice that after we got started,
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.120]   after we got in the groove,
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.520]   these skills that you just mentioned
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.880]   really were sharpened in my children
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.960]   as they went through the steps and stages of this project.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.200]   I watched them learn to manage their time
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.680]   because, you know, like you said,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.360]   this happens sometime between week six and 10.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.200]   Well, that's four weeks, you know,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.440]   that's four weeks of time in there.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.800]   And if you lollygag around until week nine,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.600]   then that is not a good management of your time.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.360]   And that bites you and you learn quickly.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.640]   That was a bad idea.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.720]   I hope I never do that again.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.320]   And so I saw that my girls quickly began
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.600]   to manage their time better
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   when some things took longer than they had anticipated.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.000]   Or they had to start over
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.960]   because they had not considered all the possibilities
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.840]   of things that might happen to either derail
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.480]   or shift the focus of their projects.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.080]   Not everything works out like you think it will.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.640]   And when you get in the middle of it,
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.680]   you realize you have now gained valuable insights
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.880]   that you wish you had known
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.000]   at the beginning of this project.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.840]   - Right, and I think that-
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.440]   - That's a great thing to learn.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.000]   - It's a blessing to learn.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.480]   So, you know, I think as parents,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.240]   we can start to just be upset with our teenagers saying,
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.720]   "Oh, you waited till the last minute,"
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.680]   or "Why are you changing your idea?"
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.320]   Or, you know, but this is part of the process, right?
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Is that they are becoming a stronger decision-making adult
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.680]   as they go through this process
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.360]   and have to make choices
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.160]   and reap the consequences of those.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.560]   So it's not a bad thing
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.000]   if your child is halfway through their project
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   and says, "This idea is terrible.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.480]   It's not gonna work."
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.240]   And we think, oh, you know,
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.400]   of course we would prefer that that didn't happen.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.040]   It causes stress on mom too.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.880]   - Yes, it does.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   - You know, I'm laughing 'cause I've had this conversation.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.320]   I'm like, "Why are you changing your project right now?
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.680]   What?"
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.240]   'Cause now I have to shift and adjust my whole life
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.080]   for this.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.480]   - Right, exactly.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   Oh.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.320]   - But I think it's, in a way,
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.600]   it's their learning as they go,
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.640]   the consequences of like,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.080]   "Did I really go through that invention process well?
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.720]   Did I really think it through?
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.080]   Did I really spend time on that arrangement canon?"
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.720]   And, you know, "Consider the way I have to present it
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.520]   or is it gonna make me backtrack?"
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.240]   And so each of these canons is a learning process.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.800]   And so the Art Grant gives them an opportunity
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.760]   to learn each canon of rhetoric.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.400]   It involves all five.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.880]   And they are able to see,
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.360]   "Hey, maybe I'm strong here,
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.520]   but my arrangement canon needs some serious help."
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.640]   And projects like these help you learn yourself
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.120]   and where your strengths and your weaknesses are
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.120]   so that you can know where I need,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.760]   I'm gonna need to account for more time on this part.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.600]   - Yes.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.480]   - You know, because it's not my strength.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.520]   And instead of just brushing through it
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.760]   and then finding out that it's a disaster later,
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.800]   I'm going to spend a little bit more time
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.480]   or ask for some more help
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.440]   when it comes to inventing or arranging or elocuting
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.800]   or I need you to drill me a little bit more
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.040]   for the memorizing.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.600]   Whatever it might be,
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.000]   these are the projects that help you learn
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.720]   where your strengths and your weaknesses are.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.560]   And it's good.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.640]   It's a good thing.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.760]   - And it helps you own the whole process,
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.120]   not just the finish, but the whole process.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.640]   And you know what?
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.920]   I feel compelled to say,
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.040]   "Parents, let your child,
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.480]   let your student learn the hard lesson."
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.240]   And sometimes they have to learn it the hard way.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.120]   Sometimes teenagers think,
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.160]   "I got this, I got this, I got this."
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.880]   And then they don't have it and it needs to buy.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.080]   I feel like my daughter and I both
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.600]   very viscerally remember her art grant project
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.840]   because we were, like all of our families do,
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.440]   getting all our stuff together night before.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.920]   Mom's a challenge director.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.440]   She's got her art grant.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.480]   Her sister has all her challenge A stuff.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.400]   We're getting everything together.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.440]   And I said, "Get all your stuff."
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.200]   And I drove a carpool of other kids
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.920]   and I was very committed to getting there early
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.720]   so I could meet with parents who had issues or questions.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.920]   And so we, "Hurry, hurry, hurry, get in the car.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.960]   Have you got all your stuff?"
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.400]   "Yes, I have everything."
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.880]   "Okay, we're getting ready to leave."
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.800]   "I'm ready."
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.000]   And we got halfway and she said, "Oh, we have to go back."
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.720]   I said, "Excuse me?"
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.560]   She said, "We have to go back."
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.840]   I left my poster.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.160]   I left my visual aid and today is presentation.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.440]   And I just kept driving.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.520]   And she said, "I left my thing.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.840]   We have to go back."
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.760]   And I said, "You know, you need for us to go back.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.120]   I can't spare the time to go back."
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.920]   And she said, "Well, then I have to use your phone
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.040]   'cause I need to call Daddy.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.880]   I need to get."
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.200]   And I said, "Okay, you can call.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.080]   I don't think Daddy will do it.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.000]   And if Daddy asked me if he should,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.080]   I'm gonna tell him no."
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.120]   And she was so mad at me.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.640]   And in fact, she had to give her art grant project
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.600]   without her visual aid,
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.520]   which made it, you know, for the "Shark Tank" judges
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.240]   much less effective than it would have been.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.080]   - Right.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.320]   - And I think that she,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.120]   it took a lot of weeks for her to quote, unquote,
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.880]   "Forgive me for that."
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   But what I noticed is that it was a very valuable lesson
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.920]   because she became much more an advocate
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.960]   of getting her stuff together.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.400]   And she has grown into a grown-up.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.600]   - Yeah.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.440]   - Makes her list and checks it twice.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.320]   So it was a hard lesson.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.920]   It was a hard lesson that it paid dividends, okay?
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.640]   I love that you laid out for us
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.200]   all through this parts of the project
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.920]   from settling on an idea
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.160]   to doing some research
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.400]   that would help you design a project
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.320]   and set a budget, you know,
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   arrange how you would structure your proposal,
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.960]   but then also arrange how you would tell about it.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.720]   And then creating your visual aid
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.440]   and actually delineating
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.800]   and practicing your presentation.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.400]   I think one of the hardest things is to realize
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.720]   after you have put, you know,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.960]   three or four or five weeks even into a project
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.400]   is realizing that everybody doesn't know
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.640]   what you know about it.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.120]   And so you have to set the stage
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   so that people can understand the passion that you feel
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.400]   and maybe buy into it.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:21.400]   How much freedom do parents and students have
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.920]   to design a project that their students could feel
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.680]   that degree of passion about?
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.120]   How are they supposed to pick a topic?
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.560]   What would you say?
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.200]   - Yeah, the process,
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.120]   I think that's the hardest part of the Art Grant Project
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.480]   is choosing what on earth am I,
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.800]   what is this idea that I am going to pitch, right?
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.640]   - Yes.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.080]   - And students often just sit there and look at you
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   and they say, I have no idea what to do.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.640]   Give me an idea.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.160]   My kids looked at me at home and said,
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.560]   please just give me an idea.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.720]   - Just tell me what to do.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.880]   - And so it's kind of working your way backwards
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.200]   and saying, well, let's ask two,
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.280]   I had my kids answer two questions.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   I was like, what are you passionate about?
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.960]   What do you love?
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.800]   Let's figure out what you're passionate about
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.880]   and what you love.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.760]   And then the second question after we would talk about that
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.160]   was we would say, okay,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.680]   now how might we be able to incorporate that with the arts
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.800]   if it's not already an arts oriented thing?
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.360]   And then moved it one step further and said,
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.080]   how can that bless a community?
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.640]   So looking at three stages of it,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.240]   what's your passion?
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.440]   How might that fit in with the arts somehow?
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.200]   And how might it bless a community?
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.800]   Because really when you're asking for the Art Grant,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.040]   it doesn't have to be a service project,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.920]   but quite often it's in some way blessing a community
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   'cause people are gonna be giving money to it, right?
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   And so there's gotta be an audience
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.280]   that is going to enjoy it or participate in it.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.480]   And so I know for my,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.840]   I'll just speak for my own two children,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.000]   like my daughter and my son are very different.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.960]   So my daughter loved music.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.800]   And so she was already there in term of the Arts Grant
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.200]   'cause she's like, I'm a music person.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.160]   I love the arts.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.200]   This is great.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.040]   And so she was thinking through
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.360]   about how to give lessons to inner city kids
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.800]   and give classical music lessons to them.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.960]   And then my son though, he's a sports guy, right?
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.040]   And he's like, I don't know, I don't sing, I don't dance.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.800]   I, you know, he's like, I play sports.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.480]   And so, but he started to think about a missions trip
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.560]   that he was on and how all the kids played sports.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.400]   And he was like, well,
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.360]   what if we were able to design clothes, you know,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.120]   like little soccer uniforms for these kids overseas
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.200]   with like a clothing design
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.480]   that would help this missions organization.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.440]   So he went from his passion of sports
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.880]   to thinking about how that could go with the arts
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   and then moved it into how it could bless a community
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.040]   over in Botswana, Africa.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.480]   And so that was his process.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.120]   And lots of kids have things that they're passionate about,
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.920]   you know, I think I posted something in the form about,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.520]   you know, if you're a Save the Turtles person, right?
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.000]   And you can create a mural on a, you know,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.400]   in a city block or a statue of some sort
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.000]   that is going to try to bring awareness
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.560]   to that passion of yours.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.840]   And so it's trying to meld those three things together,
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.760]   your passion, how it goes with the arts,
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.680]   and then how it blesses a community.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.520]   Those three things are going to help you form
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.040]   that creative idea that you're looking for.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.040]   - Oh man, Deb, that is absolutely perfect, okay?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.880]   Because you have given us the big picture
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.160]   of why this project is so good
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.920]   and what skills our students are gonna sharpen
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.640]   that are gonna be useful to them for the rest of their lives
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   but also how you've given us some really practical ways
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.520]   of narrowing down the hardest part of the whole project,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.320]   deciding what to do.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.240]   I think that you hit the perfect formula.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.800]   What do you love?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.000]   What are you passionate about?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.880]   How is that related?
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.480]   How might that be related to the art?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   And what could you do with that to bless a community?
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.080]   How could this be a service
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   that others would be motivated to support with giving?
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.000]   That is just really good.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And what a beautiful outlet for our students
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   to think about the way the Lord has placed giftings
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.320]   and yearnings in their own hearts,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.960]   and then what they could do with the passion God
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.400]   has given them to serve the world
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.440]   in which he has placed them.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.400]   - And I think people might even,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.520]   I love the testimonies that come out
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.880]   of the Art Grant Project
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.640]   because it brings in a level of awareness
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.560]   for the student that they didn't know before
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.960]   where they're like, oh, I could actually do something
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.480]   that could serve the community,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.360]   or I can have an idea, whether it's arts-based or not,
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.640]   that can actually be a blessing to others.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.480]   And so I had a student a couple of years ago,
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.280]   and her art grant proposal was about music again,
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.680]   and working with music stores
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   to get donations of instruments to impoverished families.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.400]   And she did a great job,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.680]   but the best part of the art grant
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.200]   was after the whole project was over,
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.840]   she actually went to a music store and pitched her idea
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.680]   and said, hey, there's this family that has eight kids,
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.960]   and they don't have the money for lessons,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.120]   and I'd like to give them lessons for free,
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.400]   but they need to be able to have the cello
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.920]   to be able to rent.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.880]   And the music company just listened to her idea
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.000]   and said, sure.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.120]   And so they rented these cellos for free to this family
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.280]   so that my student could give free music lessons
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.120]   to this family.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.840]   And it was such a beautiful application
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.960]   of living out these ideas.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.600]   You never know what's gonna come out of this idea
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.640]   of breaking out of our normal academic mindset
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.960]   and saying, I wanna put hands-on application
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.600]   to the study of the arts and my passions
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.720]   and all these things and see it lived out.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.520]   It's just, it's a beautiful thing to watch.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.480]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.640]   That's the most inspiring thing,
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.520]   that the testimony is from our students
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.520]   is that they are able to make a difference in the world.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:09.880]   Can you imagine being more empowered as a teenager
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.800]   than to see that you have learned
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.480]   to make a lasting impact on the world?
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.320]   That's the coolest thing.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.720]   I think that would be my favorite part
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.080]   of shepherding a class full of students
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.480]   through the Art Grant Project.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   Deb, thank you so much for making this seem like
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.800]   not a scary thing, but a very exciting
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.080]   and empowering assignment for our students.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.440]   Thank you.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.280]   - Thank you.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.640]   - I just really appreciate it.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.720]   And parents, I suspect that you now have
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:48.720]   a brand new appreciation for this process
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.640]   and for this project with your student.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.280]   I suspect that we're going to have
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.560]   some stellar Art Grant Proposal Projects.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.200]   And I would love to let you know of a way
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.800]   that you could celebrate your student,
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.200]   that you could celebrate your community,
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.560]   that we could all celebrate together
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.680]   at the wonderful ways that our students
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.200]   are impacting their communities.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   I want to tell you about something
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.760]   called Honorable Mention.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.480]   It is a process for celebrating together.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.880]   If your community or your student has done
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.040]   or is doing something noteworthy,
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.640]   I want you to know that we're collecting those stories,
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.680]   those accomplishments, those events.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.880]   We want to celebrate and share
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.080]   the excitement of homeschooling.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   So we want you to provide as much information,
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   as many details as possible to completely tell your story.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.640]   And then share your story,
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.400]   whether it's of the Art Grant Proposal or something else,
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   share your story at classicalconversations.com/celebrate-together.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:09.240]   Okay, so it's all one word.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.240]   Here we go again, classicalconversations.com/celebrate-together.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.120]   That's where you can share your stories
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   and we will celebrate our successes and our growth together.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.800]   Again, Deb, thank you so much for being an inspiration
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.600]   to all of us who are tackling things
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.520]   we never thought we could.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.520]   - Oh, it was great to be here.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.720]   Thanks so much, Lisa.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.480]   - All right, families, we will see you guys again
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.880]   next time on "Honorable Mention."
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.920]   We'll see you guys again next week.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.760]   Bye-bye.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.400]   (gentle music)
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.460]   you
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:49:01.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
