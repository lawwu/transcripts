[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440]   I am your host.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.640]   And today, I aim to encourage you by enhancing your appreciation of how rich and peaceful
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.760]   your life is, even today, even on today.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.340]   Notice I'm saying today, which is November 6, 2018.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.000]   It is an election day in the United States of America, and a great many of my fellow
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.680]   U.S. American citizens are feeling significant angst today over the elections.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.480]   Now, here's what's unfortunate for you.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:22.000]   There's a good chance that you are going to be disappointed in the wake of today's elections.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I repeat, there is a very, very strong probability that you are going to be disappointed in the
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.960]   wake of today's elections.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.320]   Two main reasons why I say that.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.380]   Way number one that you'll be disappointed is if your preferred party, candidate, issue,
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.000]   if your preferred positions or people or platforms lose in today's elections, then of course
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.840]   you will feel that keen sense of disappointment.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.240]   And there's a good chance that you will experience that deep emotional just pain that comes from
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.520]   the loss of an election.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.040]   It's very hard if you have invested your emotional energy into certain candidates or positions,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.520]   if you've tried hard to lobby your friends and neighbors, you've battled these things
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.040]   out in the public social media space, and you've desperately tried to change people's
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.000]   hearts and minds to agree with you, and then you find that, well, it didn't actually work.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.680]   That's a strong reason for disappointment.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   And there's a good chance that you'll be experiencing that tonight as the election returns roll
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   in.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.200]   Now, if on the other hand, you don't experience disappointment tonight, if tonight you get
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   to bask in the victory of winning or the emotions of winning, the emotion of victory, if you
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.000]   get to enjoy that tonight, you'll face two problems in the next weeks and months.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.520]   Problem number one is your victory tonight is only one small step in a long battle.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.600]   It's only one small battle in a long war.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.640]   And problem number two is your candidate who gets elected won't actually do anything.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.400]   Your position that you're voting for won't actually change anything.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.880]   Now, whether that's because your candidate was somehow, well, let's just use the right
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.000]   word lying.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.280]   They said a lot of nice things that they wanted you to believe, but they didn't actually believe
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   those things themselves.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.140]   They just said those things to get elected.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.440]   Or whether it's because your candidate is well-meaning and well-intentioned and just
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.080]   quickly overwhelmed by the ongoing bureaucratic nature of government, by the fact that one
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   individual candidate can really do very little, you'll face the disappointment and the frustration
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.400]   of seeing that candidate become quickly ineffective.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.520]   So one way or the other, you're probably going to be experiencing some significant feelings
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.360]   of frustration and disappointment tonight and in the coming weeks and months in the
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.840]   wake of an election here in the United States.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.080]   What I want to do, however, is help you to gain a different perspective because so much
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   of life can be enjoyed if you have a different perspective.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.800]   Two people face the same circumstances and they experience the emotions of those circumstances
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.760]   very differently.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.560]   Just speaking with some common financial examples, one person cuts off their cable TV and celebrates
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.000]   it as a way to be released from the grip of the propaganda machine and a way to regain
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.960]   some peace back into their life and a chance to read some more books.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.200]   Another person cuts off their cable because they're out of money and sees it as the ultimate
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.820]   expression of their poverty and it's deeply frustrating to them.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.040]   One person moves into a van down by the river and sees it as an ultimate expression of a
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.760]   lifestyle choice that fills their values of simplicity and frugality and minimalism and
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   an opportunity to commune with nature and to live a lifestyle of adventure.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.600]   Another person is forced out of their house and into a van down by the river and finds
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.440]   it to be the most humiliating thing that ever happens to them.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.600]   And we could go on and on.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   You could see same situation, different perspective.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.000]   So often if you gain a different perspective on something that's happening around you,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.320]   you can appreciate it in a different sense.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.760]   That's not to minimize what actually happens, but it is to say that part of a good mental
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.520]   health or part of the ability to maintain good mental health is just simply being able
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.040]   to pull back from the situation that's near you and appreciate things that happen around
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   you.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.240]   So today I want to bring you a story that I've often wanted to talk about, but I haven't
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.920]   for quite a long time because first it's fairly personal.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.680]   Two, I've wanted to see all of the details verified because unlike many types of stories,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.960]   there was no way to verify this except through personal contact.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.880]   There was no news vetting that could accomplish the task.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.360]   There was no journalistic investigation into various reports and censoring the truth from
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   various perspectives.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.800]   There was only personal confirmation that could happen.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.560]   And that has only happened fairly recently.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.120]   But I thought today on election day in the United States, it would be a useful point
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:38.480]   of orientation for you to appreciate the rich and peaceful life that you and I enjoy.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.280]   Today's story comes from the country of Kenya.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.560]   I'm going to be quite circumspect with the details of the towns and cities in Kenya.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.520]   I'm also being circumspect with the names of the people involved, but the facts are
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.920]   true and it's a situation that I've been involved in for years.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.720]   Going back a number of years, over the years, my family and the church that we're a part
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.040]   of, we've had contact with a number of different people in Kenya.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.000]   And one man that we've come to have contact with is a man named Jacob.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.680]   This man named Jacob is a really incredible man, a man of character and integrity, just
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.640]   a testament to who he's a man of character and integrity.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.000]   I can't say enough good things about him.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.560]   Jacob has his own interesting story and it's interesting, especially as it relates to finance,
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.800]   to see the twists and turns of his life and to compare them with the financial planning
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.400]   that most of us do in our own life.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.960]   Going back a number of years, Jacob and his wife had young children and a small family
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.560]   and they were living in a part of the country that started to turn against them because
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.240]   Jacob and his wife were from the wrong ethnic tribe in that part of Kenya.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.440]   And so Jacob and his wife sought to move for the safety and peace of their own family,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.940]   they sought to move from that part of the country to another part of the country.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.720]   They were facing significant risks of violence towards them and their family.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.200]   They actually did flee in basically in what was the middle of the night, flee across the
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.600]   countryside to escape the risk of their life and managed to make it from one part of the
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.400]   country to another part of the country where their tribal ethnicity would not cause them
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.040]   so many problems.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.520]   Jacob and his wife had developed their own farm prior to their having to flee.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.480]   And in fleeing from that farm, they've ran the risk of having it all left behind.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.040]   Now thankfully, after they were gone, they were able to negotiate the sale of their previous
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.200]   farm and they were able to negotiate the lease, hopefully leading to a purchase of a newer
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.400]   farm.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.800]   This newer farm was a great opportunity that landed in their lap because it was unlike
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.760]   many of the structures and the farms in the area.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:09:00.080]   It had been built by a wealthy man who had basically built it up as his retirement project
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.640]   and yet through a variety of miraculous circumstances.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.840]   And when I use the word miraculous, I don't use it lightly.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.760]   I use it in its sincere and true sense.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.480]   Through a variety of miraculous circumstances, Jacob and his wife came to be the tenants
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.520]   and the owners ultimately of this farm.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.240]   This farm was unique because it had large buildings, well-built structures, unlike most
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.840]   of the local structures, which are basically mud huts.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:35.320]   This farm had structures made out of stone and it was really a well-done farm.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.480]   Now that was the first of many unique steps in their own financial journey.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.840]   Again, consider fleeing from where you live to another part of the country because of
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.160]   the risk of you and your family basically being lynched in the middle of the night because
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160]   you're from the wrong ethnic tribe.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.280]   So fast forward a while, Jacob and his wife, their children continue to grow.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.960]   And Jacob is a man who is very active in Christian ministry there in that part of Kenya, very
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.560]   active in the community seeking to network and encourage other Christian churches that
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.120]   are nearby.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.760]   One day, he gets word of a flood that had happened in a nearby town.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.380]   And what happened was during the middle of a weekday when the children were away at school,
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:28.320]   there was a flash flood that arose and basically swept away this small village in Kenya and
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.600]   destroyed the town and killed many dozens.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.480]   And I think it would be, I don't think I'm stretching any numbers to say hundreds of
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   local residents.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   I don't know the exact number.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.400]   This is a part of the world in which getting news verification, journalistic verification
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.640]   is almost impossible.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.200]   So almost impossible to sit in the United States and find out about these things in
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.720]   remote regions of the world.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.800]   But many, many dozens of people were killed, including several dozen members of a local
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.480]   church that Jacob had had interaction with.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:11.120]   So as Jacob is there, there are about a dozen orphans that he had known prior to the flood
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.640]   and they were newly orphaned that day.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.440]   Again, the children were away at school in a higher part of the country, not down in
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.420]   the canyon where the flash flood was, and their parents were killed in the flash flood.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.520]   So of course, them knowing Jacob and him knowing them, he took them home to care for them for
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.400]   a few days while they figured out what the plan would be.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.840]   Now as time went on, ultimately he tried to work with the government and tried to understand
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.760]   how these orphans could be helped.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.880]   But Kenya has a very unique challenge with orphans and there's basically no infrastructure,
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   no governmental infrastructure for the support of orphans.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.600]   And so at the end of the day, after going back and forth with the governmental authorities
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.440]   for a time, he was basically told either you care for them or put them out on the street.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   There's no other option.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   And putting orphan children out on the street is relatively common.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.240]   And the orphans are expected to either die or make their way by begging or stealing or
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.720]   some way of trying to make their way.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.280]   Well, he and his wife couldn't put them out on the street and they decided, well, we'll
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.480]   deal with this together.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.400]   So live or die, we'll all be in this together.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:23.480]   And so he and his wife adopted the 12 orphans, bringing their family size up, obviously rather
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   significantly.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   I don't remember the exact number.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.800]   I think they had four biological children at the time, brought them to 16 children,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.040]   something like that.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:39.080]   Now you and I, if we wanted to, could actually very easily adjust our budgets to care for
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:47.000]   an additional 12 children, especially if we adjusted our use of the word care to the practical
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.520]   matters of life.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.680]   You and I probably couldn't absorb an additional 12 children into our lives if we committed
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.240]   to sending them to dance lessons and football camps.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:04.520]   And if we committed to all of the finest organic food and if we committed to going out to eat
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.100]   once a week, et cetera, et cetera, the things that are fairly common for our lifestyles.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.840]   But if you and I brought these children into our lives and we committed to providing enough
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.800]   calories in order for us to stay alive, you and I could fairly easily bring 12 children
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.120]   into our lives and care for them.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   Not so easy if you are a subsistence farmer in a very poor country, but through a variety
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:36.000]   of again, miraculous circumstances over the years, Jacob and his family have been provided
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   for.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.840]   And back to the provision of that particular farm, that farm has proved to be for him and
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.920]   his family a significant blessing.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:51.000]   Again, I remind you, all of this is, everything I'm telling you is true and is not in any
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.360]   way embellished or exaggerated.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.880]   This farm proved to be a blessing because although it had been much more than Jacob
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:05.520]   and his wife had needed when it was just them and their small children, it was exactly what
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.240]   they needed when their family was significantly enlarged.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:17.000]   In addition to the orphan children, they also brought into their family several widows of
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.080]   men who had been killed in that flash flood and those widows who'd been, I'll pass
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.320]   some of the circumstances, there's heart-wrenching circumstances of what those widows had faced,
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.120]   but they had children as well.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.000]   And so their family was actually larger than just that.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.540]   And so the provision of this large farm and the buildings turned out to be a great blessing
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.120]   for them.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.060]   Now over the years, it has not been easy for them.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.360]   Even though they had infrastructure, they still face the constant challenges of drought
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.640]   and famine and food prices that change in an incredible way.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:58.520]   One anecdote, last year there was a time of famine and the food prices in the local area
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.680]   in Kenya multiplied by five overnight.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.800]   I talked a moment ago about the fact that you and I, as relatively affluent people,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:15.080]   we could absorb the expenses for 12 children into our families if we wanted to.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.040]   We would have to reprioritize many other areas of our expenditures, but we could absorb them
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.860]   in.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.900]   But now consider absorbing them in when the cost of food increases by 5X due to famine
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.240]   and due to political conditions.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:37.260]   That one really sobered me up when I first heard that a couple of years ago when it was
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.260]   in the midst of it.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.780]   Now consider a 5X increase in your food budget.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:47.420]   That was what these particular people that we have contact with in Kenya faced.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.260]   Five times increase in your food budget.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.260]   It staggered me.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:59.860]   Well fast forward, last year in Kenya there was a significant amount of political turmoil.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.940]   And all through that, since that political turmoil, all through we've had contact with
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.660]   it, but it wasn't until recently that we could get true confirmation where my dad recently
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.500]   went to Kenya and spent a couple of months there in Kenya traveling around, ministering
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.260]   among some of the local contacts that we have there.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.860]   So this is a firsthand report specifically from my own father who was able to see and
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.220]   verify these details that we had had a lot of correspondence on over the last couple
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.220]   of years.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.580]   And I want to read to you his summary of the situation.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.820]   And this was never intended.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.660]   He didn't ever intend this as a kind of a public document.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:40.060]   This was just a private summary that he sent back to our local church, which had sent him
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.300]   out to Kenya.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:49.960]   And I want you to just to listen to the circumstances that Jacob and his family faced and consider
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:56.940]   them in the wake of today's political election and your own life and my own life.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.780]   This past week has been primarily taken up with visiting those in this area who were
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.820]   affected by the turmoil surrounding the presidential election last year.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.460]   For those who may not know of those events, I'll try to summarize with the best information
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.460]   that I have.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.500]   Hopefully, I'm at least 95% correct.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.740]   A presidential election was held towards the end of October last year.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.100]   On the first ballot, the existing president was proclaimed the winner, but the opposition
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.940]   claimed fraud and the Supreme Court also declared the election invalid.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.720]   A second round of voting took place, but the opposition withdrew from that voting, saying
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.540]   nothing had changed and the existing president was elected nearly unanimously, but with about
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.900]   50% of the voters not participating.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.060]   After the first vote, violence erupted in this area that resulted in about 800 homes
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:51.240]   and businesses being burned and about 120 people killed.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.940]   From what I understand, the target of the violence was anybody that was from the same
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.800]   tribe as the president.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.140]   The deadly attacks came without warning, and many were caught fleeing for their lives with
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.660]   nothing but the clothes on their backs.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.660]   A number of believers in this area, along with their neighbors, were among those affected.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.180]   About 300 or so found themselves together running for their lives.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.500]   12 of the men were killed trying to protect their families or possessions in some way.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.660]   There was no transportation available, so they started walking with the goal of reaching
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.340]   a certain town where they thought they might find a refugee camp.
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.240]   One of the men, who was a leading Christian in that area, knew Jacob and led them to Jacob's
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.220]   place where they planned to rest for a couple of days before going on to this other city.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.440]   They started early one morning and reached Jacob's place about 10pm.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.940]   Because they did not know how the neighbors around Jacob would react, they tried to keep
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.460]   their presence as secret as possible.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.860]   They were trying to decide what to do and where to go.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:54.340]   There was no news, so they did not know what was happening even in a town nearby.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.140]   After a few days, the neighbors began to learn of their presence and reacted in a friendly
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.960]   way, bringing food, blankets, and so on.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.860]   Because of this, they decided to stay longer before making a decision.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.180]   During this time, one of the men, not a believer up to that point, stood up and declared that
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.460]   he felt something was happening in him and that he felt they should stay and not go on
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.340]   to this other town.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.780]   This man later became a strong believer.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.840]   It was during this time that Jacob first informed us of the situation, asking for prayer.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.580]   We also helped some with the cost of food, etc.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.460]   As time drew on, the leaders felt they should stay until things calmed down and they could
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.600]   possibly return back home in the near future.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.940]   One brother decided to go back and see if it was safe to return and unfortunately was
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.540]   killed, leaving his family behind.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.940]   This brought the number of men killed to 13, leaving their wives as widows with multiple
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.340]   children to support.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.820]   Feeding and housing 300+ people was not an easy task to say the least.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.940]   However, Jacob's place is large, so between using every available room for sleeping, a
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.540]   couple of rented tents, not really tents but the kind that is used for vendors, and some
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.820]   sleeping outside on the grass, provision was made.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.100]   Cooking was non-stop, both on the inside and outside kitchens, with everybody helping with
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.300]   that, the farming, and so on.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.740]   Fortunately, they had water from the well that was installed last year.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.260]   Bible study and fellowship was also non-stop and resulted in considerable spiritual fruit.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.980]   I was told that at least half of the people turned to the Lord during that time.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.020]   One number given was about 180, some were baptized.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.420]   Finally it became safe to go back and survey the situation.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.980]   Almost all of the homes had been burned, the possessions in the homes stolen, and all of
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.400]   the livestock taken as well.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.960]   Those who had relatives or some other place to go left Jacob's place when it was safe,
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.460]   but that still left more than half with no place to go.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.420]   About 65 homes needed to be rebuilt.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.020]   The leaders here went to the government asking for help, but the response was minimal.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.220]   Over the months that followed, we helped with finances to rebuild the homes at about $200
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.460]   per house.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.940]   This was enough to provide a basic mud structure with a tin roof.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.780]   The size of the houses varied, but I would say that the average was about 12 by 18 feet,
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.420]   some smaller, some larger depending on the situation.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.740]   Sometimes it was just one room and sometimes divided into two.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.280]   On Tuesday we met with about 30 believers and they served us lunch.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.140]   In the next three days we visited as many homes as possible, maybe about 20.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.900]   The country is mountainous, so we spent a lot of time going up and down the hills.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.420]   In each home the believers told of their testimony of losing everything, having no hope, and
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.560]   their thankfulness for our help in giving them a roof over their head again and a place
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.940]   to call home.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.260]   We shared a short word of encouragement and then prayed.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.180]   It was a moving time for all of us in many ways.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.140]   We cannot understand such things from a human point of view, even to understand how evil
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.660]   men can be.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.040]   One husband was killed while trying to carry his wife to safety.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.500]   She is unable to walk from birth.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.940]   Other similar stories would break your heart.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.900]   Only God knows all that took place.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.840]   We heard many touching testimonies.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.980]   We were told that there are now a total of eight gatherings in that area, meeting in
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.580]   homes.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.340]   In my own evaluation, rebuilding the homes was probably the easiest part.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.980]   The obvious need is now to help these people rebuild their lives and establish some sort
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.280]   of income.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.580]   Many depended on their livestock, of which there is none at present.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.780]   In some houses, there is hardly one chair.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.300]   They borrowed chairs from their neighbors for our visit, and some are sleeping on the
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.500]   mud floor.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.020]   We encouraged the leaders to really seek the Lord's wisdom in each case.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.840]   But the deeper need is to see these new believers established in the Lord.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.220]   There are several men laboring diligently to that end.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.960]   They need our urgent prayers.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.220]   May God enable all of us in that ministry.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.120]   How can we understand these things?
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.660]   My answer is that we cannot, but we know that God is good, He does not make a mistake, and
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.420]   even in such crazy calamity, He is drawing men to Himself.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.040]   His eye is on His eternal goal, and He knows how to take what the enemy is doing and work
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.800]   it for His purpose.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.340]   We met today, Saturday, with more elders from other gatherings.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.980]   It was a good time of fellowship, and they were very thankful to meet us.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.140]   What God has in mind for the future, I do not know, but we'll just leave that with
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.340]   God.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.900]   One thing that is happening here at Jacob's Place is a university-sponsored project for
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.500]   the good of the community.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.860]   The project involves working with the land for soil and water conservation, growing some
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.020]   experimental crops in the greenhouse to see what works best, raising rabbits (60 cages
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.580]   were built last week), a barn for milk cows which collects the manure and urine for fertilizer,
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.300]   a fish pond, and so on.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.720]   Jacob's Place has been designated as the "pilot project" for the community.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.380]   The university is funding the project and will then bring students from the university
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.620]   for training.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.360]   The community around this place will then be brought in to learn how they can reproduce
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.620]   what is taking place here in their own place.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.300]   I rejoice in what I see because it will be another open door for the gospel in many ways.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.300]   It is an answer to prayer.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.980]   And with that, my dad just closed with a couple of personal paragraphs, and that was the end
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   of it.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.460]   Now, I want you to imagine those circumstances.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.620]   I want you to imagine the circumstances of 300 people living in your home and on your
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.300]   property.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:13.380]   Or imagine yourself in the circumstance of a refugee fleeing for your life with your
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.920]   family.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.900]   Imagine the circumstance of you as a husband trying to carry your wife to safety and your
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:30.240]   attackers coming along and killing you, for no other reason than political conflict largely
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:37.340]   driven by ethnic and racial strife and hatred.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:44.540]   And then compare that to the tension that you might feel today given political strife
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.820]   in your area.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:57.260]   And be grateful for the peace that you're experiencing in your community.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:04.260]   If you want to have a greater appreciation for your day today, I simply urge you to think
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:14.180]   about that, to appreciate the peace that allows you to go down to a local polling place, that
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:20.340]   allows you to cast your ballot if you choose to vote, and to stand in line with people
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.420]   who vigorously disagree with you, and then to leave.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.660]   And you don't go in fear of your life.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.020]   You don't go in fear of your property.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.140]   You don't go worrying if tonight you'll wake up with a band of thugs carrying torches
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.580]   ready to lynch you as they surround your house.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.860]   You don't worry about them burning your house down, taking and stealing your animals, and
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.140]   just looting your business.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.140]   It's not the society that you live in.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.480]   Be thankful for that, because that is a monumental achievement.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.700]   To live in orderly, peaceful societies, to be in the circumstances that you and I live
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:06.700]   in, to be in this place where we worry about what riders to put on our insurance policy,
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:13.620]   and to worry about the stuff that I talk about every day, these things that on a global scale
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:20.420]   seem so inconsequential but yet are so important to us, that's a luxury.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:26.900]   And may we never lose sight of how truly privileged and blessed we are.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.940]   Because today, in other elections that happen around the world, not everybody experiences
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.200]   those same things.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.700]   Also don't lose sight of the fact of how hard it is to get the information.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.460]   All the information that I shared with you, never been able to verify it with any news
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.420]   reporting other than a sentence or two here or there, an illusion.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.580]   You say, "How can that be?"
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:54.460]   Because if in where you and I lived, where you and I live, if there were hundreds of
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.500]   people killed and hundreds of homes burned down, that would be front page news.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.040]   It would.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.740]   But not when it happens in a rural part of Kenya.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.420]   It's not of much interest to most of our news sources.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.740]   But it doesn't mean that it's not happening.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:16.420]   Again, that's personally verified, frankly, by my own father, who we had a lot of extensive
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.700]   interaction over the course of the last couple of years.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.820]   And then he's just returned from a two-month visit there.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.020]   So I want you to appreciate that.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:38.300]   In your own political battles, I'd also just encourage you to always stand for vigorous
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.520]   public debate on issues that matter.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:49.980]   Violence is – physical violence is usually flamed when there's not an outlet for vigorous
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.060]   public debate.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:58.880]   My concerns personally is if there is suppression of vigorous public debate of ideas, that ultimately
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.060]   can lead to increasing political violence.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:08.260]   I don't want to live in society like that society in Kenya, where there is no outlet
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.100]   for vigorous public debate and people feel no choice but to turn to violence.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.420]   I don't want to live in that society.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.540]   Now, just a few more lessons or suggestions for things for you to comment on.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:28.680]   Notice that in situations, in extreme situations, you're going to look for your friends and
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.180]   neighbors and you're going to stick up for one another.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:40.780]   And the strength of your community now will – frankly, will guide the outcome of your
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.900]   success in an extreme situation like that.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:49.020]   So the more you can do to build in your local community, the stronger your local community,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.900]   the more insulated you can be from some of the potential tragedy.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:00.420]   I probably take a more extreme form of financial preparedness than many people do.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:06.500]   I don't think it's weird to talk about financial preparedness that involves good
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.420]   financial diversification and it involves the fact that you and your family might have
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.180]   to flee in the middle of the night from a bunch of thugs with torches surrounding your
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.180]   house.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.940]   That's because these stories are not uncommon on a global basis.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.620]   They're uncommon in the United States of America today.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.860]   They weren't uncommon in the United States of America 50 years ago, but they're uncommon
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.300]   in the United States of America today and they're not uncommon on a global basis.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:38.580]   I think we'd be well-served to think about that and to consider that in our own thoughts
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.420]   and in our own planning.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.060]   So when I think about what would I do or how would I get my family out, that's where
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.220]   some of this comes from.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.340]   It's just to say this is the reality that many people face.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.340]   I could go on.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.380]   I'll let you draw your own lessons, but consider.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.140]   Consider how peaceful your life is today.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.580]   Though you feel the turmoil of hot political debate, though you feel the frustration and
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:09.860]   feel like this is the most important election of your lifetime, appreciate at the very least
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:17.020]   the monumental civilizational achievement that is represented by peaceful, orderly
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:25.700]   voting and a citizenry that stands ready to accept the outcome of that voting.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.940]   Frankly, one of the most important things about the American experiment is that Americans
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:41.540]   did not come together on the basis of race, religion, tribal affiliation, ethnic identification,
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.700]   but around a set of principles and a set of ideas, the American creed.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.700]   And if that American creed is strong, it leads to a harmony in civilization.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.580]   If that American creed is weak, who knows?
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.140]   Now where we go from here, I don't know.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.780]   But at the very least, appreciate the peace that you can experience today in your own
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:10.580]   life and don't let the political battles take an outsized influence in the harmony
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:28.500]   of your own personal life.
