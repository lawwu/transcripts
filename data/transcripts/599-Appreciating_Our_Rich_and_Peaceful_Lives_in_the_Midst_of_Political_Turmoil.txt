[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.880]   They actually did flee in basically in what was the middle of the night,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   flee across the countryside to escape the risk of their life and managed to make it from one part of the country to another part of the country where their tribal ethnicity would not cause them so many problems.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.760]   Jacob and his wife had developed their own farm prior to their having to flee.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   And in fleeing from that farm, they've ran away from their home.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   Jacob and his wife had developed their own farm prior to their having to flee.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   And in fleeing from that farm, they've ran away from their home.

[00:08:34.760 --> 00:09:04.300]   I ran the risk of having it all left behind.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:04.320]   Now, thankfully, after they were gone, they were able to negotiate the sale of their previous farm.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.340]   And they were able to negotiate the lease, hopefully leading to a purchase of a newer farm.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:04.380]   This newer farm was a great opportunity that landed in their lap because it was unlike many of the structures and the farms in the area.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:04.400]   It had been built by a wealthy man who had basically built it up as his retirement project.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:04.420]   And in the area, they were able to negotiate the sale of their farm.

[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   a great opportunity that landed in their farm.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   a great opportunity that they were able to the farm.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:12.360]   And yet, through a variety of miraculous circumstances, and when I use the word miraculous, I don't use it lightly.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.960]   I use it in its sincere and true sense.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:25.340]   Through a variety of miraculous circumstances, Jacob and his wife came to be the tenants and the owners, ultimately, of this farm.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:33.740]   This farm was unique because it had large buildings, well-built structures, unlike most of the local structures, which are basically mud huts.

[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   Now, that was the first of many unique steps in their own financial journey.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   Now, that was the first of many unique steps in their own financial journey.

[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   Again, consider fleeing from where you live to another part of the country because of the risk of you and your family basically being lynched in the middle of the night because you're from the wrong ethnic tribe.

[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:33.240]   So, Jacob is there. There are about a dozen orphans that he had known prior to the flood, and, and they were newly orphaned that day. Again, the children were away at school in a higher part of the country, not down in the canyon where the flash flood was, and their, their parents were killed in the flash flood. So, of course, them knowing Jacob and him knowing them, he took them home to care for them for a few days while they were there.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   So, of course, them knowing Jacob and him knowing them, he took them home to care for them for a few days while they were there.

[00:11:33.260 --> 00:12:02.740]   Well, they figured out what the plan would be.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:02.740]   Now, as time went on, ultimately, he tried to work with the government, and tried to understand how these orphans could be helped.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:02.740]   But Kenya has a, a very unique challenge with orphans, and there's basically no infrastructure, no governmental infrastructure for the support of orphans. And so, at the end of the day, after going back and forth with the governmental authorities for a time, he was basically told, "Either you care for them or put them out on the street. There's no other option." And putting orphan children out on the street, it's kind of like, "Well, I'm going to live here," and I'm going to live here."
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:32.240]  , and I'm going to live here." And so, he and his wife, couldn't put them out on the street, and they decided, "Well, we'll deal with this together." So, live or die, we'll all be in this together. And so, he and his wife adopted the 12 orphans, bringing their family size up, obviously, rather significantly. I don't remember the exact number. I think they had four biological children, but they were all the same age.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.740]   But, they were able to live together.

[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   a number of believers in this area, along with their neighbors, were among those affected. About 300 or so found themselves together running for their lives. Twelve of the men were killed trying to protect their families or possessions in some way. There was no transportation available, so they started walking with the goal of reaching a certain town where they thought they might find a refugee camp. One of the men, who was a leading Christian in that area, knew Jacob and led them to Jacob's place where they planned to rest for a couple of days before going to the camp.
