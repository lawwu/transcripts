[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   Pastor John, here's an email—not an uncommon email—from a listener who writes in to ask
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   this, "If I've never read the Bible by myself before, where should I start?"
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.560]   Oh, I would love to talk to such a person, so I hope he or she is listening.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.640]   So let's start at ground zero.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.640]   Absolute zero.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   A few big picture things that'll help my simple, straightforward answer make sense.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.740]   The Bible is a collection of 66 distinct books.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.280]   These were written by different people over a span of about 1,500 years, which makes their
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.560]   amazing harmony and unity and development all the more amazing.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.080]   But it's important to realize that there were numerous authors, human authors, not
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.840]   just one.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.440]   So these 66 books in the one book called the Bible are different kinds of writing.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.620]   Some are history, some are poetry, some is prophecy, some are letters, and so on.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.640]   Different styles.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.880]   And these are divided into two parts, right, called the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.960]   The word "testament" is an old word for agreement or covenant about the way God was
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.120]   dealing with his people.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.800]   The Old Covenant are the books written before Jesus Christ came into the world, and the
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.080]   New Covenant are the books written after Jesus Christ.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.200]   So the Old Testament are books that are preparing for the coming of the Son of God into the
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.880]   world, Jesus Christ, and the New Testament is about what he did, who he was, how he started
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.440]   the Christian movement, and how we are to live as Christians in the light of all of
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   that.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.300]   So 39 books in the Old and 27 books in the New.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.600]   So where should you start in this big library of God-inspired, true books?
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.360]   My answer is, since Jesus is the central figure in the Bible, and he explains everything else,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.520]   if you understand Jesus, you're going to be able to understand the other parts better.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.840]   Then you need to get to know him first.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.040]   There are four books at the beginning of the New Testament that give an account of his
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.320]   ministry, and somewhat of his life, although none of them covers every year of his life,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.920]   because what he did in his last three years was all-important, so that's what they focus
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   on.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.720]   And these four books are called the Gospels, the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   The word "gospel" means "good news," and this is the foundation of our good news, called
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   the Gospel.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   Here's where I'd start.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.320]   The Gospel of Mark is the shortest one, 16 short chapters.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   I would start there, and here's the way I'd do it.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.440]   I would set aside two hours, some Sunday morning or Saturday evening, or sometimes when you're
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.560]   going to stay awake, and read the whole thing straight through, 16 chapters.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.800]   And I say two hours because I'm a slow reader, and I've done that.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.160]   I've sat down, read the entire Gospel of Mark straight through.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.360]   You might be able to do it in one hour.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.480]   And that'll give you an overview of the ministry of Jesus.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.680]   It's very fast-paced, clip, clip, clip, clip.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.040]   One of the most common words in Mark is "immediate."
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.720]   And then, the second thing I would do is do the same thing with the Gospel of John.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.400]   It's longer, 21 chapters, and they're longer.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.200]   Mark is fast-paced, riddled with action, the sorts of things Jesus did.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.000]   John is reflective, slower-paced, contains lots and lots of the teachings of Jesus, gets
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.320]   you inside his mind and heart and being in a concerted and focused way.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.880]   And then, when you've read Mark and John, just to get you exposed to what he did and
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.400]   what he taught and who he was, I would point you in two directions, depending on the kind
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.960]   of person you are.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.680]   If you're a lover of seeing things systematized and organized into a beautiful whole, go to
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.680]   Romans next, the letter to the Romans, another 16 chapters.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.240]   Or if you are the kind of person who loves fast-paced action and want to see what happened,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.320]   what happened, how did this movement move on in the world, then go to the book of Acts.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.960]   You can hear the very title.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.160]   And this is how the Gospel gets from Jerusalem at the death and resurrection of Jesus all
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.920]   the way to Rome about 30 years later in the amazing works of God to establish his church.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.080]   And the last thing I would say is, there's a book in the Bible, right smack in the middle
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   of the Bible.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.720]   If you flop your Bible open to smack in the middle, it's going to open to Psalms.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.160]   150 Psalms.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.060]   These are the prayers and the songs of the people of God, many of them written by King
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.820]   David of Israel.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.440]   And they capture all the moods and the ups and downs and struggles of God's people.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   And there are a lot of people who love this book more than any book in the Bible.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   My wife would say Psalms is her favorite book.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.120]   And that's the approach I would take.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.920]   It would give you that last exposure, would give you a way to manage lots of the feelings
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.280]   you're going to have as a new Christian.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.520]   But let yourself be caught up in what amazes you.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.320]   Don't consider my advice or anybody's advice where you have to read.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.200]   It's all God's Word.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.720]   It's all inspired and reliable.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.120]   All of it's profitable to help you know Christ and know how to be saved from sin and from
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.360]   condemnation and how to have eternal life and how to live a life pleasing to God in
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   this world.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.680]   So you're on the brink of the greatest adventure of your life.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.400]   Amen.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   Very well put.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.720]   And if you'd like to open the Bible and study with Pastor John himself, we recently launched
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.380]   a series of video tutorials called "Look at the Book."
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.400]   You can check those out at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.560]   Click on the tab that says "Labs" on the top of the screen.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.960]   And tomorrow we return with a question about how we can go deeper with Christ and our union
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960]   with Christ.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.720]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   [END]
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   1.
