[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.000]   Awesome. Hi everyone. My name is Adina. I'm the CEO of Divi Homes. It's a pleasure to meet y'all.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   Thank you for being here.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:28.400]   All right. So while they're pulling that up, I will just kick it off and get started because
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.160]   we're about three hours behind at this point. My passions are at the crossroads of finance,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.360]   housing, and inequality and trying to solve all of these. I'll get into what my company does at
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.760]   the very end of the presentation. That's not what I really want to focus on, but I want to start off
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.520]   with a little story that I think explains why this is so important to me. When it was about the 1980s,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.000]   my mom decided to go on a little road trip with her friends and she was in
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.080]   Israel and she was backpacking and she was hitchhiking and a man picked her up. She got into
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.160]   that car, fell in love and got pregnant. That man is my dad. My mom and dad quickly got married,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.800]   immigrated back to the US and found themselves very young, 21 and 24, pregnant and trying to
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.880]   figure out what they were going to do with their life. They couldn't get a mortgage to buy a house
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.080]   and settle down and be able to raise a family, but they were fortunate enough to find a woman who
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.600]   gave them seller financing, who was a very successful woman, and who was a very successful woman. So,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.440]   she was able to get a mortgage to pay for the house. She was able to pay for the house,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.560]   so she let my parents pay in installments. In that house, they had three additional kids. I'm
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.160]   the third of four. Eventually, we were able to get a mortgage, take cash out of that house,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.680]   and use the cash that they took out to pay for all four kids to go to college.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.240]   I tell you this because to me, this is the heart of the American dream, which is being able to
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.200]   provide a better life for your children than what you actually have. So, so much of what we're going
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.040]   to be talking about here is why that American dream has disappeared for so many Americans,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.240]   and what we at Divi are doing to try to address that. So, let's dive in. I have these bright
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.000]   blue slides. The goal is to just give you the takeaway so you don't have to figure it out. I
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.520]   try to stick to one chart per slide to keep it super simple, and I'll explain it, but this is
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.440]   the takeaway that you should get from the next couple of data points I'm going to give you,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.800]   which is wealth inequality is rising across America. I think you all know this chart,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.960]   which is that 99% of wealth is owned by the top 50%, and the bottom 50% only own 1% of wealth here
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.360]   in the United States. So, this chart shows distribution of wealth by what your household
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.800]   income is. So, the top 10% of owners, sorry, the top 10% own 76% of wealth. The next 40% own 23%
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.760]   of wealth. You sum that up, 99% of wealth is owned by the top 50%. What's even more interesting is
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.400]   that the rich are getting the wealth. The rich are getting the wealth. The rich are getting the wealth.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.280]   are getting richer while the poor kind of stay at the same level of income and
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.040]   so what this chart actually shows is income percentiles so on the x-axis the
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.960]   zero is if you're at the very bottom end of the income spectrum 100% you're at
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.820]   the top end and then the blue line is how much income or family household
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.580]   wealth you had in 1963 almost 50 years ago and the yellow line shows how much
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.160]   wealth you have today so if you were in the top 1% your household wealth was on
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.020]   average two million dollars 50 years ago today it's about ten million dollars or
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.380]   a 5x growth and if you were in the bottom 50th percentile you haven't seen
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.420]   your household income change almost at all and so you might be asking okay why
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.600]   is this the case is it that wealthy people are making more in salary I would
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.400]   say while there are some salary differentials the main driver is asset
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.800]   appreciation access to assets and when I say assets I'm gonna use that pretty
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.920]   liberally it can mean stocks it can mean housing it can mean
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.820]   small businesses direct investments but all of that I'm a group together as
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.680]   investments in assets and so you can see this is a really simple chart where I
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.040]   took what were the 20-year returns by income as well as asset and you can see
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.220]   that household income has not appreciated much in the last 20 years
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.620]   whereas the S&P 500 as well as if you owned equity in your home you'd see an
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.480]   increase in your value of over a hundred percent you want to see something even
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.680]   crazier you get leverage on your home you get leverage on your home you get
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.380]   leverage on your home equity which is something that most of you some of you
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.040]   might get get leverage against your equity that you mess in the stock market
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.660]   but most of you aren't and you can actually lever up your home equity right
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.240]   and so you can take out debt that's cheap because it's backed and guaranteed
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.720]   by the government 80% leverage at what has been almost 3% cost of capital no
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.560]   one else can get that sort of cost of capital at that sort of leverage and
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.440]   you're forced to amortize so you build up savings in the
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.820]   property and a house has dual utility you cannot live in the S&P 500 you can
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.660]   live in a home so if we click on and so the takeaway has to be those who own
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.460]   assets are more likely to have a higher net worth and so this is a chart that I
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.000]   sold from the New York Times so credit goes to them but if you look on the
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.820]   left-hand side the blue bars all of the bars kind of sum up to 100% going across
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.200]   so the blue bars is the percent of family so bottom 50 percentile of income earners 50% 50 to 80%
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.800]   percentile 30% so on and what this is saying is that the bottom 50% of families
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.580]   and households own 1% of overall equities in the market and when you look
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.720]   at directly held stocks so stocks in the stock market they own 0% right and if
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.500]   you look at the top 1% of income earners they own 38% of overall equities which
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.700]   includes like retirement accounts and everything remember said that big asset
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.960]   class and they own 51% of the total equity in the market so that's a lot of
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.780]   money so if you look at the bottom 50% of income earners they own 31% of all
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.180]   directly held stocks so if you ask why are the rich getting richer it is
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.880]   because they own assets assets compound over time there's also a ton of tax
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.940]   benefits around owning assets long-term capital gains which I'm sure you all
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.760]   know another way to look at this which I think is really interesting is your net
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.720]   worth by renter versus homeowner homeowners on
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.020]   the other hand if you look at the bottom 50% of the total equity in the market
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.680]   you're going to see that the homeowner is actually the most likely to own the
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.100]   most of the total equity in the market and that's because they own the most of
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.280]   the total equity in the market so that's why they're the most likely to own the
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.340]   most of the total equity in the market and that's because they own the most of
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.220]   the total equity in the market so that's why they're the most likely to own the
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.280]   most of the total equity in the market so that's why they're the most likely to
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.100]   own the most of the total equity in the market so that's why they're the most
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.480]   likely to own the most of the total equity in the market so that's why they're
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.020]   because the debt amortizes, you're forced to save over time.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.680]   It's highly liquid; it's hard to take your money out of it.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.540]   It is what makes a great investment.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.880]   And so when you look at why this chart is so high,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.420]   it's not because homeowners are saving a tremendous amount more.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.260]   They're saving, they're putting money into the equity of the home.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.340]   They're being forced to in their payments.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.540]   So, despite the benefits of homeownership,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.780]   it is starting to become fundamentally inaccessible.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.380]   So this is a chart, really simple, of average home prices.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.120]   There's a bunch of different sources you can measure home prices,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.420]   but you can see that at the bottom of the recession,
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.900]   which was actually 2012 for home prices,
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.060]   the average home price in America was $163,000,
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.880]   and that today it's closer to $338,000.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.680]   That's a 200 percent increase in 10 years.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.640]   At the same time, real median income has only increased
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.240]   from about $57,000 to $67,000.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.640]   So what has caused prices for homes to increase so dramatically?
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.420]   I'm pretty sure that none of this is new news.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.680]   You all have been seeing how much home prices have risen.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.060]   For those of you who have bought while interest rates were still 3%,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.980]   good on you because that is probably the lowest
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.720]   they're going to be in a really, really long time.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.800]   But here's the quick history, which is from 2000 to 2008,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.440]   we were building on average 1.5 billion homes,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   sorry, million homes a year, not billion, gosh.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.780]   1.5 million homes a year,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.840]   and that equated to roughly four to five months of inventory.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.520]   Months of inventory mean that if there were no more homes
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.720]   that were put on the market,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.020]   how long would it take to sell all those homes?
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.220]   Four to five months.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.600]   And that's generally considered a balanced real estate market.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.460]   Then what happened? The global financial crisis.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.600]   There was a mass number of foreclosures.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.760]   The market was completely flooded,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.800]   and all of a sudden you could buy an existing home
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.640]   that was going into foreclosure
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.540]   for $163,000.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.980]   And so builders who had to pay for labor, for lumber,
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.080]   to actually build a house,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.360]   couldn't build a house for that cheap.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.960]   The cheapest that a home builder can build a home
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.160]   is roughly $200,000, all in costs.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.660]   And so if you can sit there and you're like,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.460]   I can only build a house for $200,000,
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.100]   which means I have to sell it for more than $200,000,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.440]   well, I can't compete with existing foreclosure inventory.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.360]   So home builders stopped building.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.840]   They went from building,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:26.180]   1.5 million a year down to about 750,000 homes a year after that.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.220]   And it stayed like that until about 2015.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.180]   And at that point,
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.560]   a lot of the inventory that came from foreclosures were absorbed
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.220]   and they started actually rebuilding again,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.960]   but they didn't rebuild at the same rate that they had prior.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.060]   We're rebuilding right now.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.660]   We're building probably new inventories,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.100]   one point, I'd say 1.2 million annually.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.040]   And so then this massive thing happened, which is COVID.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.440]   And all of a sudden, everyone went from living in their studio apartment
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.040]   to saying, I need a backyard,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.540]   I need an extra room for childcare,
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.080]   and I need an office.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.480]   And there was this mass spike in demand
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.660]   after years of not building enough inventory.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.280]   And so what happens when demand starts to spike
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.460]   and there's not a lot of supply?
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.160]   Well, home prices took off,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.300]   which you can kind of see right over here
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.840]   is that little spiky part at the very end.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.060]   And what's amazing is that it's actually just gotten incredibly harder,
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.240]   not just because home prices are getting more and more high,
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.640]   not just because home prices are getting more expensive,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.980]   but because of the impact that that has
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.880]   in terms of how much you actually need to save to buy a home.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.680]   So the left-hand chart shows,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.220]   the yellow bar is your average down payment,
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.580]   and you can see that that's grown roughly 2x.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.000]   At the same time, median income in the last 20 years hasn't gone up.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.220]   So on an absolute dollar basis,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.760]   you now need to save 2x the amount
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.500]   that you would have had to save back in 2000.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.900]   So one, it's down payment is an issue.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.240]   The second issue is that post-global,
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.540]   financial crisis, rightly so,
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.580]   the government tightened underwriting requirements.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.040]   They said, you know what?
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.020]   Turns out when you cause a global worldwide recession,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.760]   we should maybe change how we're doing things.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.520]   And so they pulled back and said,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.080]   we're going to make you have a higher FICO
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.220]   in order to be able to purchase a home,
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.560]   which is probably the right answer,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.960]   but also pretty painful because people don't wake up one day
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.060]   and they're like, I no longer need a home, right?
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.340]   And so if you take a look at this,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.440]   the average FICO for home buyers
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.900]   is well above what the average FICO is for the general population,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.040]   and the average FICO for home buyers is well above what the average FICO is for the general population,
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.640]   and anyone who's under 45 years is even lower
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.680]   because FICO cures over time.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.920]   And so what does this all come together and say is that
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.680]   unless you have the ability to save 2x the amount,
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.860]   unless you are above average in terms of FICO
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.060]   when you're starting off your life in a starter home,
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.560]   you're going to struggle to actually be able to buy a home.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.520]   Now this chart seems a little confusing,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.300]   but I think it's really important to look at and understand,
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.800]   so I'll walk you through it.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.700]   So what this chart shows is mortgage rates.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.260]   3%, 6%, 9%.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.480]   We were at 3%, call it a year ago,
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.040]   we're at I think 5.5% right now is roughly where the 30-year fixed is.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.940]   And then 9%, who knows, maybe, hopefully not in the future.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.980]   And that says what is your mortgage tax and insurance payments,
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.920]   what you have to include for a $400,000 home,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.960]   which is roughly average home price.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.660]   And I know a little different in Miami,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.960]   but this is kind of across the U.S.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.660]   And then I said how much income do you need
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.360]   in order to get that mortgage?
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.500]   And you can see that your income that you need
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   goes from about $94,000 of household income
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.400]   up to about $160,000 of household income.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.900]   And then I said how many households could qualify for that?
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.480]   Because there's data on how much income households make across the U.S.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.180]   There are 126 million households in the U.S.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.320]   And you can see that historically almost 40% --
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.980]   sorry, 30% of households actually could afford a mortgage
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.120]   where we were before,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.020]   and that number today has gone down to now 22%
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.960]   and will go down to about less than 15% of people
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.700]   who can actually get a mortgage on a home.
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.060]   This is insane.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.860]   So over here I kind of -- I like to just overly simplify things,
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.960]   so I kind of put it here, which is a $10,000 increase
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.240]   in home prices means 1 million fewer families can own a home,
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.940]   or a 1% increase in mortgage rates means 5 million families
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.540]   can actually own a home.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.280]   So we're in a little bit of a tough situation here.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.680]   So when I started Divi, the goal was to help solve wealth
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.280]   inequality by giving Americans access to assets.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.220]   This is the sole goal, the purpose,
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.820]   what I really believe in, which is that access to assets
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.860]   and compounding wealth in something
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.960]   that you cannot easily pull your money out of
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.260]   and you just leave it there is the way
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.300]   that we can help people generate wealth for their families,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.600]   for their children, for their next generation.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.480]   So the way Divi works is very similar to a mortgage,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.340]   except it's not a mortgage.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.340]   You come to our website.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:45.940]   You apply.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.900]   We give you a budget.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.340]   So we might say, hey, you're approved
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.740]   for a $500,000 home in Miami.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.980]   Go out shopping.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.220]   You shop with your realtor the same way you would
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.560]   with a mortgage, and when you're ready to buy a home,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.620]   you just let us know what home you choose.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.780]   We say, great.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.300]   We put out an all-cash, quick-close offer for you,
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.020]   so you can compete with every other investor offer that's
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.700]   out there.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.400]   We'll take care of it for you, because we know how
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.860]   to bid on these homes.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.640]   We then take care of the inspections.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.000]   We cover all closing costs, all fees, everything.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.340]   We head to closing, and you commit either 1% to 2% down,
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.300]   which is about a tenth of a usual down payment.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.840]   Down payments are 10% to 20%.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.920]   We say 1% to 2%, and that's your initial equity in the home.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.640]   You own that.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.080]   That is yours.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   And then you move in.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.120]   You make one monthly payment, part rent, part equity,
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.020]   the same way a mortgage is principal and interest,
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.320]   and the equity piece builds up your percent ownership.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.720]   We let you build up to 10% over the course of three years.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.660]   At any point in time, you can get a mortgage
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.100]   or refinance and take us out, or you can cash out your equity
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.200]   and walk away hopefully with tens of thousands
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.940]   of dollars saved up.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.200]   So that is how we work.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.280]   We operate in 16 metros.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.840]   Our biggest ones are Georgia, Texas, and Florida.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.580]   Florida is a big one, up in Tampa.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.980]   The average income of our customers is about a $50,000
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.620]   to $150,000 household income.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.760]   50% of our customers are people of color, and 80%
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.320]   of our transactions are female-led.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:20.060]   And so I think the most important thing is are we
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.960]   successful in our mission and what we're trying to do?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   So 51% of DIVI customers who have come to the end
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.160]   of their three-year lease have been able
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.460]   to buy back their home.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.680]   Probably another 20% on top of it aren't yet ready
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.900]   for mortgage, and so we just let them build more equity over time.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.100]   And about 30% of people turn over,
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.240]   which is completely fine.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.280]   Sometimes you have an extra kid or two,
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.320]   and you need a bigger home, and that's okay.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.060]   We actually love that people can cash
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.840]   out their money and continue moving on.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.940]   Over here we have what I think is one of the more powerful things,
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.400]   which is the average renter savings versus the average
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.580]   savings that a DIVI customer has in their home.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.480]   We're almost 25 times the savings that the average renter has,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.980]   and this is because they are building up equity
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.340]   in their property over time.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.980]   Over here, just to show, we're growing quickly,
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.280]   and we're doing it profitably.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.920]   Actually, I think this is super important is you can sit here
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.800]   and say that you are building a mission-oriented company,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.040]   you have to show scale.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.780]   You have to show growth, and you have to show
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.940]   that people there is adoption,
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.640]   and you're actually having an impact.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.940]   And so this year alone we'll deploy over a billion dollars
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.240]   of capital.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   We measure a margin as the rent that we collect,
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.720]   less home costs, less interest, so it's
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.520]   like a true profit all-in margin,
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.360]   where we're almost probably going to be
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.620]   at about 25% all-in profit margin.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.700]   And now I think we have -- yeah, thank you.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.540]   I think that there is a video, but I don't know
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.540]   if they're showing it.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.940]   So we can maybe go to Q and A if we're running close on time.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.340]   Let's go, yeah.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.140]   Okay, cool.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.440]   Thank you.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:59.080]   I know that Freeburg's going to talk to you
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.120]   about consumer credit, but let me just tee up something before.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.060]   There's a tweet, I just want to read it to you,
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.640]   and maybe we can use this as a jumping off point.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.280]   Blackstone calls homes almost as unaffordable as the 2007 peak.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.520]   They just said that today.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.380]   His name is Joe Zittle, who's I guess a senior partner there.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.160]   But he believes a crash is unlikely due to a major difference,
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.860]   which is that most owners aren't using their homes like an ATM,
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.120]   like they did back then.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.560]   Can you just explain sort of the broader state of housing actually
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.640]   and why some people feel like we're actually --
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.080]   Okay.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.480]   Right at the brink of a crisis again, and some people don't?
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.020]   Okay, yeah, interesting.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.960]   So the global financial crisis is very different than this
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.520]   because it was obviously a housing-led crisis
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.900]   where we had people overextend and they didn't have enough equity
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.740]   that was built up in their house to cushion a decline in home prices.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.800]   I'd say that this is a very different situation today,
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.500]   and I'd say that because one, we don't have a lot of supply.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.000]   And so fundamentally when you're thinking about pricing,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.780]   supply and demand dynamics, number one,
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.480]   we don't have a lot of supply.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.760]   Now what you can probably argue is there is an equilibrium point, meaning,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.700]   you know, we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.100]   We're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.300]   We're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.500]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.700]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.800]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.000]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.200]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.400]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.700]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.000]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.280]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.540]   So we're going to have to increase the demand.
