[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   Pastor John, is it true to say that every man has a thirst in his soul for God he
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.200]   is trying to fill with sin, and also to say that every man is spiritually dead?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.840]   In other words, is it right to talk about a spiritual longing being filled by sin
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.000]   in a spiritually dead soul? How do you think about that?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.920]   I have three kinds of responses to this. One, definitions are always crucial. The
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.120]   question is, is it right to talk about a spiritual, underline the word spiritual,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.360]   longing in a spiritually dead soul, that is in the unregenerate. If a
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.800]   person means, can a spiritually dead person have a religious longing? And the
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.240]   answer is yes. In fact, that's what religions are driven by, desires and
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.360]   longings that the spiritually dead people have, very deep desires and
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.640]   and willings and choices and passions. But if we stick to the New Testament,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.280]   the most relevant New Testament definition, is it right to talk about a
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.760]   spiritual longing in a spiritually dead soul? The most relevant definition in
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.120]   this regard is to take the term spiritual longing in the same way as
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.440]   spiritually dead, and that means spiritual is enlivened and prompted and
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.240]   shaped and guided by the Holy Spirit. That's what spiritual means. And the key
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.640]   text there is 1 Corinthians 2, 13 and 14, and the opposite of spiritual is not
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.720]   secular or non-religious. The opposite is natural or minus God, a human being
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.520]   minus God, human being minus spirit. So the text says, "We impart these teachings
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.240]   in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.520]   spiritual truths," there's the phrase, "spiritual truths to those who are
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.320]   spiritual." And then he clarifies, verse 14, "the natural person," that's the
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.000]   opposite of spiritual. So a person just what they are by nature apart from God.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.760]   The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.120]   folly to him and he is not able to understand them because they are
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.800]   spiritually discerned. So now the question is, is it right to talk about a
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:56.240]   Holy Spirit enlivened, prompted, shaped, guided longing in a soul that has no
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.680]   Holy Spirit given life? And the answer is no. Those souls don't have any such
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.560]   longing. So that's my first observation, which is basically to clarify the
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:16.680]   definition of spiritual. But there's more that needs to be said to help fill out
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.240]   the picture of what we mean by spiritually dead. It does sound strange,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.960]   this is my second observation, it does sound strange to lots of people to think
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   of a dead soul with the incredible amount of activity that the dead soul
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.640]   has in the New Testament. If you just take the main text on deadness
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.920]   in Ephesians 2, the deadness apart from Christ, this soul that is dead is
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.160]   amazingly energetic. Let's just read it and listen. "And you were dead," this is
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Ephesians 2, 1 to 3, "and you were dead in trespasses and sins in which you once
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.680]   walked." So you know, a walker who's dead. "According to the course of this world,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.320]   according to the Prince of the power of the air," so this soul is very responsive
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.720]   to the world and the devil, verse 3, "among whom we all once lived or
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.920]   conducted ourselves." So this soul is conducting itself, it's making choices,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   it's acting in ways that are appropriate to its nature, in the passions of
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.560]   our flesh, and then it says, "doing the desires of the body and the mind." So
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.900]   there's plenty of desires, there's plenty of doing, there's plenty of living, there's
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.360]   plenty of walking. This is an incredibly active soul, and that's not unique to
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.880]   Ephesians 2. As Jesus said in John 3, "What is born of the flesh is flesh, and
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.760]   what is born of the Spirit is spirit." In other words, our first birth makes us
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   merely flesh, and our second birth makes us alive to the Holy Spirit, and our
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.800]   spirit comes alive. But when we are just flesh, when we're natural, to use Paul's
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.400]   language, there are, Paul says, lots of works of the flesh. He says the works of
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.520]   the flesh are sexual morality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.600]   strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalry, dissensions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:32.840]   things like that. In other words, a dead soul is a very active soul, which is
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:41.560]   strange. We must not confuse deadness of soul or spirit or heart with inactivity
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.880]   or having no powers at all. The dead, natural soul is filled with energy to
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.240]   desire and to do, which now leads to the third and last clarification
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.720]   that I wanted to make. What the questioner, I think, asks is, "Can a
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:07.800]   spiritually dead person have a thirst for God that he's trying to fill with
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.000]   sin?" And in that sense, he says, "Is it right to talk about a spiritual longing
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.120]   that is a real longing for the true God," I think he means, "in a spiritually dead
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.480]   soul that is unregenerate?" In other words, I think he's asking, "Is there such a
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.320]   thing as a true seeker?" There's a lot of churches built around seeker-sensitive
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:42.480]   views of church, and here's Paul's answer, but stay tuned. There's more. His
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.360]   answer is, Romans 3, 9, "Jews and Greeks are under sin, as it is written, 'None is
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:56.200]   righteous, no, not one. No one understands, no one seeks for God.'" Now that's a pretty
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.240]   strong statement. No one, apart from Christ, apart from the Holy Spirit, no
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.200]   dead soul seeks for God. Now what does he mean? Because we don't want to say more
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.880]   here than we should, and I think Romans 8, 7 and 1 Corinthians 2, 14 are
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.440]   what he means. He says, "For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, it
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.400]   does not submit to God's law, indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.880]   cannot please God." Or, 1 Corinthians, "The natural person does not welcome, does not
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.920]   receive the things of the Spirit of God, that is, who by their unrighteousness," he
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.120]   says in chapter 1 of Romans, "suppress the truth." So I think what Paul means by
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.920]   "no natural person," no unregenerate, unborn-again person, seeks for God, I
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.120]   think what he means is, yes, they have longings of heart and desiring hearts
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:03.220]   and yearning hearts, and yes, this longing, desiring, yearning heart was made by God
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:11.060]   and for God, and yes, this longing for something more than what is in this
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:17.080]   world is true. As C. S. Lewis said, "It's a sign that we're made for another world."
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.040]   It says, "Hunger is evidence that we're the sort of people that were made for
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.760]   food, and this aching and longing for something we know not what seems to
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.400]   point to the fact we were made for something else, and yes, this longing and
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.520]   desiring and yearning will only be satisfied by God." I think Paul would say
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   all that, I think he would agree with all of that, but then he would say, "No, our
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:50.520]   longings and desires and yearnings are not for God in this sense, that is, we do
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.080]   not want the true God. We don't want the true God. We don't like the true God. We
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.520]   don't admire the true God. We don't respect the true God. We don't trust the
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.200]   true God. We don't delight in the true God. Our longings are for what we think
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.680]   this God might be or should be or could be, and that turns into rejection.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.040]   As soon as the real God begins to make himself truly known, Romans says, we
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.480]   suppress it, we hold it down unless we're born again, unless the Spirit
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.520]   gives us eyes to see that the true God is beautiful and desirable, we won't seek
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.800]   him. We'll seek and seek and seek and seek for what we know not, but we won't
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.640]   seek the true God, and to the degree that the true God starts to be visible to us,
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:48.000]   we suppress that knowledge until the Holy Spirit is at work. So, question, final
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.640]   question again. Is it right to talk about a truly spiritual longing for the true
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   God in a spiritually dead soul? No. Not if we mean that a
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.240]   spiritually dead soul can perceive the true God and want him for who he is. It
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.640]   can't. It can't see him, it can't want him, it's hostile to him, and it can't please
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.960]   God by embracing God or seeking God as the true God. The dead soul does not want
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.280]   God for who he is. The dead soul suppresses who God is and creates
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.680]   alternative gods. Yes. Thank you, Pastor John. And we're gonna break now for the
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.840]   weekend, but we return on Monday with a doozy of a question, because there is an
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.360]   important debate in the Church in recent years over whether or not the ethics of
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.280]   the New Testament are final and binding, or whether they're merely suggestive and
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.720]   set a trajectory the Church can reshape and modify over time. This is such a
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.360]   crucial topic. I'm your host Tony Rehnke. We'll see you on Monday.
