[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   - Even outside of quantum computers,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.480]   some of the theories that we've been talking about,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.320]   what's your hope, what's most promising
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.200]   to test these theories?
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.300]   What are kind of experiments we can conduct,
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.700]   whether in simulation or in the physical world,
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.320]   that would validate or disprove or expand these theories?
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.960]   - Well, I think there's two parts of that question.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.360]   One is many worlds, and the other one
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.440]   is sort of emergent space time.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.000]   For many worlds, there are experiments ongoing
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100]   to test whether or not wave functions spontaneously collapse.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.720]   And if they do, then that rules out many worlds,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.800]   and that would be falsified.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.600]   If there are hidden variables,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.480]   there's a theorem that seems to indicate
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.880]   that the predictions will always be the same,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.120]   as many worlds.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.480]   I'm a little skeptical of this theorem.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.080]   I'm not completely, I haven't internalized it.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.200]   I haven't made it in part of my intuitive
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.040]   view of the world yet.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480]   So there might be loopholes to that theorem.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.840]   I'm not sure about that.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.400]   Part of me thinks that there should be
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.760]   different experimental predictions
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.200]   if there are hidden variables, but I'm not sure.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.480]   But otherwise, it's just quantum mechanics all the way down.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.800]   And so there's this cottage industry in science journalism
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.360]   of writing breathless articles that say,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960]   quantum mechanics shown to be more astonishing
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.400]   than ever before thought, and really,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.880]   it's the same quantum mechanics we've been doing since 1926.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.840]   Whereas with the emergent space time stuff,
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.360]   we know a lot less about what the theory is.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.560]   It's in a very primitive state.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.120]   We don't even really have a safely written down,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.000]   respectable, honest theory yet.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.360]   So there could very well be experimental predictions
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.600]   we just don't know about yet.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.240]   That is one of the things that we're trying to figure out.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.320]   - But for emergent space time,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.640]   you need really big stuff, right?
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.960]   - Well, or really fast stuff, or really energetic stuff.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.800]   We don't know.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.760]   That's the thing.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.580]   So there could be violations of the speed of light
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.920]   if you have emergent space time.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.820]   Not going faster than the speed of light,
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.460]   but the speed of light could be different
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.440]   for light of different wavelengths, right?
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.300]   That would be a dramatic violation of physics as we know it,
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.960]   but it could be possible.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.880]   Or not, I mean, it's not an absolute prediction.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.040]   That's the problem.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.880]   The theories are just not well-developed enough yet to say.

[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.300]   (silence)
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.460]   (silence)

[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.100]   (silence)
