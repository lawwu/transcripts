[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380]   One of the things that I would encourage everyone to do
[00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.280]   if you go through this process yourself
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.900]   is first, go find some way to categorize
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.920]   where you spend money.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.080]   Now, if you only have a couple of credit cards,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.140]   most issuers have like an annual summary.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.160]   So you could go pull up the end of year 2024 summary
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.620]   and it usually breaks down your spending by category.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.200]   For us, we have so many cards across so many issuers
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.900]   that compiling all that data together
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.960]   would take a lot of work.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.880]   And I know for some of them, it's a PDF.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.920]   Obviously, I could probably just throw all those
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   into ChatGPT and ask a question,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.920]   which now that I'm thinking about that process
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.600]   might've been easier.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   But we also use a app called Copilot
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.880]   to do all of our budgeting.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.320]   I'm a huge fan of it.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.800]   And that makes it really easy for us to go and say,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.960]   where do we spend all our money?
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.800]   Because we categorize all our transactions.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.560]   So I can go in and say, how much did we spend on dining?
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.780]   How much did we spend on these various categories?
