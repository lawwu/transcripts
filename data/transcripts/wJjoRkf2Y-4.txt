[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.800]   All right.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.520]   Let's see here.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.560]   We've got time for one more question.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.880]   Let me do one more quick, deep work question.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.080]   This one comes from Sammy.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.960]   Sammy says, what are your tips for a mother of two
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.280]   small kids doing master's?
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.140]   Well, I mean, first of all, the fact
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.080]   that you have two small kids doing master's degrees
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.240]   tells me that you've got some pretty amazing genes.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.040]   So congratulations.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.680]   I was trying to explain to my oldest son, who's nine,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.480]   the plot of Doogie Howser, M.D., which
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280]   was a show that was popular when Jesse and I were kids.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040]   It did not compute.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.680]   He was like, wait a second.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.440]   There's so many-- and you know what?
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.480]   It didn't compute not because he couldn't understand it,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.200]   but because there are a lot of questions about Doogie Howser,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.720]   M.D. And the fact that this 12-year-old was being licensed
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.760]   to do practice clinical medicine in emergency rooms,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.720]   there's a lot of questions about that show.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.140]   But that's what I think about when
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.360]   I think about two small kids doing master's degrees.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   There was-- Jesse, there was at--
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.740]   and I don't mean to go on the side,
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.320]   but MIT had some of this stuff going on.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.480]   Like MIT CS program gets some pretty interesting, weird
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.040]   brains.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.120]   But there was a kid, when I started my PhD program,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.480]   he was another incoming computer science student.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.320]   And he was 14, maybe, 15, maybe, maybe 16,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.000]   but I think like 15 years old.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.120]   He had not only finished his undergraduate degree
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.640]   in computer science from University of Washington,
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440]   which is a great program.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.280]   He had gone and worked at Microsoft for a while
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   and was bored.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.720]   He was like, I got to go get a PhD.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.560]   So he had been in the workforce for a while
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.840]   before he came back to get his PhD.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.760]   And he was like 15 years old.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.680]   So it was a strange place.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.600]   Did you talk to him a lot?
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080]   He was a systems guy, so I didn't know him well.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.160]   And I don't think he actually stayed for his PhD.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.560]   The problem with PhD programs like at MIT
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.880]   is the entire time you're there, there's literally people--
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.680]   not literally, OK, the opposite of literally.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.720]   But there's people knocking at your doors
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.520]   with wheelbarrows full of money.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.000]   In reality, it's emails from headhunters, et cetera.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.400]   But basically, here is a wheelbarrow full of money.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.600]   If you follow me to a job.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.240]   And they pick a lot of people off.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.920]   You'll just get things from headhunters.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.120]   We will-- starting salary, $450,000.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.960]   Let's rock and roll.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.320]   Come to my quant fund or whatever.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.240]   So you lose a lot of people.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.480]   They'll get their masters along the way,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.280]   and then they're out the door.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   So it's only us suckers that actually stick it out
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.120]   all the way and become low-paid professors.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.240]   All right, Sammy, I'm sorry.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.800]   I'm completely off your question now.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   All right, I was making fun of your ambiguous wording.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.560]   Sorry about that.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.800]   So let's start this again.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.320]   Sammy says, what are your tips for a mother of two
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.640]   small kids doing masters?
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.560]   All right, it's a-- what is that, like a dangling modifier?
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.200]   It's the mother, not the children's doing the masters.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.760]   All right, we get that.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.640]   How can she find focus time in the midst
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.160]   of being a wife and a mother?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.440]   Let's get ages, nine-year-old and a three-year-old.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.240]   I have one of each and a seven-year-old in between.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.000]   So I empathize.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.520]   Sammy, two things.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.200]   One, acknowledge it's a really hard thing
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.360]   you want to do right now.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   So it's important that you don't come into this
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.520]   with the psychology of, oh, I should just
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.480]   be able to do this, no big deal.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.800]   Let's just rock and roll.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.920]   I bought a bullet journal.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.720]   We're good.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.600]   Let's just go after it.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.640]   I read Lean In.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.160]   That's really hard.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.520]   If you're-- those are hard ages.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.600]   The nine-year-old is probably in school,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.760]   but the three-year-old might not be.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.560]   So that's hard.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.160]   Acknowledge that.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   Think about it like you told people
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.840]   I'm going to run a marathon.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.080]   We're like, oh, that's so hard.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.120]   And that's how you think about it.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.040]   Don't think about this as an easy thing to do.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.720]   It's not.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.640]   So I don't want you to feel bad about this being hard.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.960]   Two, in those situations, you need to autopilot all the work.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.520]   And by autopilot, this is my terminology.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.360]   This goes way back to the early days
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.680]   of my writing on my website for students.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.480]   But autopilot schedules is where all of the work that
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.280]   needs to be done, you figure out in advance.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.560]   This is where it always gets done, when it always gets done.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.640]   You can't, in this situation, succeed by just saying,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.600]   oh, what's due tomorrow?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.960]   Oh, I got to do some readings and write a paper.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.400]   Let me go get that work done.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.240]   That barely works for 19-year-olds
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.640]   who are living in a dorm and only doing school.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.840]   It's not going to work for a mother of two children.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.760]   So you've got to just figure out,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.600]   like, this is when my reading gets done.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   All right, I dropped a three-year-old off at daycare,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.840]   and I have this two-hour window.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.600]   And that's always when I do my reading for the English class.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.880]   And Sunday afternoons is for paper writing.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.560]   So every other Sunday, I work on papers.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.960]   You really got to not be thinking at all about,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.880]   what should I be doing today?
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.000]   Autopilot that all out.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.420]   Figure out how much time you need,
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.920]   what work you have to do when it gets done.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.600]   So you can be really optimal about this
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.320]   and really be smart about where you try to fit that time.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.260]   If it still doesn't fit, which it might not,
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.560]   then you have to slow down.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.800]   You have to slow down the program.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920]   You have to find a way to do it on a longer timeline.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.520]   Face the productivity dragon.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.480]   But if the dragon is too big, don't charge into the cave.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.500]   That's a great thing about autopilot scheduling
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.560]   is you get to stare it in the face and say,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.940]   can I make this work?
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.520]   And if you can, this autopilot schedule
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.600]   is going to give you the best possible chance
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.440]   of making it work.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.760]   And if you can't, you say, okay, what can I make work?
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.820]   And you adjust what you're doing until it fits.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.380]   (upbeat music)
