[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.060]   Pastor John, we have a question from a 17-year-old young man in London who writes, "I have been
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.720]   in bondage to pornography for a few years now.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.940]   How do I even begin to break free from this?"
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.100]   Speak to this young man who feels the bondage of pornography and who has been struggling
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100]   with this for years.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.100]   So what would you say to him?
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.260]   Well, what I say particularly to any given young man or woman, and I think the women
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.780]   who listen to this shouldn't think, and I'm sure if they're listening, they don't think
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.500]   that this is just a male issue.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.700]   Increasingly, women are entangled sometimes for different kinds of reasons than men in
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.700]   pornography.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.820]   So I don't want to think just men here, although that's usually the way we're thinking about
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.980]   it.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.540]   Whether I speak to a man or a woman in a certain way is going to depend on what I know about
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.620]   them, whether they're a believer, whether they're walking with the Lord, whether they're
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.180]   really fighting in biblical ways.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.420]   So I'm just going to assume as I answer this that the person I'm talking to is a Christian
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.860]   and trusts Jesus and believes the Bible.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.060]   And here are just things that that young man might consider.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:35.900]   Number one, getting right with God precedes getting our pornography issues fixed.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.500]   That is, justification precedes and is the foundation for sanctification.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.580]   The only sin that we can defeat is a forgiven sin.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.060]   That's the way I like to say it.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.500]   So that if you get that backward and start saying, "Okay, I've got to fix this sin.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.980]   I've got to kill this sin or I can't get right with God."
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.420]   That's backwards and that's the opposite of Christianity.
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.820]   Christ died and justifies, died for and justifies the ungodly.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.100]   And therefore we start there.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.020]   So I'd want to encourage them, trust him, trust him for his cleansing and his forgiveness
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900]   on the basis of faith alone.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.740]   The second thing I would say is that great things are at stake here.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.460]   I wouldn't play fast and loose.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.540]   I'd say if your eye offends you, tear it out and throw it away.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.220]   Better to go to heaven with one eye than to hell with two eyes.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.180]   In other words, we're dealing with really serious issues here, Jesus said.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.900]   Number three, I would plead with that person that they're going to lose their enjoyment
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.980]   of God if they continually prefer the enjoyment of nudity or something like that.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.420]   Because Jesus said, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.100]   I know in my own experience, the times when I give way to any kind of sensuality, my capacities
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.540]   for spiritual delight in God diminishes.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.260]   And I know that the trade-off is always lousy.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.780]   So for the sake of greater joy and greater pleasure, we fight against temptation.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:33.660]   And the fourth thing I would say, from 1 Thessalonians 4, I think verse 4 or 5, it says, "Control
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:42.220]   your body and treat your wife not in passion, as the Gentiles who do not know God."
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.460]   The implication of that statement, in passions like the Gentiles who do not know God, is
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.460]   that knowing God has a powerful effect on subduing passions.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.660]   Here's what I say, I've actually said this to a bunch of guys.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.500]   When they have been working at this for a long time, I say, "You know, I don't really
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.260]   know how deep or strong your knowledge of God is."
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.460]   So here's my assignment to you to help you overcome pornography.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.920]   Get a copy of Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology, it's only about 1,100 pages, and read it cover
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.900]   to cover over the next six months.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.460]   And then come and we'll talk again about your problem with pornography.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:37.300]   Because here's what I'm thinking, I think Satan is bringing his attacks against us,
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.180]   and we're using our little pea-shooter, Sunday School level knowledge of God to try to defeat
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.180]   him.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.380]   And there's such vast, deep, glorious, beautiful, strong, wonderful things about God that when
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:02.660]   you're grasped by them, it just has an indirect, powerful effect on making sensuality less
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.340]   of a power in your life.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.700]   So it's kind of an indirect way of undermining the powerful effects of sexual temptation.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.220]   Practically, I'd say get a copy, you can even get it online, of John Owen's Mortification
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.220]   of Sin.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.860]   It's an 80-page old book that teaches us how to fight sin.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:34.380]   My book, Future Grace, has a chapter in it on lust and how I go about fighting it.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.980]   Online at Desiring God, we've got this little thing I wrote called Anthem, A-N-T-H-E-M.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:52.220]   A, avoid, N, say no, T, turn your mind and heart, H, hold a beautiful vision of Jesus
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:00.700]   in your mind until it triumphs over the other sensual vision, E, enjoy, M, move on.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.540]   I unpack each of those as really practical steps.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.380]   I wrote that, not out of some theoretical view of how to fight temptation, I wrote about
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.740]   it because in the backyard one day, I was pushing my lawnmower and my wife had just
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   told me the night before that she saw some people doing some sexual hanky-panky out behind
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.900]   our garage and I passed the place in pushing my lawnmower where they were and my mind immediately
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.660]   created that scene and became lustful at that moment.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.540]   I had to fight back and forth as I was pushing the lawnmower.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.740]   I'm fighting to get this thing out of my head.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.900]   I've tasted what these guys are dealing with and so we're in this together and those are
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.940]   my best efforts so far to try to put forward concrete, practical, biblical steps to defeat
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.940]   this monster.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.340]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those principles for fighting pornography, and thank you for
