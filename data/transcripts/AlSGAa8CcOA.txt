[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.260]   "Well, Dr. Oppenheimer, if you'd had a hydrogen bomb for Hiroshima, well, wouldn't you have used it?"
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.740]   And Oppenheimer said, "No."
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.280]   The interrogator said, "Why is that?"
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.720]   He said, "Because the target was too small."
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.020]   So, after the war, when our bomb planners went into Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:33.200]   those two cities didn't look that different from the other cities that had been firebombed with ordinary high explosives.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.800]   They went home with the thought that, "Ah, these bombs are not so destructive after all."
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.280]   They had been touted as city busters, and they weren't.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.780]   They were not certainly more destructive than the firebombing campaign,
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.540]   when everything of more than 50,000 population had already been destroyed.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.860]   That, in turn, influenced the judgment about what we needed to do vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.
