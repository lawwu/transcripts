[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.420]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.620]   I'm pleased to announce that my new book,
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.080]   which I've been working on for more than five years,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.800]   is now available for pre-sale purchase.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.860]   The book is entitled "Protocols,
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.360]   "An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.880]   And within the book, you can find, as the name suggests,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.740]   protocols for everything from how to improve
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.760]   and even optimize your sleep,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.560]   for increasing your motivation and focus,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.700]   for nutrition, that is specific nutritional guidelines
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.600]   to follow for health and performance,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.200]   as well as exercise, stress control,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.920]   your oral and gut microbiome,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.720]   both of which are critical for brain and body health,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.480]   as well as protocols for creativity, and much more.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.680]   Within the book, you'll also find the scientific basis,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.960]   that is the mechanisms and specific studies
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.040]   that substantiate these protocols.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.120]   And the book is designed to be incredibly easy to use,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.400]   such that if you're suffering
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.420]   from a particular pain point in life,
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.040]   such as difficulty sleeping or excess stress,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.840]   or any number of different issues,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.600]   that you can go to a specific chapter in protocol
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.640]   and begin to resolve that issue.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.880]   So my goal in writing this book
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.360]   is that it not only be exceptionally practical,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.840]   but that it also be extremely informative,
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   that is teaching you a lot about the science
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.500]   that underlies the protocols that can improve
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.060]   your mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.520]   To order protocols, go to protocolsbook.com,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.840]   and there you will find links
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.160]   to any number of different vendors,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.320]   and you can select the one that you prefer.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.680]   Again, that's protocolsbook.com.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920]   My guest for today's episode is Dr. Gabrielle Lyon.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.000]   Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is a medical doctor
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.840]   who did her clinical and research training
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.280]   at Washington University in St. Louis.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120]   She's an expert in geriatrics, in nutrition,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.920]   in health, and longevity.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.120]   And during today's episode, Dr. Lyon explains
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.540]   how if we are interested in our immediate
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.000]   and long-term health,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.120]   muscle is the organ that we need to pay attention to.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.380]   She explains how this is true for everybody,
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.080]   men and women alike,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.400]   and that there are specific things
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.520]   that we all can and should do with our nutrition
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   and our exercise in order to maximize the health
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.200]   of our muscular tissue.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   Now, in some cases, people will be interested
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.880]   in building more muscle,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.860]   but it's important to point out
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.440]   that much of today's discussion
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.280]   is simply about improving the health
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.520]   of your muscular tissue
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   and the specific ways to do that
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.440]   in order to support brain health,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.520]   body health and movement, of course,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.400]   as well as the health of every organ system in your body.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300]   Again, placing a focus on improving muscular tissue itself
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.200]   as a way to improve all the organ and tissue systems
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   of your body.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.560]   Dr. Lyon explains the specific science and protocols
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.540]   that can be applied in your everyday life
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.400]   at the level of what you choose to eat or not eat,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.920]   as well as how much of certain foods to eat or avoid,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.880]   as well as specific training regimens,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.920]   most of which take very little time,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.680]   but they can vastly improve the health
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.720]   of your muscular tissue
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.760]   and therefore the health of your entire brain and body.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.640]   I'm certain that by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.120]   you will have a much more thorough understanding
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   of what you can do to improve your immediate
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.360]   and long-term health
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.920]   and thereby potentially your lifespan,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.160]   all of which are based on the most modern understanding
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.760]   from basic research, from clinical studies,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.960]   and from practical application in the real world.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.760]   Before you begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.200]   that this podcast is separate
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.440]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.640]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920]   to the general public.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.360]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.760]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.320]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.040]   and with several expert guests on this podcast
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.900]   about the fact that most of us should be seeking
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.840]   to get about one gram of high-quality protein
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.360]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.860]   Not only does that protein provide critical building blocks
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.000]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.400]   but also for overall metabolism and health.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high-quality protein
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.360]   per calorie ratio so that you can get that one gram
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.840]   of protein per pound of body weight easily
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.420]   and without ingesting an excess of calories.
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.080]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   I love their venison steaks, their ground venison,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.800]   I love their bone broths, and I love their jerky,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.860]   which is extremely convenient when you're traveling.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.680]   Those Maui Nui Venison jerky sticks have 10 grams
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.660]   of high-quality protein per stick at just 55 calories.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.260]   While Maui Nui offers the highest quality meat available,
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.920]   their supplies are limited.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.480]   Responsible management of the Axis deer population
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.880]   on the island of Maui means that they will not go
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.480]   beyond harvest capacity.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.400]   So signing up for a membership is the best way
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.760]   to ensure access to their high-quality meat.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.920]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.560]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   to get 20% off your membership or first order.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.960]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.880]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.480]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.240]   and activities affect your health
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.400]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.640]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.720]   One of the most important factors in both your short
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.880]   and long-term health is your body's ability
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.040]   to manage glucose, or what's sometimes called blood sugar.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.180]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.200]   you want to keep your blood glucose steady
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.580]   without big spikes or crashes.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.640]   I started using Levels about three years ago
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.360]   as a way to understand how different foods
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.320]   and activities impacted my blood glucose levels.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.780]   And it's proven incredibly informative for me
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.100]   in determining what food choices I make,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.120]   when to eat, and when to time eating relative to workouts,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.460]   sleep, et cetera.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.600]   Indeed, using Levels has made it very easy for me
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.400]   to optimize my entire schedule
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.720]   and to understand where the flexibility
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.560]   in that schedule exists, so that if I need to move a meal
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.360]   or I need to fast a little bit longer,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.800]   or if I need to work out fasted or not fasted,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.500]   all of that can be adjusted while maintaining energy
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.000]   and focus and great sleep at night.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.860]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.600]   and trying a CGM yourself,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.700]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.560]   Levels just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.220]   and it has even better tracking than the previous version.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.260]   Right now, they're also offering an additional
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.000]   two free months of membership.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Again, that's levels.link/huberman
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.980]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.900]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.780]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.720]   Now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.700]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.280]   Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.940]   is to make sure that you sleep on a mattress
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.220]   designed specifically for your sleep needs.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.880]   And that's what Helix Sleep mattresses
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.300]   are designed to accomplish.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.860]   If you go to the Helix website
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.620]   and take a brief two minute quiz,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.960]   it asks you questions such as, do you sleep on your back,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.140]   your side or your stomach?
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.180]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.700]   Maybe you know, maybe you don't know the answers
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.740]   to those questions.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.580]   In any case, they'll match you to the ideal mattress
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.260]   for your unique sleep needs.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.360]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk Helix mattress.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.920]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.300]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.620]   and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.180]   because it's customized to my unique sleep needs.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.460]   If you'd like to try Helix,
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.660]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.180]   take that two minute sleep quiz,
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.000]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.380]   that's ideal for your unique sleep needs.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.140]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 30% off mattresses
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.540]   and two free pillows.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.460]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.300]   to get 30% off and two free pillows.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.580]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Gabrielle Lyon.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.020]   Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, welcome.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.980]   - Thank you so much.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.500]   - So great to have you here.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.460]   You have a tremendous range and depth of expertise.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.260]   You treat men, you treat women.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.920]   You know a ton about exercise, physiology, nutrition.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.740]   You've done work in psychiatry.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.820]   You've done work in geriatrics.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.860]   You know so very much about how to get healthy
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.020]   and stay healthy.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.620]   And today we're gonna talk about all of that.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.460]   To kick things off,
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.380]   I would love to dive into your take
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.220]   on this unique aspect of our physiology
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.220]   that most people, when they hear about,
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.020]   think about weight training or maybe bodybuilding
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.780]   or have some immediate reaction to,
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.540]   but you have a different stance
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.820]   on this incredible organ that we call muscle.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.100]   So if you would just tell us
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.940]   how you look at this thing that we call muscle.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.140]   In men, in women, in kids, in old people, young people,
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.060]   how should we think about muscle?
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.180]   - Well, first of all, muscle is the organ of longevity.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.380]   And we've always thought about muscle,
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.140]   just as you said, when it comes to exercise,
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.060]   performance, mobility, and strength,
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.900]   which by the way,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.180]   all of those things are important and critical for life.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.020]   But there's something very unique
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.660]   and special to skeletal muscle.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.900]   First of all, it's an organ system.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.620]   It's an endocrine organ.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.860]   It is responsible for a large component of glucose disposal,
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.980]   roughly 80% of glucose disposal.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.740]   And we all hear about these things
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.840]   like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.500]   Largely, many of these metabolic diseases
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.860]   begin in skeletal muscle, decades before.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.060]   - Interesting.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.140]   - Skeletal muscle is also an amino acid reservoir.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.540]   It is the place that your body pulls from amino acids.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.420]   And that is something that changes as we age,
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.060]   this idea of protein turnover,
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.860]   and we require healthy skeletal muscle.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.020]   Of course, it's the body armor that we all know,
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.980]   and it is really responsible for how we age.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.220]   And by the way, I came to this understanding
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.460]   through an experience I'd love to share with you.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.740]   I did my fellowship in geriatrics and nutritional sciences.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.140]   And at the time, we were looking at,
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.420]   every fellow has to have a project, lucky for us.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.140]   And we were looking at body composition and brain function.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.940]   And there was one patient who I just adored.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.100]   She was a mom of three kids,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.920]   and she had always yo-yo dieted.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.180]   We imaged her brain,
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.020]   and her brain looked like the beginning
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.180]   of an Alzheimer's brain.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.060]   And I thought to myself, and I felt very responsible,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.260]   thinking, why was this woman who was doing everything
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.340]   that we told her to do, she was exercising,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.180]   she was eating a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet,
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.240]   why was she so metabolically unhealthy?
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.340]   And I realized that at the end of the day,
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.220]   it wasn't that she was over fat,
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.020]   it was that she was under-muscled.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.660]   And we spend decades, and have spent decades,
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.720]   trying to treat obesity,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.340]   when really what we need to be looking at
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.420]   is skeletal muscle.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.460]   - Super interesting.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.460]   We know that the brain is among
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.220]   the most metabolically active organs in the body,
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.460]   and muscle too,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.580]   one of the most metabolically active organs in the body.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.660]   You'll probably tell me that one is more active
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.500]   than the other.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.320]   Which one is it?
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.380]   - Muscle's actually, quite frankly,
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.000]   not very metabolically active at rest.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.840]   - Interesting.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.500]   - For every pound of skeletal muscle,
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.040]   it might at rest burn 10 calories.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.020]   Primarily burns fatty acids at rest.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.380]   - Okay, I learned something new,
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.760]   and I imagine many other people did as well.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.780]   So this woman that was overweight,
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.100]   you looked at the problem through a different lens,
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.440]   that she's under-muscled.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.200]   How does one go from being under-muscled
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.460]   to properly muscled?
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.660]   And what is that?
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.560]   And as I say this,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.020]   I realized that many of our listeners
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.560]   probably don't resistance train.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.980]   Or if they do,
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.060]   they may not want to carry a lot of muscle,
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.520]   thinking that that would make them
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.220]   have to buy a new wardrobe.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.420]   Certainly some of our listenership
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.740]   probably wants to gain more muscle,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.700]   but is-
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.540]   - Or a new wardrobe, I'm sure.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.380]   - Or a new wardrobe.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.280]   Is there a way to view increasing muscle mass
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.140]   in a way that is compatible with kind of,
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.860]   I don't know, like traditional aesthetics
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.700]   or with overall health
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.940]   in a way that's sort of distinct
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.540]   from quote-unquote bodybuilding?
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.660]   I mean, again, as soon as we talk about muscle,
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.340]   we think about slabs of meat
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.800]   added to different parts of our body.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.900]   And surely certain people probably want to add muscle
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.720]   to certain parts of their body for aesthetic reasons.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.040]   But how should we think about muscle
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.160]   in the context of some of the to-dos
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.640]   in terms of nutrition and exercise?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.000]   And we'll segue into that.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.180]   Again, how should we conceptualize this business
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.680]   of being under-muscled and getting to,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.720]   I guess what we call appropriately muscled?
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   - I think that it's a really good point,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.520]   this idea of being appropriately muscled.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.920]   So the truth is I can't tell you
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.880]   how much skeletal muscle mass you should have
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.560]   for optimal health.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.320]   I don't know how much skeletal muscle mass
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.960]   I should have for optimal health.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.220]   We haven't done a good job in the literature
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.960]   and just as a population being able to track skeletal muscle
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.680]   and know what is optimal.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.920]   We are really good at looking at body fat
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.140]   and we're really good at looking at bone.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.220]   But when it comes to skeletal muscle,
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.400]   DEXA is an extrapolation.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.920]   So for example, we use DEXA as the gold standard.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.320]   And I'm gonna come back to what we need to do
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.520]   to gain healthy skeletal muscle.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.120]   But I think that it's really important
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.920]   to put things into perspective
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.160]   and a framework for how we think about things.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.800]   We traditionally use DEXA.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.040]   DEXA looks at bone
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.680]   and it looks at lean tissue collectively.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.780]   Part of lean tissue is skeletal muscle mass.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.280]   It doesn't determine the health of skeletal muscle mass.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.480]   It doesn't determine anything
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.520]   about the quality of that tissue.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.720]   It purely looks at lean tissue,
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.960]   which then we determine part of that lean tissue,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   maybe it's 40% is skeletal muscle.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.680]   And that's important to understand
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.140]   as we begin to frame up the conversation
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.720]   as how much skeletal muscle should I have?
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.240]   I have no idea.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.740]   But what I can tell you
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.000]   is that if I were to look at your blood work
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.260]   and I saw something like elevated triglycerides
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.160]   or elevated insulin or elevated glucose,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.800]   I would begin to understand
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.840]   that the health of your skeletal muscle
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.720]   isn't where it should be.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.680]   And by the way, the health of skeletal muscle mass
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.920]   begins when we're young.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.320]   This idea of sarcopenia,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.160]   which for the listener or the viewer,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.200]   the definition of sarcopenia,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.080]   by the way, became a disease.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.280]   It wasn't even classified as a disease till 2016.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.120]   - Wow.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.320]   - Yes, wow, which is very recent for a disease.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.780]   It is a decrease in muscle mass and function.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.600]   But interestingly, we don't necessarily know
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.560]   what one should have.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.280]   So I think it's important to understand
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.900]   that when we're talking about the health of skeletal muscle,
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.000]   we're still pretty much in the infancy
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.080]   of understanding the trajectory
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.480]   of where it is and where it's going.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.160]   So when we think about how we maintain
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.480]   the health of skeletal muscle,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.080]   one of the things that I didn't mention
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.040]   is that skeletal muscle is a nutrient-sensing organ.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.840]   It is uniquely sensitive to the quality of our diet.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.160]   The quality of our diet defined as the quality
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.480]   of the amino acids that we're gaining.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.720]   And that would be, for the listener, dietary protein.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.800]   Skeletal muscle is sensitive
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.120]   to one of the amino acids, leucine.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.480]   And depending on the quality of the diet,
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.000]   meaning how much leucine that you're getting
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.680]   in any given meal, will then stimulate muscle health.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   - Not just muscle size, but muscle health.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.600]   - Muscle health.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.880]   And the way that we think about muscle health is by proxy,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.400]   is this concept called muscle protein synthesis,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.820]   which we can measure.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.620]   And when we get a dietary protein amount,
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.200]   which is between 30 and 50 grams of high-quality protein,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.760]   it stimulates skeletal muscle.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.240]   - So I love this idea of focusing for a bit
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.520]   on muscle protein health,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.620]   because it divorces us from this conversation,
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.440]   at least temporarily, about muscle size,
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.800]   which I have to imagine is correlated,
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.840]   but it's a separate thing altogether.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.120]   Actually, I should just ask the question,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.900]   is it possible for somebody to have a lot of muscle,
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.320]   but their muscle health is poor?
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.240]   - Yes.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.920]   - Okay, conversely, can somebody have a moderate
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.480]   to low amount of muscle, but their muscle quality is high,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.040]   or is that less common?
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.480]   - Well, the first thing that you said
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.640]   is absolutely something that we see,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.560]   is that in an individual that carries a lot of muscle
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.720]   and say they're inactive,
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.440]   there is a big discussion about how heavy individuals
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.200]   will have more muscle mass.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.400]   But what we have to recognize
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.320]   is the health of that skeletal muscle is fat deposition
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.040]   can be visceral fat deposition, fat around the organs,
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.360]   and it can be also fat infiltrate into the tissue,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.600]   like, not to gross anyone out, a marbled steak.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.120]   And that's exactly what can happen
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.360]   to unhealthy skeletal muscle,
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.060]   which then affects its ability to contract,
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.200]   which also affects,
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.080]   there's a ton of mitochondria in skeletal muscle.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.680]   It affects the efficiency of skeletal muscle.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.760]   So yes, someone can have potentially more muscle,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.680]   but more unhealthy muscle.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.520]   - Interesting, when you say a marbled steak,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.760]   I think at the extreme, like a Wagyu, a raw Wagyu,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.440]   it looks like there's as much white fat in it
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.700]   as there is red meat in it.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.320]   And it's a very different taste and texture.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.560]   So that's what we're talking about.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.520]   My understanding is those cows don't move around much.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.760]   They're somewhat sedentary compared to say,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.200]   a free range grass eating cow.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.040]   Is that right? - Yeah.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.480]   - Okay. - That's absolutely correct.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.800]   - Okay, so we want quality, healthy muscle,
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.120]   and then we can talk about muscle amount.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.840]   - And then the other thing that I'll say about it
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.520]   is part of what defines muscle health
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.060]   is that flux, that movement.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.240]   So if you were to think about skeletal muscle
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.680]   like a suitcase and an individual was say,
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.420]   going on a trip for four days,
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.300]   but chooses to eat or pack for 30 days.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.500]   - We know these people. - Yes, I know.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.500]   I may be one of them.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.740]   I have my suitcase here.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.780]   I was only coming in for a day,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.100]   but I may have packed for four days.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.660]   Not sure what I was doing, but that's besides the point.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.340]   When an individual is overeating calories,
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.180]   overeating carbohydrates,
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.200]   I had mentioned earlier that skeletal muscle,
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.020]   one of its primary roles is glucose disposal.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.860]   And I'm sure we're gonna get
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.660]   in the mechanisms of glucose disposal,
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.380]   whether it's insulin dependent or insulin independent,
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.780]   depending on if someone is moving
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.460]   or contracting that muscle.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.740]   When an individual is eating food, carbohydrates,
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.620]   it gets stored in skeletal muscle as glycogen,
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.740]   because as we know,
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.980]   glucose at a high level is toxic to the body.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.880]   So the body must move glucose out of the bloodstream
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.700]   into the cells.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   Now, what happens is there becomes this stasis.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.540]   So if an individual is inactive and not exercising,
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.540]   then that skeletal muscle becomes overpacked.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.900]   Skeletal muscle at rest burns primarily free fatty acids,
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.860]   which is interesting.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.620]   Most people think about skeletal muscle
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.340]   as burning carbohydrates,
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.460]   but actually at rest, skeletal muscle burns fatty acids.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.100]   As you can imagine, when that muscle is full
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.940]   and you are not exercising it,
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.980]   then the substrates have nowhere to go
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.820]   and it remains in the bloodstream.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.140]   And that would be a sign of unhealthy skeletal muscle,
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.100]   which then loops back to what you see in blood work.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.620]   - Elevated insulin, elevated blood glucose.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.060]   - Elevated free fatty acids,
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.420]   elevated branched chain amino acids,
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.740]   all of these things, which again,
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.580]   as skeletal muscle, as the metabolic sink,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.140]   have nowhere to go.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.620]   - So I'm starting to get a picture
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.380]   where in order to have healthy muscle,
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.460]   we need to think about the feeding of that muscle,
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.820]   the providing of nutrients to that muscle, that is,
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.420]   as well as the use of that muscle.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.540]   Let's start with the feeding
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.140]   or the providing of nutrients to that muscle.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.380]   You mentioned that muscle at rest mainly burns fatty acids.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.980]   It can store glycogen.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.820]   How do we know when a muscle is full of glycogen?
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.620]   I mean, there's the visual representation
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.660]   of the muscle seems fuller as opposed to flatter,
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.300]   but these are not specific
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.380]   or these are not precise terms.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.940]   How much carbohydrate does it take
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.940]   to fill all the muscle of the body with glycogen?
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.900]   And then what sorts of things perhaps deplete that?
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.900]   - I think it's a great question.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.020]   We know that when we're talking about glycogen,
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.540]   the liver stores glycogen, maybe a hundred grams,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.060]   and then skeletal muscle, depending on your size,
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.020]   for example, you might store much more muscle glycogen,
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.580]   whether it's four or 500 grams
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.820]   compared to someone who is my size.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.580]   - And can we do the standard conversion
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.820]   of four calories per gram?
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.020]   So if the liver is 400 grams,
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.340]   we just say, okay, there's about 1,600 calories worth
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.340]   of energy there.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.380]   So if I go out and I do some exercise
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.140]   and burn 1,600 calories over time,
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.460]   does that mean that the liver is then completely depleted?
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.340]   - So, well, the liver will deplete
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.260]   through an overnight fast.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.980]   So the liver maintains blood glucose.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.100]   So skeletal muscle doesn't maintain blood glucose directly.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.620]   The way that you would leverage muscle glycogen
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.620]   would be through exercise.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.580]   The way in which you would deplete muscle glycogen
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.060]   would be through more intensive exercise.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.720]   And when you think about the foods
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.020]   and the way in which, you know,
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.340]   your original question is how would we know
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.060]   how much muscle glycogen or how much we need to refuel?
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.620]   I typically think about it as overall activity levels.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.220]   So if someone is sedentary,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.180]   then the current recommendation for carbohydrates
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.780]   would be 130 grams per day.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.020]   - At four calories per gram.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.380]   - At four calories per gram.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.020]   - And is that both simple and complex carbohydrates,
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.940]   fibrous carbohydrates?
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.020]   - Yes, it would just be overall.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.220]   - 130 grams, if they're completely sedentary.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.060]   - Yes.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.060]   - So just a little bit of walking,
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.580]   getting up, going to the computer,
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.340]   to the bathroom, to the car, et cetera,
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.300]   but basically sedentary.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.620]   - Yes, and the average American
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.860]   takes in 300 grams of carbohydrates a day.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.980]   So more than double.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.980]   And as you can imagine, this can distort metabolism.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.020]   When we think about glucose disposal,
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.020]   the way in which I think about glucose disposal,
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.500]   if an individual is sedentary,
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.980]   is thinking about how many carbohydrates
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.900]   an individual can ingest at one time
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.060]   that would mitigate insulin response
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.060]   and would be able to be disposed of safely.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.780]   And that number is between 40 and 50 grams
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.380]   of carbohydrates at a meal outside of exercise.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.700]   The rest of carbohydrates would be earned through exercise.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.180]   And through every hour of exercise,
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.140]   depending on the intensity,
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.700]   that could be between 40 to 70 grams,
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.860]   depending on how intense an individual exercises.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.340]   And that would be safely disposed of in a two-hour period.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.620]   I mean, when you think about an oral glucose tolerance test,
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.540]   that's a 75-gram load.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.620]   You assume within two hours
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.300]   that that blood sugar regulation
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   should come back to a normal range.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.820]   - So at 40 to 50 grams of carbohydrate every two hours,
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.420]   does that mean that if somebody were to eat
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.220]   40 to 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours-
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.060]   - Which they shouldn't.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.260]   - Which they shouldn't, right.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.180]   But because you're gonna quickly exceed
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.100]   that 130 grams per day.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.780]   And even if exercising with resistance training,
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.540]   say hard for an hour,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.220]   which can afford somebody maybe, what,
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.460]   another couple hundred, 300 grams of carbohydrates?
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.580]   - Probably not that much.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.420]   - Okay.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.900]   So I think that if people care about body composition,
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.700]   which I would say everyone should,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.180]   because you want to have an appropriate level of body fat
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.180]   and healthy skeletal muscle,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.900]   then you wouldn't necessarily,
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.980]   unless you're doing some kind of cardiovascular activity,
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.940]   you're not using a ton of muscle glycogen,
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.020]   depending on how much you're training.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.580]   - And how much glycogen is the brain using?
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.100]   - So that is a good question.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.420]   The brain uses a lot of carbohydrates.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.660]   That would be a primary source.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.540]   When they come up with the numbers of 130,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.300]   it's really based on brain and then the rest of the body.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.420]   - Can we safely say that for somebody that's thinking a lot,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.860]   they need more carbohydrates?
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.900]   - You could say that.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.860]   Then your brain, yes,
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.940]   your brain is very metabolically active.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.980]   - Interesting.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.740]   So we're gonna drawing rough estimates,
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.620]   not knowing people's body weight,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.920]   not knowing their body composition,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.300]   but what I'm arriving at here is,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.260]   if somebody does a little bit of cardiovascular training,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.260]   maybe a little bit of light resistance training,
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.820]   I'm describing the activities of many people out there,
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.020]   maybe 250 grams of carbohydrates,
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.500]   you're kind of at the threshold.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.420]   - That's a lot.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.060]   - That's a lot for calories per gram of those carbohydrates.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.720]   And so let's say 200 grams of carbohydrates per day,
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.100]   but that's not a ton of calories overall.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.060]   So what should the remainder of the calories be made up of?
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.340]   - So, I think what we're really talking about here
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.140]   is how do we design a nutrition plan
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.780]   for people to have healthy skeletal muscle?
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.700]   And if I were to say, okay,
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.140]   what are we thinking about for the listener
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.940]   or for the people out there?
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.140]   They're thinking,
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.240]   I really wanna have a healthy body composition
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.060]   and healthy skeletal muscle mass.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.040]   The way in which they would do that is,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.180]   number one, you have to prioritize dietary protein.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.220]   So we're talking about carbohydrates here,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.580]   but carbohydrates shouldn't be the primary focus.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.020]   Nobody has challenges getting carbohydrates in.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.420]   130 grams would be a safe recommendation
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.320]   if someone is overweight or struggles with type two diabetes
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.060]   or any of these other metabolic conditions,
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.260]   there is evidence to support a lower carbohydrate intake.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:04.140]   - I mean, 130 grams is one little micro packet of pretzels
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.360]   on an airplane ride, you know?
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.840]   - That actually has probably closer
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.080]   to 37 grams of carbohydrates.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.920]   - Okay, good.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.400]   - Not that I had a pretzel packet before
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.640]   or threw one at Rob on the way in, but no.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.840]   - Right, okay, so I'm way off there.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.440]   So they have one of those, a bagel in the morning
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.360]   and they shouldn't, but they do.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.440]   And then they have some pasta at dinner.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.840]   And so most people are probably exceeding
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.240]   that 130 grams by a huge margin.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.300]   - Yes, they are.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.880]   And there's a couple of things there
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.620]   that it's really important that you said,
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.780]   is that individuals, when we're thinking about designing
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.260]   a plan for skeletal muscle health,
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.780]   that first meal is most important.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.740]   That first meal of the day, having dietary protein,
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.380]   will set you up metabolically for the rest of the day.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.740]   - And when you say first meal,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.840]   and we'll talk a little bit later
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.980]   about intermittent fasting.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.660]   And I, for instance, eat my first meal at usually 11 a.m.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.740]   It's just kind of how I'm wired.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.380]   I've never wanted to eat breakfast first thing.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.320]   I've forced myself to eat some eggs first thing
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.680]   in the morning from time to time and it felt fine.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.040]   But do you recommend that people eat a true breakfast,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.760]   like within a certain number of hours of waking up
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.600]   for sake of muscle health and metabolic health?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.560]   - When we think about that first meal,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.520]   I frankly don't care when you have it.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.080]   One also has to understand
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.440]   that you're coming out of an overnight fast.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.280]   If you are young and healthy,
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.200]   then the timing of that first meal likely doesn't matter.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.640]   Because you are robust,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.480]   your body is very efficient and capable
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   to withstand protein degradation.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.980]   It's able to withstand protein degradation
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.820]   and protein turnover, which is ultimately why we're eating.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.140]   So that's one reason why we're eating.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.460]   And we'll talk a little bit more about that.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.180]   That first meal of the day, if you are young and healthy,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.860]   the timing doesn't really matter.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.460]   And I would say when it begins to matter
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.740]   is when you're older.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.740]   When you are in your 60s,
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.500]   fat continuing to fast may be a negative,
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.580]   negative for muscle health.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.180]   That first meal of the day is important
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.180]   because we know that when you get
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.020]   between 40 and 50 grams of protein,
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.720]   that first meal of the day,
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.180]   you stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.340]   Muscle protein synthesis is by proxy
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.780]   what we use to measure
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.040]   as a marker for overall muscle health.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.980]   Now there's a lot of history here
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.180]   when we think about designing a meal plan.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.360]   That first meal has between,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   we'll say give it between 30 to 50 grams of dietary protein.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.960]   That will do a number of things.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.260]   Number one, it will stimulate skeletal muscle,
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.740]   what we would consider the health of skeletal muscle.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.540]   It also will affect the brain.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.140]   It'll improve satiation.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.780]   You and I were talking previously.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:57.420]   It releases a handful of gut peptides.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.460]   - Like glucagon-like peptide one,
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.280]   which later we'll talk about. - GLP, yes, GLP.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.100]   - Ozempic mongero, but yeah. - CCK, PYY,
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   things that will affect appetite for that second meal.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.420]   And there's some very interesting research
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.620]   out of Heather Leidy's lab.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.600]   And basically, when she put individuals,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   younger adolescents, on a meal of 30 to 40 grams of protein,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.860]   they were much less likely to choose, say, donuts
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.900]   or something outside of what we would consider
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.620]   a healthy nutrition plan.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.140]   - Later in the day or in the same meal?
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.180]   - Later in the day.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.220]   So it was essentially augmenting their willpower.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.980]   - Okay, so it sounds like for young people,
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.580]   they can delay breakfast if they want.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.940]   For older people, probably not.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.340]   But that the first meal of the day should include
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.860]   what you're calling dietary protein, 30 to 50 grams.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.420]   And maybe we should talk about the quality of that protein.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.860]   Because I think a lot of people understand
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.880]   that there are meat proteins, there are plant proteins.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.320]   How important is the quality of that protein?
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.360]   - This tends to be a hot topic
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.840]   and somewhat very controversial.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.520]   - Great. - Great for you.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.680]   - I know, great for everybody.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.800]   I mean, controversy on this podcast
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.280]   is embraced in the following way.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.400]   We state what we know, we state what we don't know,
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.680]   and we are always happy to return to the conversation
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.960]   at a future time to adjust any stances based on the data
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.780]   and how we evolve as people.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.700]   - Okay, well, I love that.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.960]   Dietary protein, we speak about it as if it's one thing.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.520]   But actually, it's 20 different amino acids,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.240]   nine of which are essential,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.600]   the rest we can generate in our body.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.880]   And when we think about skeletal muscle,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.900]   we think about the essential amino acids.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.880]   And the essential amino acids,
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.200]   primarily for skeletal muscle health,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.000]   are the branch chain amino acids,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.680]   leucine being one of those.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.700]   So leucine is uniquely stimulating to skeletal muscle.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.020]   And when you have enough leucine,
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.900]   it triggers muscle protein synthesis.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.580]   - And when you say stimulating and muscle protein synthesis,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.740]   I think a lot of people get a picture
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.580]   in their mind of a muscle growing.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.840]   But you're not necessarily talking about that.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.140]   You're talking about the organ that is muscle,
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.620]   that it's health, it's metabolism being cultivated
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.940]   so that it can do all the hormone endocrine related things
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.540]   and the glucose disposal related things
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.200]   that we'll get into in a bit more detail later.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.040]   Is that right?
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.860]   - Yeah.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.960]   And so when you have a breakfast of 30 to 50 grams,
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.320]   you appropriately stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.120]   And one has to recognize
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.000]   that if you eat below that threshold,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.840]   you do not stimulate the health of that skeletal muscle.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.740]   You do not stimulate muscle in a way
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.800]   that would be necessary for outcomes that matter.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.200]   And outcomes that matter are sarcopenia.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.500]   Outcomes that matter are body composition,
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.580]   prevention of obesity.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   You must get this nutrition right.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.580]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.420]   - As many of you know,
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.320]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.780]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.540]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.660]   Rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.060]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.540]   And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.120]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.300]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.280]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.620]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.320]   a vegetarian, or a vegan,
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.500]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.040]   that you should get most of your food
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.560]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.120]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.160]   probiotics, and micronutrients
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.580]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.360]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.920]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.720]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.680]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.280]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.040]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.880]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.160]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.840]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.080]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.120]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.720]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.440]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.480]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.620]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.040]   So while many supplements out there
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.200]   are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.940]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.120]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.640]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.040]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.480]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.920]   to claim a special offer.

[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.740]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.560]   - It's great that we're focusing on muscle
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.600]   and then referring to obesity,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.440]   because I think so many people,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.640]   virtually everybody thinks, okay, reduce body fat.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.560]   How do you do that?
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.020]   You get the calories in, calories out equation
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.860]   in a certain direction.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.940]   And by the way, I believe in the law of thermodynamics
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.860]   and calories in, calories out.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.480]   But by focusing on muscle protein synthesis
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.080]   and muscle health through the ingestion
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.860]   of quality protein early in the day,
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.040]   I see that you're entering this
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   all through a different channel,
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.840]   but that the end points of reduced body fat, et cetera,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.240]   as we'll get into later, one can still arrive there.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.760]   So just for practical purposes,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.720]   what are some excellent sources of quality protein
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.840]   for that first meal?
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.320]   - Well, now the quality of protein
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.400]   is defined by the amino acid composition.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.040]   And typically animal-based proteins have higher quality.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.300]   These are hard, fast biological numbers.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.800]   The dietary protein in say a steak
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.480]   is very similar to the protein amino acid in skeletal muscle.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.740]   So the quality of the proteins like eggs,
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.900]   like whey protein, like beef, like poultry,
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.760]   those compositions are similar
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.940]   to the human body composition.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.120]   So they contain the amino acids in the appropriate ratios
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.440]   for skeletal muscle health.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.060]   Now, plant-based proteins have a different composition
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.740]   and they have a composition obviously similar to plants.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.400]   And one can get enough of the essential amino acids
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   if the total caloric load of that protein is high enough.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.480]   And I think that that's important to recognize
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   because right now the American diet is 70% plant-based
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.520]   and we seem to be moving more towards a plant-based diet.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.360]   - Is that right? - It is.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.980]   - I mean, I know there's sort of a movement toward that.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.040]   You hear about plant-based,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.100]   but so most people are not eating steak and eggs
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.340]   for breakfast, we know that.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.180]   - Well, most people, when I say 70% plant-based diet,
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.540]   I'm talking about refined carbohydrates, sugars,
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.320]   refined oils. - Cereals.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.460]   - And when we think about it,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.460]   so that 70% of our diet comes from that
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.180]   where 30% comes from animal-based proteins,
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.140]   which contain a ton of nutrients
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.820]   like bioavailable zinc and selenium, B12.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.860]   But when it comes to muscle health,
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.140]   one could, as long as they are thinking about making sure
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.540]   that the overall protein load is high enough
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.780]   in that plant-based protein.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.780]   For example, one would not choose quinoa as a protein source.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.060]   So six cups of quinoa would equal the same
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.340]   as one small chicken breast
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.780]   when it comes to an amino acid profile.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.160]   So I think one has to be aware that plant-based proteins
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.020]   typically have carbohydrates that ride along with them.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.560]   And that just becomes important
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.580]   for overall metabolic control
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.860]   when we think about total caloric load
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.640]   and total carbohydrates.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.540]   Someone could use a rice-pea blend of protein
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.060]   for that first meal.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.180]   That would certainly be sufficient.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.900]   Certainly, if someone is geared
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.300]   towards a more plant-based diet
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.780]   and doesn't want to consume animal proteins,
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.980]   that's what I would use.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.740]   - Is there any evidence that combining
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.280]   a high-quality protein with carbohydrate
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   in that first meal is more or less beneficial
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.560]   than having the protein alone?
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.800]   - That's a good question.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.480]   I would say that we don't have evidence for that,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.660]   that it would be more beneficial,
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.500]   because the question would be,
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.240]   what is the benefit that we're looking for?
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.840]   If the benefit that one is looking for is diversity,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.920]   then certainly, because we know carbohydrates
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.600]   can have fiber, phytonutrients,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.380]   if you're gonna combine it with berries,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.420]   that could certainly be advantageous.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.160]   But not necessary.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.880]   What becomes interesting is when we think
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.000]   about designing a diet, does that second meal matter?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.520]   And not to get too technical,
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.240]   but maybe we could get a little technical here,
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.000]   is that when you stimulate muscle protein synthesis,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.360]   that will last about two to three hours.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.880]   Now, the next thing one would think is,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.440]   well, I know that I need a certain amount of protein
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.480]   for overall muscle health.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.400]   The amount of protein for overall muscle health
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.800]   could be anywhere from one gram per pound
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.440]   ideal body weight to lower.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.600]   And when we think about how we are designing a diet,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.080]   we have to recognize that the current recommendations
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.700]   are the minimum to prevent a deficiency.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.080]   The way in which diets are designed now,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.140]   according to the RDA, is 0.8 grams per kg.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.560]   - 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.160]   - Which comes out-- - Total body weight.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.240]   - Yes, which comes out to be 0.37 grams per pound.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.160]   So if someone was 115 pound female,
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.040]   that current RDA would be 45 grams of protein.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.160]   - Way below what we talked about earlier.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.720]   - Right, and these are very important concepts
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.120]   to understand the foundations
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.580]   of how we think about dietary protein.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.720]   The current RDA, which is a minimum to prevent a deficiency,
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.600]   is based on nitrogen balance.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.240]   Nitrogen balance, and by the way,
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.720]   the recommendations for protein
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.000]   that were set in the '80s have not changed,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.160]   which means one of two things,
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.360]   we haven't had new science come out,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.080]   or we just haven't recognized the importance of protein.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.640]   And I think that it's more likely the latter,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   that we have not yet recognized,
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.760]   even though there's a plethora of data.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.520]   And I worked on some of these earlier studies,
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.680]   which I'll share, I even brought the numbers
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.160]   to make sure that I said them right,
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.920]   because this is the Human Lab Podcast.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.660]   - Well, I've made numerical errors before on the podcast,
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.140]   but great that you brought the numbers.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.480]   We always try and correct any errors,
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.400]   but great to be precise the first time, so thank you.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.860]   - When we think about how we design a diet
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.040]   for optimal muscle health is very different
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.900]   than how we design a diet for, again, just life.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.920]   And the two are very different.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.640]   The RDA for leucine, which is that essential amino acid,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.280]   meaning we cannot make it, we must get it from the diet,
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.200]   is set at 2.7 grams per day.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.960]   - That's a trivial amount.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   - That is a trivial amount, and--
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.360]   - 2.7 grams total per day. - 2.7 per day.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.560]   And one must understand that this came
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.320]   from nitrogen balance studies,
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.140]   and typically those are young men, 18-year-old men.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.560]   That does not support healthy aging
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.400]   or anyone that is struggling with obesity
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.800]   or any kind of chronic illness or anything.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   And so then when we begin to think,
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.360]   well, what do we actually need?
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.440]   The evidence would support two to three times that amount,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.560]   closer to nine grams of leucine per day.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.520]   - And just to calibrate us, nine grams of leucine,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.200]   which again is an essential amino acid
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.420]   we can only get from food, per day,
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.660]   what does that equate to in terms of the total amount
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.840]   of, let's say, egg or steak protein
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.200]   that one would need to eat in order to ensure that?
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.660]   Just roughly. - Yes, yes.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.760]   Wonderful question.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.200]   So there's a meal threshold for skeletal muscle health,
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.680]   and that meal threshold is a minimum of 30 grams.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   Now, that would equal a 4 1/2-ounce steak,
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.800]   dare I say six eggs, which is a lot of eggs at one time,
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.160]   or a scoop of whey protein.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.680]   Scoop of whey protein might have 18 grams of protein
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.720]   and 2 1/2 grams of leucine.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.380]   Maybe you do a 25-gram whey protein shake.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.000]   And that becomes important to understand
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.120]   because it is a meal threshold amount.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.040]   You know, we are talking about,
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.280]   you know, the reason why I was so excited
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.080]   to come on this podcast is because I think
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.500]   that if we can correct our nutrition
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.000]   and we gear it towards skeletal muscle health,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.240]   then we can change the trajectory of aging,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.860]   and we can stop focusing on obesity
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.360]   and really focus on skeletal muscle health.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.680]   But the only way that we're gonna do that
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.660]   is if we get this nutrition right,
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.800]   because skeletal muscle requires dietary protein.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.160]   There's only two main ways
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.200]   that we can stimulate skeletal muscle,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.900]   and that is through exercise,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.340]   primarily resistance training, and dietary protein.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.380]   And so when we think about how we design a diet,
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.100]   if you look back at the history,
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.020]   we have to recognize a handful of things.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.060]   Number one, that these essential amino acids,
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.740]   primarily leucine, is necessary
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.220]   to trigger muscle protein synthesis, number one.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.740]   Number two, that aging impairs the efficiency
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.860]   of muscle protein synthesis.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.240]   - I see, so it's a runaway train.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.740]   If you start getting sarcopenia,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.400]   if there's obesity and other markers of aging,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.940]   I realize obesity can occur at young ages too,
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:25.360]   but muscle loss, then basically you're losing muscle quality
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.700]   aka protein synthesis and other things.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.580]   And as a consequence,
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.500]   it makes it harder to increase muscle quality.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.180]   So you have to short circuit this pretty early.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.500]   - Yes, and I would even say that we talk about sarcopenia
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.080]   as a disease of aging,
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.180]   but I think that there is a youthful phenotype of sarcopenia.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.660]   If we define sarcopenia
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.720]   as decreased muscle mass and strength,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.700]   that can easily affect our youth.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.520]   You know, we talk about health span.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.060]   We talk about lifespan.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.880]   There's also muscle span.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.400]   And muscle span is this concept
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.400]   that is really about the skeletal muscle health as we age.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.820]   And there's three primary components to that.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.140]   That's understanding that skeletal muscle health
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.740]   begins very early on.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.460]   And we're gonna talk about,
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.380]   'cause I know that there's parents.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.220]   I have two little kids.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.440]   So I wanna talk about the amount of protein
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.500]   necessary for children, of course.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.260]   And then as we think about this muscle span,
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.260]   there is early on, early age,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.180]   where you're laying down the foundation,
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.120]   where you're hopefully training, doing exercise,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.700]   just doing movement.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.500]   Being sedentary is a disease state in and of itself,
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.100]   period, end of story.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.940]   Being sedentary is not the opposite of activity.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.380]   Being sedentary is in and of itself
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.620]   a disease of inactivity.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.860]   Then midlife, we have to maintain the tissue.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.420]   We get a peak muscle mass in our 30s.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.460]   We get a peak bone mass around the same time.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.640]   And then that later half of life,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.340]   we have to do everything that we can to maintain that tissue
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.580]   because of this decrease in efficiency of skeletal muscle.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.500]   So skeletal muscle, as a nutrient-sensing organ,
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.300]   can respond like youthful tissue.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.700]   And the way that it responds like youthful tissue
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.220]   from an amino acid perspective,
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.340]   just thinking about how we eat to maintain that,
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.320]   is that when we increase our dietary protein,
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.860]   so older individuals or individuals as they age
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.980]   require more protein to then stimulate mTOR.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.020]   - So does that mean instead of eating 30 grams of protein
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:31.020]   per meal minimum, that people older than say 50, 60,
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.140]   should eat 40 or 50 grams of protein?
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.180]   - I would say that that's true.
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.060]   - Interesting.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.580]   - And by the way,
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.340]   skeletal muscle will mount a youthful response.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:45.580]   The initial work was out of Bob Wolf's lab.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.400]   He's an icon in the industry of protein.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.280]   He's one of the, can I say grandfathers now?
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.240]   I mean, that's pretty embarrassing.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.960]   And when I think about Bob Wolf and Don Lehman
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.400]   and these guys, you know, I trained with Dr. Donald Lehman.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.040]   You know, these initial studies that we think about
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   and we take for granted dietary protein,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.880]   we think, okay, well, the bros have always known this,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.600]   but we have not.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.320]   And when you are younger,
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.400]   there is a somewhat of a linear response.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.120]   Let's say a younger individual, still growing,
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.680]   we'll just call them 10, 12 years old or my children.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.540]   I have a three and a four and a half year old.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.560]   They will respond with five grams of dietary protein,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.920]   10 grams of dietary protein, 15 grams of dietary protein
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:42.560]   versus an older individual will not respond at all to that.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.940]   However, that response can be augmented
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.800]   by increasing the dietary protein at that meal.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.240]   So an older individual will respond
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   like a younger individual by 30 grams of protein,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.040]   30 to 50.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.840]   - Later, we're going to talk about supplements,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.080]   but I'm very curious.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.060]   Is there a place for supplementing leucine
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.120]   and other branch chain amino acids specifically?
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.280]   You know, I always assumed that supplementing
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.400]   with branch chain amino acids was kind of the unique domain
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.360]   of people, you know, post-exercise,
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.420]   trying to build more muscle.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.080]   But as you're telling me all this,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.080]   it seems that adding leucine in powder form to a meal
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.240]   seems like it would be great for muscle health.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.760]   Is that true?
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.800]   - I would say that we do not add leucine alone
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.580]   because leucine, isoleucine and valine go hand in hand.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.260]   It would not be advisable to add a single amino acid.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.420]   The amino acid levels are maintained in the blood.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.700]   By adding more of one would have effects on the other.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.420]   The way in which I would think about supplementing
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.920]   essential amino acids and or branch chains
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.560]   would be if an individual is choosing
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.340]   to have a lower protein meal.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.300]   I remember when I was in residency,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.940]   the food choices were not very good
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.620]   and maybe I had two ounces of fish,
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.500]   which wasn't enough to bring me up to a threshold.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.020]   That would be a place that I would add
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.620]   in branch chain amino acids or essential amino acids.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.140]   That would bring someone's amino acid threshold up.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.020]   But we have to understand everything that we're doing,
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.140]   we should be doing with a purpose.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.460]   The idea of just sipping on branch chain amino acids
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.060]   or just adding amino acids would be the equivalent
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.420]   of putting a key into a car and trying to turn the car on,
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.160]   but not having any additional substrate.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.740]   So you need the full spectrum of all the amino acids
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.660]   to affect skeletal muscle health.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.020]   - Yeah, well, that's reassuring to hear
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.760]   because I love the taste of scrambled eggs and steaks.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.220]   And I also like tuna and I also like chicken
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.140]   and I love all those things.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.900]   And I have to imagine that as you mentioned before,
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.460]   there are other things in these quality animal proteins.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.900]   Like you mentioned selenium,
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.240]   you mentioned other perhaps essential fatty acids
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.180]   and other vitamins that perhaps have something to do
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.320]   with what the animal ingested during its life
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.060]   that also benefit muscle.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.000]   Is that true?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.840]   - It is.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.220]   And the big standout to me is creatine.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.820]   We know that creatine at five grams of creatine
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.400]   will affect skeletal muscle,
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.900]   but 12 grams of creatine affects brain health.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.220]   And there's a lot of interesting research coming out
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.540]   on creatine and brain health.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.440]   - Can you remind me the rough amounts of creatine
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.640]   and say, you mentioned a, let's just,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.760]   I mean, I must say a four and a half ounce steak
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.240]   feels rather poultry to me.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.080]   That's probably the size of it.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.680]   - Which is a huge meal to me.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.280]   - Right, so let's say a six ounce, let's be generous.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.940]   A six ounce steak or four scrambled eggs.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.640]   I mean, how much creatine are we talking?
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.120]   Eggs don't have much creatine, right?
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:56.960]   - Not much.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.040]   And I was just recently looking at this,
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.100]   the amount of creatine in a pound of steak,
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.760]   you're gonna cringe, is something like two grams.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.600]   - So it's not very much.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.840]   - It's not very much.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.880]   But when we think about eating foods as in a food matrix,
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.080]   what you're saying is absolutely true there.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.760]   It's interesting, we don't eat single nutrients.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.320]   While we think about dietary protein as a single nutrient
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.480]   and we think about carbohydrates,
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.000]   but what we really do is we eat mixed meals.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.160]   And when we think about that,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.120]   the quality of the protein matters.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   From a protein perspective,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.880]   could you get plant-based proteins and animal-based proteins
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.720]   and could it be equal?
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.560]   Yes, it could.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.720]   So I wanna be very clear to say
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.340]   and have a very balanced perspective
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.640]   that we could get all of our dietary protein
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.720]   from plants, from plant-based sources.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.440]   A few caveats there is that that RDA
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.160]   that I gave you earlier is based only
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.340]   on high quality proteins.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.160]   And that being the minimum to prevent a deficiency.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.800]   If an individual was plant-based,
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:01.760]   they would require closer to 1.6 grams per kg,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.400]   a higher amount of total protein if it's coming from plants.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.640]   And that becomes important to understand.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   - Speaking of an ideal world, if you had a magic wand.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.600]   - I do.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.680]   - What would be the--
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.120]   - My kids think I do.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.400]   - I bet you do.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.360]   What would be the amount of protein
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.480]   that you would have everybody eat?
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.920]   In terms of a number of grams per pound
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   or kilogram of body weight.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.560]   - That's actually an easy question.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.120]   One gram per pound, ideal body weight.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.840]   - Total body weight, not lean body weight.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.520]   - Ideal body weight, actually.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.920]   Where you want to be.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.360]   If an individual is 200 pounds
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.520]   but would prefer to be 150 pounds,
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.240]   then I would have them eat towards their ideal body weight.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.520]   There's no evidence that a higher protein diet
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.800]   is detrimental to kidney health, to bone health.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.600]   And we use these terms loosely, like a high protein diet,
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.080]   when we have to recognize that 0.8 grams per kg
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.760]   is a low protein diet.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.120]   - So where did the idea come from
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.320]   that if you eat, say, one gram of quality protein
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.840]   per pound of ideal body weight,
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.160]   that you're gonna get gout,
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.720]   you're going to have liver issues,
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.160]   you're gonna have all sorts of issues.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.280]   Where did that idea come from?
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.160]   - Frankly, I'm not sure.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.040]   But the conversation around dietary protein
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.440]   has probably been the most controversial.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.480]   - Why do you think that is?
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.440]   I mean, we're not trying to get political here.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.280]   I'm just so curious.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.120]   - I have some ideas, but I won't share them.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.440]   - Okay, that's fine.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:33.440]   - I do feel as if nutrition is not just science.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.200]   Nutrition is complicated
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.440]   because it's something that people tie emotion to,
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.160]   they tie religion to,
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.000]   there's a lot that goes into dietary protein
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.960]   and food recommendations in general.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   - But it sounds like we can safely say
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.680]   that if you eat one gram of protein per pound
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.280]   of ideal body weight that you're not going
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.240]   to cause liver damage or get gout
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.400]   or increase your risk of cancer, right?
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.400]   My understanding is that even if it comes from red meat,
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.680]   there's no increase in risk of cancer, is that right?
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.080]   - Well, here's what I would say to that.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.560]   I would say that this idea about red meat and cancer,
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.960]   number one, we would have to even define
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.520]   what kind of cancers that we're talking about.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.240]   There's many different types of cancers
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.720]   and there's many different causes.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.040]   It would be important to understand what risk factors are.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.000]   And a primary risk factor to many cancers is obesity.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.600]   The question then becomes how do we design a diet
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.640]   that mitigates obesity?
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.560]   The evidence is also very clear
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   that a more protein forward diet optimizes body composition.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.840]   And you combine that with resistance training
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.000]   and you will see a tremendous amount of change.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.880]   I worked on some of these early studies
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.960]   and I'll share with you some of the early studies
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.800]   and this came out of Don Lehman's lab
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.280]   with the University of Illinois.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.360]   - Both you and Layne Norton both worked there, yeah?
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.200]   - Yes.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.040]   - Did you overlap them?
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:56.880]   - We did.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.720]   - Okay, what was he like?
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.560]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.640]   - So let's just say he sat in the back of the class
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.480]   and I sat in the front.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.400]   - Okay, all right, there, you heard it.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.120]   Shots fired.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.680]   - And all kidding aside, Layne, he's like my brother.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.360]   We've known each other for 20 some years.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.040]   - Yeah, he's a very popular guest,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.680]   former guest on this podcast and a very spirited guy.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.800]   - And I'd just like to say,
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.320]   I don't know why his skin looks that good,
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.840]   but whatever.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.680]   So I worked on--
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.560]   - Love you, Layne.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.680]   - I've worked on, yes, we do.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.120]   I worked on some of these early studies
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:28.200]   and this was, these studies were some of the first studies
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.280]   to come out about dietary protein,
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.680]   nutrition and resistance training.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.800]   In fact, to my knowledge and to, I think,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.460]   the knowledge of many of my colleagues,
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.060]   this was the first study.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:44.820]   And what it was, it was a 12-month study,
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.680]   130 overweight men and women.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.080]   So it was robust.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.840]   And basically what they did is they had two groups.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.760]   One group was a food guide pyramid diet.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.400]   So it was 55 grams of carbohydrates,
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.560]   a RDA of protein, which was 0.8 grams per kg,
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.640]   and 30% fat.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.560]   30% fat was in both groups.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.400]   The second group was 40% carbohydrates.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.960]   This is, remember the zone diet, 40/30/30?
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.320]   - Yeah, I liked that diet.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.840]   - Okay, I mean, there's evidence--
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.460]   - Ish, I mean, I don't follow it anymore,
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.200]   but I tried it for a little while and--
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.040]   - And it works great.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.480]   And there's some evidence to support
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.440]   that that is a great ratio for people.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.360]   - Coming off the low-fat era of the late '90s,
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.200]   the zone diet felt like the best thing ever
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.700]   because it was like, oh, you can enjoy some fats
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.520]   and wow, your satiety is improved and you get stronger.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.200]   You just feel better when you're ingesting
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.240]   some ideally quality fats.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.080]   That's my experience anyway.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.880]   - Yes, and also we know that it influences hormonal status.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.560]   You don't wanna push fats too low.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.240]   So the second group had a 40/30/30 split.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.560]   So it was 40 grams of carbohydrates,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.000]   30 grams of protein, 30% fat.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   So these are all percentages.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.680]   - Yeah, 40%, right.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.460]   - Now, we didn't talk so much about the distribution,
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.440]   but what is really important to understand
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.840]   is they were isocaloric.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.920]   So they both had the same calories.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.560]   The difference was the percentage
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.480]   of where the calories came from and how they were given.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   And there was actually four different arms to this.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.820]   So there was individuals that exercised
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.220]   and individuals that didn't.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.480]   - Okay, so either zone diet or let's call it,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.320]   I hate to say this, but more standard American diet.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.840]   - No, it was, and that's how it was designed.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.280]   - Standard American versus zone diet.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.720]   - Yes, so it was designed that way.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.760]   - And then exercising or non-exercising for each of those.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.540]   - For this 12-month study.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.880]   And by the way, I had to pack a bunch of meals.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.120]   It was not pretty, and I had to do urine analysis.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.800]   It was terrible.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.760]   But anyway, this is besides the point.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:48.440]   So the first group had a protein distribution
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.440]   of 10 grams in the morning, 15 at lunch, and 45 at dinner.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.520]   - And kind of standard American diet.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.840]   - So that mirrors-- - Steak for dinner.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.820]   - Exactly. - You have some cereal
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.320]   for breakfast with a little bit of milk,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.520]   and then for lunch, like a sandwich.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.460]   - Exactly, and so this mirrors what people do.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.620]   The other group had 45 grams of protein at that first meal.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.760]   - Five, six eggs. - Five, six eggs.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.980]   35 grams of protein at lunch, and 35 grams of protein
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.820]   at dinner. - So chicken breast
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.740]   in a salad at lunch with a little piece of toast,
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.380]   and then at dinner, how much?
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.860]   - It was 35 grams.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:23.020]   - All right, a piece of fish and some rice and a vegetable.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.560]   - But it was an even distribution.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.300]   So what you're seeing here is now these meals
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.660]   are meeting a leucine threshold
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:31.500]   of muscle protein synthesis.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.980]   Now it's 100, this is collectively 130 individuals,
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.580]   and they were older.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.260]   I think that they were all in their 40s or beyond.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.420]   - If we just compare first the groups
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.220]   that did not exercise, two different diets,
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.580]   what did they see?
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.420]   What did you see?
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.040]   You participated in this study.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.880]   - Yes, I did.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.700]   - You almost said, "Unfortunately."
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.540]   - I said, "Unfortunately."
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.340]   No, I won't.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:56.460]   But what was so interesting is that those individuals,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.540]   everybody lost weight.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:00.100]   So the average weight loss, gosh,
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.780]   I wish I had better handwriting, but I'm a doctor,
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.380]   and so it's pretty bad.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.060]   The average weight loss was 24% greater
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.420]   in the high protein group.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.380]   So they lost 24%.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.420]   - And you said it was isocaloric between the two groups.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.260]   - That's right.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.180]   - But was it subcaloric overall?
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.340]   - It was. - People were ingesting.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.300]   - That's very smart.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.100]   Yes, it was 500 calories less.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.820]   - Than what they needed to maintain body weight.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:22.660]   - Correct. - Okay, got it.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.220]   So 24% more weight loss total.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.040]   - Total.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.020]   - In the group that distributed their protein evenly
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.700]   and followed the so-called zone diet, 40, 30, 30.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.700]   They lost more fat than the high-carbohydrate group.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:42.300]   So the high-protein group lost a total of 16 pounds
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:47.180]   versus the calorie-controlled group lost 11 pounds.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.020]   - Of fat.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:48.960]   - Of fat, which is great.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.180]   Everyone's at home thinking this is wonderful.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.020]   - Isocaloric.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:53.780]   - Isocaloric, but the thing here
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.580]   is the lean body mass change.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.500]   So again, this was done using DEXA,
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.380]   and we know DEXA only looks at lean body mass.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.260]   - You mentioned DEXA earlier.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   Just very briefly, how does DEXA work?
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.700]   Not at a mechanistic level.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.540]   What does it look like?
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.820]   I go into the clinic, am I floating in water?
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.780]   - No, you're getting scanned.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.620]   - I'm holding the paddles.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.780]   - Well, you might be because you're Andrew Huberman, but--
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.620]   - No, no, no, but you hold the paddles
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.740]   and you're standing outside.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.580]   What's it do?
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.940]   - So DEXA, you just lay on, depending on the machine,
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.900]   you can just lay on this machine, and it's a dual X-ray,
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:29.900]   and it measures bone, fat, and then lean body mass.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.900]   - Okay, that's sufficient for this conversation, great.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.340]   - So the lean body mass loss,
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:39.340]   and again, this is everything other than bone and body fat.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.500]   So that was 34%.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.540]   - In which group?
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.420]   - In the standard American diet group,
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.460]   versus 26% in the high protein group.
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:50.620]   Now where it gets fascinating,
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.380]   so what the big takeaway is,
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:57.820]   is understanding that protein had a sparing effect.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.980]   - Protein protected muscle, more body fat loss,
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.060]   at the same caloric amounts.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.100]   - Yes.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.900]   - Same amount of deficit relative to body weight.
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.660]   - Right, in this group, exercise was not introduced.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.380]   So this was purely the food guide pyramid,
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.100]   changing protein in the morning,
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:19.980]   versus having it at two small meals,
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.220]   and then having it at dinner.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.740]   - And did they emphasize what we're calling
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.860]   high quality protein?
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.700]   - They did.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.540]   - Okay.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:26.360]   - That is also very important.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.420]   - Meat, fish, eggs, chicken, et cetera.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:28.940]   - Yes, they did.
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.940]   So then this led to another study.
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.860]   So then the second study was a two by two design,
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.700]   and this is-
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.800]   - Oh, sorry, sorry to interrupt.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:36.940]   In that previous study,
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.460]   what was the effect of exercise between the two groups?
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.300]   - They didn't do exercise.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.120]   - Got it, okay.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:41.960]   - Sorry, that was my fault.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.020]   They did not do exercise.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.980]   They were just doing whatever it was that they were doing.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.140]   But what was so important to understand
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.660]   was that this set the stage for this idea
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.900]   that protein had a sparing effect.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.600]   And then following that,
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.320]   the other study,
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.780]   so then there was a series of a few other studies.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.660]   The second study looked at diet and exercise.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.860]   So this combined effect.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.220]   So this was one of the first studies,
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.220]   and this was 48 women with a BMI of 33, 46 years old.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.220]   So this is your peri post-menopausal woman
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.640]   who was either in one of four treatment groups,
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.600]   a low protein group, low protein with exercise,
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.960]   high protein, high protein with exercise.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.400]   The low protein group was defined as the RDA, 0.8 grams.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.940]   The high protein group was defined as 1.6 grams, kg.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:43.060]   - So starting to approach that one gram per pound.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.260]   - It's about 0.7 grams per pound.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.460]   - So starting to get there, but not quite there.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.780]   - So this was a 16 weeks study.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.060]   And what they found overall
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.420]   was that the high protein group lost 18% more body fat
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:05.260]   and 25% less lean mass overall,
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.260]   and 12% more total body weight.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.260]   And so now we start moving into this synergistic effect
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.840]   of dietary protein and resistance training.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.420]   - And it was the type of exercise
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.100]   that they perform their resistance training?
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.480]   - This is the good news.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.300]   It didn't take much.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.140]   It was five days a week of walking 30 minutes
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.940]   and two days a week of resistance training
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.220]   with just body weight.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.100]   It was like yoga activity.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.540]   - So air squats, down dogs, some warrior poses,
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.300]   maybe some handstand attempts.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.060]   - So yeah, no one is doing handstand.
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.100]   Rob, are you doing handstands?
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:42.940]   No one's doing handstands.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.620]   - I've done yoga classes where I look to the sides of me
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.340]   and people are doing some pretty difficult things.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.180]   - Very impressive.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.180]   - Some planches and things like that.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.020]   - Definitely not me.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.900]   Do not invite me.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.860]   Life is better this way.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.060]   I'm not going to those classes.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.800]   But 16 weeks, they did a high protein
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.740]   with protein and exercise.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.260]   Those individuals.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:06.020]   So now, so the study, the group that I just mentioned,
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:10.080]   this was dietary intervention alone.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.580]   With exercise, high protein plus exercise,
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.780]   very simple exercise.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.660]   So if someone is listening to this and they're thinking,
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.780]   what can I do to make very practical changes
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:24.500]   to massively impact my life outside of hormone replacement,
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.740]   outside of any super supplement, outside of anything?
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.820]   Diet and exercise has a dramatic effect.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:35.260]   Those individuals that were doing 1.6 grams per kg,
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.760]   which is 0.7 grams per pound of body weight plus exercise,
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.720]   lost 46% more body weight.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.380]   That's substantial.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:50.380]   60% more fat and 40% less fat-free mass
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:57.420]   from organs, muscle, whatever that is,
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.340]   compared to the low protein group plus exercise.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.500]   - And was it subcaloric?
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.740]   Were they below maintenance weight?
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:05.580]   - It was.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.100]   - So they're eating to ideal body weight,
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.500]   but still 500 calories or so below
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.380]   their current caloric needs to maintain body weight.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.580]   So I've heard before that when we eat protein,
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.080]   a certain amount of energy is required
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.140]   to metabolize that protein.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.780]   Can that be translated as the caloric load of protein
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.580]   is not what it appears to be?
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.420]   - Yes.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.820]   - Let's say that six ounce steak,
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.660]   I'm making this up,
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.920]   I'll probably get the numbers badly wrong,
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.800]   but if it's six ounces of steak,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.680]   and maybe that's a, let's just say a 450 calories
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.940]   or 500 calories,
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.960]   does that mean that only 400 of those calories
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.760]   are actually quote unquote utilized?
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.780]   - What you're talking about is a thermic effect of food,
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.960]   the thermic effect of feeding.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.160]   And that's the idea that certain macronutrients
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.560]   require a certain percentage of energy
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.420]   or the energy from those calories to be utilized.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.200]   For fat, it's something like 3%.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.440]   For carbohydrates, maybe it's 5 to 10%.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.000]   And then for protein,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.280]   it could be anywhere from 20 to,
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.660]   I've seen even studies that are at 30%.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.500]   - Wow.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.120]   - I know, but here is the thing.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.280]   It's not that it's the energy that it takes.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.240]   So if we were gonna make it simple,
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.840]   we'll say 100 calories from straight protein,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.160]   the body would net 80 calories
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.520]   because 20% of that energy is being used
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.880]   for what I would say is muscle protein synthesis.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.280]   It's not the handling of nitrogen, it's none of that.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.120]   And there's variations in the literature
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.280]   and the variations come from how an individual doses protein.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.480]   So the dosing, depending if you've hit that minimum 30 grams
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.840]   then you will see a more optimal utilization of protein.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.360]   And I think that that's where that number comes from.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.640]   It's actually the stimulation of muscle
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.240]   because that is such an energetic process in and of itself.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.440]   - I'd like to take a quick break

[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.980]   in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.120]   that many of the factors that impact your immediate
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.480]   and long-term health can only be analyzed
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.320]   from a quality blood test.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.080]   Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   is that you get information back about metabolic factors
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.240]   and hormones and lipids and so forth,
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.360]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.280]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.240]   to know what to do with those numbers
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.840]   because they have a personalized platform
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.480]   that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors,
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.920]   lipids, hormones, et cetera.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.840]   And they give you specific directives
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.800]   that you can follow related to nutrition,
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.640]   behavioral modification, supplementation, and more
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.920]   that can help you bring those numbers
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.200]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.860]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.160]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.640]   to get 10% off their new membership program.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.440]   InsideTracker membership offers significantly reduced prices
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.120]   on InsideTracker's comprehensive blood panels.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 10% off.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.360]   - Slightly tangential question, but I think meaningful
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.720]   given the context of what we're talking about.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.040]   Why is it that if I eat a plate of scrambled eggs
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.960]   or a steak or a chicken breast and some vegetables,
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.060]   I feel very sated?
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:32.000]   And unless I did some hard resistance training,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.920]   I'm kind of good with that.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.160]   But that if I eat any of those same foods
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.160]   and one piece of a baguette or one forkful of pasta,
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.680]   that then I want a lot more pasta
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.520]   and I want half the loaf of bread.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.680]   Why is that?
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.320]   Is it the blood glucose response?
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.840]   Is there something about carbohydrate
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.560]   at the level of the mouth?
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.400]   I mean, what is it?
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.640]   You know, a former guest on this podcast,
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.320]   Dr. Diego Borges, who studies gut brain sensing,
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.840]   explained to us, and this is separate from the microbiome,
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.880]   that we have receptors all along the length
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.960]   of our gut from our mouth out to the rectum
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.220]   that are sensing the amino acids
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.520]   and are looking for those essential amino acids,
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.160]   but also sensing sugar and things like that
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.480]   and signaling to the brain about how much more we should eat
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.800]   of a given food or forage for a given food.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.320]   And I just have to say at a psychological level,
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.160]   subjective level,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.020]   there's something so fundamentally different
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.820]   about eating protein and vegetables
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.480]   or protein fruits and vegetables
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.000]   in the absence of starchy carbohydrates.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.840]   And when adds starchy carbohydrates
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.320]   or eat starchy carbohydrates alone,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.520]   and it's like, it's not a runaway train,
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.360]   but it's almost as if like it's never quite enough
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.080]   until there's a physical volume in the gut
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.880]   that is like at threshold.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.240]   And I don't think I'm alone in this.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.600]   You look at the way people eat chips,
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.360]   you look at the way people eat pasta,
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.160]   you look at the way people eat risotto,
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.080]   and it's just different.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.440]   I mean, there are a few, you know,
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.360]   freaks out there that probably two ribeye steaks,
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.040]   but for most people, a ribeye steak is like enough.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:07:59.960]   One ribeye is enough.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.240]   What is going on there?
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.000]   And feel free to speculate, but is it amino acid sensing?
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.780]   And because I think this is really important
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:10.400]   because I think as you're suggesting, if I may,
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.800]   that people prioritize protein
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.500]   from the first meal of the day and throughout the day,
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.960]   you know, I think people are imagining,
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.320]   well, gosh, what happens to my pasta?
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.480]   What happens to the bread?
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.760]   What happens to all these things?
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.920]   And, you know, they're perhaps overlooking the fact
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.200]   that eating protein, vegetables, and maybe fruit,
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.480]   maybe a little bit of starch
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.520]   is just a completely different experience
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   than eating starch alone or starch in larger volumes.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.160]   - Now, I'm gonna speculate here.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.360]   The foods that we have access to are highly palatable
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.920]   and potentially we weren't necessarily designed
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.040]   to have access to those kinds of foods.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.320]   And this kind of moves into this idea
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.080]   of something called the protein leverage hypothesis.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.600]   And the protein leverage hypothesis
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.920]   is that individuals will continue to eat,
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.480]   and this is one way people explain obesity,
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.380]   is that individuals will eat to satisfy an amino acid need.
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.980]   Now, your original question was,
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.400]   when we eat carbohydrates or risotto,
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.040]   there is a component of blood sugar regulation that happens.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.120]   So as you go beyond that 50-gram threshold,
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.360]   you tend to release more insulin.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.800]   So there's an insulogenic effect of dietary carbohydrates,
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.080]   which some people will experience as lower blood sugar.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.900]   We've all had that experience where you're,
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.380]   I mean, not all, but eating your kid's macaroni and cheese,
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.300]   and then you just can't stop.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.540]   And then you probably feel very tired.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.620]   There's an ebb and flow of blood sugar.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.260]   The interesting thing about dietary protein
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.960]   is you will hear people say,
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.400]   I'm gonna reduce my dietary protein
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.880]   because it's insulinogenic as well.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.060]   So dietary protein does cause a phase one insulin release,
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.080]   and that's preformed insulin in the pancreas.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.640]   It is a component for muscle protein synthesis,
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:10.440]   but it is roughly 20% of the insulin response
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.760]   than the same amount of carbohydrates.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   And when you eat a meal that is robust in dietary protein,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.760]   your body will be able to then generate its own glucose.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.680]   Roughly for every 100 grams of protein,
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.840]   your body will generate 60 grams of glucose
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.240]   over a period of time
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.760]   through the process called gluconeogenesis.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.960]   And that is one of the benefits of a higher protein diet.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.760]   You generate the glucose that you need.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.040]   - And can that be converted into glycogen?
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.440]   - Yes. - Can you repack muscle
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.180]   that you've depleted? - That is a good question.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.800]   The process is very slow, so it's a much slower process
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.200]   than if you were to have your bread or risotto.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.400]   - So you told us about essential amino acids.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.240]   Are there any essential carbohydrates?
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.680]   - No.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.160]   - There are essential fatty acids.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.000]   - Yeah, there are.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.520]   And it's interesting, we're talking about protein.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   And as I mentioned before,
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.440]   we simplified in the way that we talk about it
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.640]   is it's one thing, but it's 20 different amino acids.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.700]   These amino acids each have unique metabolic roles
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.540]   in the body.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.180]   It's not interchangeable.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.460]   For example, the essential amino acid,
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.620]   we'll just pick a brain one, tryptophan,
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.340]   for serotonin production,
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.980]   or threonine for mucin production in the gut,
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.640]   which helps the gut lining,
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.300]   or take your pick, phenylalanine.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.860]   All of these essential amino acids
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.540]   do various things in the body.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.200]   For skeletal muscle,
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.420]   the primary essential amino acid is leucine.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.340]   And while, again, it is very complex
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.340]   in the way that we would think
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.660]   about how do we eat enough lysine,
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.860]   or how do we eat enough methionine,
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.420]   it's not a great way to think about it
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.860]   'cause then things become very complex.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.220]   And someone is like, "Well, what do I do?"
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.020]   But if you eat for the needs of skeletal muscle health,
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.360]   everything else falls into place.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.660]   - My mom is 79 years old.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.120]   She's relatively lean.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.600]   By my read, I haven't seen her DEXA results,
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.000]   but she's probably had some muscular atrophy.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.620]   She does yoga, she walks, she gardens,
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.880]   and seems to be in good health, thank goodness.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.800]   My guess is she's lost a muscle in the last decades.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.240]   If she were to increase the amount of protein,
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.240]   quality protein that she eats,
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.280]   especially in that first meal of the day,
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:42.100]   would the health of her muscle and her muscle mass change,
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:44.900]   even if she does no resistance exercise?
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   I mean, I suppose she gets a little bit
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.340]   of resistance training from the yoga,
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.420]   but I haven't been to a yoga class with my mom, ever.
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.780]   - You guys aren't doing headstands?
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.980]   - Definitely not doing headstands.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.140]   She's actually, you know, she's very mobile and very sharp,
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.440]   and very vivacious.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:04.060]   But I don't think she's doing the more, you know,
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.440]   advanced inversion things at yoga.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.280]   So let's assume that she's doing some moderate exercise
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.220]   three, four times a week, but not training with weights.
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.280]   If somebody like her, or, you know,
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.520]   a younger male that has a similar pattern of behavior,
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.400]   you know, desk worker for the most part,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.280]   jogs a little bit, gets on the recumbent bike,
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.760]   or whatever it is, but is not doing resistance training,
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:29.080]   increases their quality protein intake throughout the day.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.520]   And especially at that first meal,
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.780]   ensuring at least 30 and up to 50 grams of intake,
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.540]   what changes are likely to happen
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.180]   even without resistance exercise?
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.620]   - Well, the first thing is that if she is eating
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.180]   a sub amount of protein,
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.420]   let's say she's eating the RDA of protein,
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.900]   and the average woman eats around
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.060]   68 grams of protein a day,
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:55.300]   40% of women over the age of 60 are deficient in protein.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.140]   They're eating below the RDA.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.540]   - And what's happening to their body?
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.220]   Is their body robbing their existing skeletal muscle
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.180]   of amino acids in order to supply
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.740]   what the brain and other organs need?
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.980]   - In part, in part.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.860]   One of the things that happens with aging is the body,
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   the whole body protein turnover becomes less efficient.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.000]   So the body is turning over
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.620]   roughly 300 grams of protein a day.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.420]   - That's a lot of turnover. - It is a lot.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.780]   It is a lot of turnover.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.620]   - 300 grams of protein of turnover.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:30.620]   - Yes, and muscle only accounts for maybe 25% of turnover.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.380]   An individual might eat an average female,
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.740]   like your mom, is eating probably around
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.580]   68 grams of protein a day.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:43.100]   - Yeah, if I'm lucky, she's not big on beef or chicken.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.020]   - And listen-- - It's mostly eggs
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:46.440]   and a little bit of fish and lots of vegetables and fruits,
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.580]   but maintains, again, like a healthy, lean body weight.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.700]   - And that is wonderful 'cause she's balancing
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.820]   her lower protein intake with physical activity.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.100]   Remember, there are two main ways
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.340]   to stimulate skeletal muscle,
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.340]   and that's through resistance training,
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:03.600]   which one would argue she is doing, and/or dietary protein.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.380]   But when we think about muscle protein synthesis,
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.100]   there's really four inputs.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:12.060]   There's resistance training, there's energy,
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:16.980]   there's insulin, growth hormones, and then there's leucine.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.940]   When you are younger, your body is driven
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.860]   by more of the anabolic hormones,
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.880]   which is one reason why we believe
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.220]   that a younger individual can get away
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:29.100]   with five to 10 grams to 15 grams of dietary protein.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:34.100]   - Because their levels of testosterone and/or estrogen
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.440]   are driving protein synthesis in a way
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.040]   that lets them offset any dietary deficiencies?
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.820]   - Well, that their body is just highly anabolic.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.660]   They're growing, they're growing up, they're growing.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.620]   When an individual like your mom, who's now stopped growing,
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:52.840]   the body becomes much more reliant on leucine
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.860]   and resistance training, because the main pathway
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.740]   that these things go towards is something called mTOR,
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.720]   mammalian targeted rapamycin.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.740]   The influence on those pathways changes as we age.
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:07.440]   So the lever in which you pull changes,
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.460]   and the importance of that lever changes.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.800]   So the best thing that your mom could do
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.020]   to maintain skeletal muscle, so why,
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.780]   and what happens to skeletal muscle as we age?
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.360]   Skeletal muscle, if it is not contracted and utilized,
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.680]   gets this fat infiltration, mitochondria changes,
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.340]   protein turnover changes, it becomes less efficient
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.760]   at sensing amino acids.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.340]   There's a decrease in capillary perfusion,
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:35.500]   which is one reason why exercise is so important.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.160]   In order for her skeletal muscle to respond
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.980]   like a younger muscle, what she should do
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.540]   is do some kind of resistance training,
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:47.300]   and then add in some kind of dietary protein.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.340]   Because when we think about the protein hierarchy,
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:53.200]   the amount of protein in a 24-hour period matters the most.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.240]   Protein hierarchy, again, closer to one gram per pound
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.680]   ideal body weight, the evidence would say 1.6 grams per kg.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.940]   I'll never forget when the PROTAGE study came out.
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.820]   I can't believe I've been out of fellowship that long,
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:09.500]   but the PROTAGE study was a position paper,
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.380]   and it talked about how the current recommendation
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   for dietary protein is too low,
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.980]   and that to support healthy aging,
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.500]   you need 2.5 grams of leucine,
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.660]   or roughly 30 grams of protein,
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.140]   and an increase in total overall dietary protein.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.020]   And this was really the first position statement,
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.220]   and that came out, gosh, I think 2010.
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.900]   Yet we haven't changed any of the recommendations
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.060]   for the general population yet.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:40.380]   So in order for your mom's muscle to respond,
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.340]   if you compound those two things,
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.900]   then she will maintain, with activity,
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.420]   the health of her skeletal muscle.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.980]   You mentioned something else.
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.780]   An individual shouldn't just load protein.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.100]   Loading extra protein and not moving is not a good idea,
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:02.100]   because of protein's effect on mTOR throughout the body.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.340]   So we talked about mTOR,
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.460]   which is mechanistic target of rapamycin
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:09.320]   in skeletal muscle, in the brain, in the pancreas.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.640]   This is a protein complex
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.960]   that you just don't want stimulated all day long.
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.400]   - Yeah, for sake of cancer risk?
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.360]   - Yes, yes.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.800]   - My understanding is that mTOR is very highly expressed
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.760]   in all cells of the body,
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.320]   early in development and throughout growth.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.180]   In fact, it's expressed in the cells
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.520]   I spent my career working on, the retinal cells,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.720]   and then over time, it drops off.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.320]   And it's remarkable how studies
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.640]   where mTOR is replaced into cells
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   allows them to essentially look like
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.680]   and behave like young cells again,
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.120]   even replacing some regenerative capacity.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.640]   This is work of a guy named Zhigang He
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.760]   at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.760]   But what one always observes,
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.360]   and we've done these experiments in my lab,
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.840]   is that when you increase mTOR
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.800]   by any number of different ways,
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.980]   molecular cannery and things like that,
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.160]   that the cells grow enormous.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.120]   And the concern is always that if you increase mTOR,
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.220]   that you are going to bias any preexisting tumors
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.720]   to proliferate as well.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.040]   Is that right?
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.220]   - I think that yes, it is.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.680]   And we have to recognize that mTOR stimulation
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.840]   is different in different parts of the body,
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.880]   just as you mentioned.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.080]   And so skeletal muscle is uniquely sensitive to contraction,
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.080]   and it's through this biochemical process called RED1.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.680]   And when you contract skeletal muscle, it inhibits RED1,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.080]   which then, again, there is this phosphorylation of mTOR
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.800]   and muscle protein synthesis happens.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.540]   That is unique to skeletal muscle.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.760]   And when individuals will say,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.880]   this will be a common discussion that you hear in this space
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.240]   is that, well, I don't wanna increase my dietary protein
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.620]   because somehow that is gonna cause cancer.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:57.760]   And that is not true.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.000]   That is a very myopic thought process.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.880]   That would be the same as saying resistance training,
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.800]   which also stimulates mTOR, is going to cause cancer.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.200]   - Right, I completely agree with you.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.660]   I think it's interesting that mTOR,
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:16.560]   which in mice is mammalian target of rapamycin,
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.280]   that word rapamycin might prick up some people's ears.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.360]   There are some people out there,
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.160]   and by the way, I'm not recommending this,
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.720]   that take rapamycin as a way to inhibit mTOR
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.420]   in hopes of extending their lifespan.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.200]   There are some animal studies that support this.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.960]   There's growing interest in this.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.040]   And so much so that some people
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.600]   are willing to take rapamycin.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.640]   By that logic, a rapamycin would perhaps
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.440]   inhibit muscle growth, muscle health.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.520]   That's a whole other discussion.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.200]   We'd have to get Atiyah and a few,
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.160]   Matt Caberline and a few other folks here,
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.960]   and maybe we will with you to discuss that.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.840]   But the point being that I agree completely
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:59.080]   that we can't just say something that increases mTOR
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.640]   in muscle is also going to increase cancer,
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.960]   that these molecules like mTOR have distinct roles
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.240]   in distinct tissues at distinct time points
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.600]   throughout the lifespan.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.440]   And as you mentioned, ingesting quality protein
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.200]   can increase muscle protein synthesis
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.960]   by way of mTOR and other pathways,
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.480]   as well as resistance training.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.140]   And I don't think anyone in the longevity space
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.640]   would suggest that resistance training is a bad thing,
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.320]   and yet we know it's increasing mTOR.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.440]   So there's a little bit of a contradiction in that field,
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.920]   just if one stands back from it and says,
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.280]   "Well, wait, you want to take rapamycin to block mTOR,
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.600]   but you also want to do resistance training
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.960]   to stimulate mTOR, which one is it?"
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.160]   - Yeah, and we have to recognize that the efficiency
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.920]   of the stimulation declines as we age.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.080]   And the way that we overcome that is, again,
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.720]   this idea of muscle span.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   How do we continue to go through life and design a diet
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.040]   that we know will be more dependent on dietary protein
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.680]   and movement as we age?
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:57.160]   Because the balance between the two changes.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.280]   When you're young, you could eat the Twinkie diet,
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.600]   probably look at a weight and grow.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.560]   Age is the great equalizer.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.040]   You know, I trained in geriatrics,
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.480]   and I am telling you, age is the great equalizer.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.920]   And creating protocols and habits put into place
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.780]   to allow you to age well is everything.
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.620]   And there is so much confusion in the nutrition space
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:20.880]   that if we can pull back and recognize,
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:25.840]   well, number one, science is a evolving field,
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.880]   and it's the science of uncertainty.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.940]   But there are foundational principles
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.520]   that we can put into place.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.800]   And one of those foundational principles
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.360]   is skeletal muscle health.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.720]   Muscle as the organ of longevity must be supported.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.120]   And there are very few ways in which we can do that.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.520]   You know, when you think about the metabolic implications
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.800]   of skeletal muscle as glucose disposal unit,
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.640]   these diseases of aging really begin in skeletal muscle
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.440]   before you see any outward signs of obesity,
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.360]   before you see any outward signs
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.320]   of anything that would indicate you are unhealthy.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:08.480]   It's kind of like osteoporosis is the silent disease.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.880]   Skeletal muscle health is also that way.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.120]   And in fact, there's some very pivotal work out of Yale,
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.600]   and they looked at young, healthy college students.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.440]   You know, as a college student,
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.240]   you'll do anything for a couple of bucks, right?
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.220]   They pay them.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.560]   And these individuals were sedentary,
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.040]   but they were healthy, lean.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.800]   And what they saw was skeletal muscle insulin resistance
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.260]   just by being inactive.
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.520]   Can you imagine as you continue,
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.600]   and how do we define inactivity now?
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.800]   What is it, less than 5,000 steps?
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.200]   - Per day. - Per day.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.600]   - Wow, I mean. - And there's multiple ways.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.440]   I mean, think about it.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.560]   We were designed as humans to be very mobile.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.520]   And so now we live in a world
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.280]   that what we think about as sedentary behavior
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   is something innocuous and not a big deal.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.260]   It is a disease state.
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:04.420]   - So I feel like you've made an excellent case
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.040]   for the ingestion of sufficient amounts
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.640]   of quality protein each day,
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.060]   especially starting with that first meal of the day.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.740]   And just to underscore the suggestion that I heard,
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:19.320]   it was aim for one gram of quality protein
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.880]   per pound of target body weight.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.240]   So if somebody weighs 200 pounds
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.160]   and they'd like to weigh 180 pounds,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.400]   try and get 180 grams of quality protein per day
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.280]   divided up into meals that include somewhere
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.960]   between 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.640]   - Yes, and that first and last meal are the most important.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.840]   There's a lot of information going around
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.400]   that an even distribution has to happen.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.540]   And partially this is my mentor's fault.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.160]   He'll laugh.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.040]   This 30 grams of protein three times a day,
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.000]   I'm sure you've heard about it.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.880]   - Yeah, or that you can't assimilate
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.640]   more than 30 grams of protein per meal.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.120]   Let's drill into that.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.840]   - You assimilate all the protein that you ingest.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.920]   - Even if it's 100 grams?
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920]   - Correct, even if it is 100 grams.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.680]   Skeletal muscle protein synthesis
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.880]   will max out probably at 55 grams.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.000]   Again, maybe it's 50, maybe it's 55.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.060]   The rest is oxidized.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.000]   You can only incorporate so many proteins,
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.160]   so much protein, and the rest is then used as fuel
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.240]   or oxidized.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.720]   - What if I do hard resistance training
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.720]   in the hours before a meal,
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.640]   and then that meal includes 100 grams of quality proteins,
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.520]   let's say whey protein,
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.760]   do I put all of that 100 grams
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.440]   into muscle protein synthesis?
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.740]   - I would say, I don't know if you put all 100 grams,
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:39.240]   but I would guess that it would cap out at a certain number.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.040]   And really the totality of evidence would suggest
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.880]   it's probably around 55 grams.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.600]   - So regardless of whether or not
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.760]   somebody does resistance training,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.640]   you can ingest about 50 grams of protein,
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.680]   again, four calories per gram,
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.160]   typically into muscle protein synthesis,
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.720]   the rest is oxidized.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:57.560]   - Yes.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.520]   - Maybe just touch on that process of oxidation,
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.360]   what that looks like.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.400]   - Yeah, it's basically just utilizing those proteins.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.200]   It's utilizing them for energy.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.560]   It's not storing them,
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.680]   whether it goes back for gluconeogenesis
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.800]   or wherever it goes, it is then oxidized.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.840]   - Okay, and if that meal with,
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   let's say 50 grams of quality protein
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.760]   is combined with 50 grams of carbohydrate,
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.960]   they have fruit, some oatmeal, pasta, rice, et cetera,
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.040]   does that change the utilization of the protein at all?
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.360]   I know I asked this question earlier,
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.280]   but one could imagine that the body
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.560]   wants to use different fuel sources differently.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.040]   Is there any selective use of one macronutrient
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.240]   versus the other? - What a good question.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.320]   That's an excellent question.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.760]   The body, that amount, it will be seen as a mixed meal,
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   but the body will always choose to get rid of glucose first.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.720]   Glucose dominates metabolism,
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.960]   because again, it can be toxic to the body,
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.600]   so it must be utilized.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.680]   Now, what is also very interesting
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.680]   is that now you're talking about the speed of absorption.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.400]   One of the things that we should mention
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:12.400]   is typically you need a substantial rise in leucine,
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.000]   and that will be, again, that will probably take
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.840]   and last around two to two and a half hours.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.000]   So when you have a mixed meal,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.920]   that slows down absorption digestion.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.480]   This is where the quality of the protein comes in
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.440]   that becomes very important,
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:31.240]   because you have to reach a threshold in the blood
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.040]   to stimulate tissue.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.520]   And there was a very interesting study.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.880]   It's the first study of its kind,
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.840]   and this came out of Luke Van Loon's lab.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.080]   And basically, they looked at a vegan diet with,
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.680]   I think it had 40 grams of protein,
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.000]   and then it had a omnivorous diet,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.840]   so it had both sources of protein.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.360]   And what they found was that the individuals
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:55.560]   that had the 40-gram meal that was a mixed meal
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.440]   with animal-based proteins
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.880]   actually stimulated muscle protein synthesis,
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.200]   whereas the mixed meal of just the vegetables did not.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.640]   - Interesting.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.120]   - Even though it was plant-based proteins,
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.040]   enough protein in that meal,
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.320]   and that likely might be because of the rate of absorption,
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.640]   because of the fiber content,
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.480]   and it becomes important to recognize
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.920]   that a higher-protein meal seemed,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.120]   especially with the quality of the protein,
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.680]   that if you're picking the range between 30 and 50,
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.860]   depending on the mixed meal amount,
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:36.480]   I would certainly go towards that higher end.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.840]   - What is the case for fiber,
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.040]   either supplementing fiber or, in my case,
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.480]   I get fiber from fruits and vegetables mainly?
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.120]   - Fiber is extremely valuable.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.240]   It's extremely valuable for the gut microbiome.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.380]   It's extremely valuable for satiation.
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:54.120]   Fiber, if I were to design a diet,
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.160]   the first thing that I would pick would be dietary protein.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.320]   Then I would think about how I'm going to
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.000]   parse out the rest of the carbohydrates,
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.520]   because you earn carbohydrates through exercise.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.540]   I usually choose berries, high-fiber sources of berries,
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:08.960]   and then whatever fat is- - So blueberries,
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.520]   strawberries, blackberries. - Yes, all of them, yes.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.840]   - I'm a big fan of berries.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840]   - All of them. - I'm like a grizzly bear
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.720]   when it comes to berries.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.640]   I'm a drive-by blueberry eater when they're there.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.660]   I can't help but swipe them off the bowl or the plate.
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.360]   - But there was something else that you mentioned
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.240]   that I wanted to highlight,
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.200]   and this was if I did resistance training,
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.440]   then could I eat 100 grams of protein
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.680]   and then 100 grams of carbohydrates?
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.560]   The amazing part about exercise is,
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.360]   you know, what we really care about is glucose disposal
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.220]   and insulin sensitivity.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:44.220]   This idea of insulin resistance is killing our world.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:47.060]   - Young people, too. - Yes, yes.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:50.980]   We've seen double to triple the rates of childhood obesity.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.820]   - That's wild.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:56.820]   I don't think people younger than 25 recognize it.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.260]   Like when I was growing up in school, there was junk food.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.980]   Lord knows there was junk food.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:04.260]   There was also good food.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.760]   And different kids from different homes
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.020]   ate different amounts of junk food.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.820]   But it was the rare individual in school
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.240]   who was overweight, who was obese.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.120]   And you had some kids that seemed to be
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.860]   just kind of like born lean and with more muscle.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.520]   You had kids that were thinner with less muscle, less lean.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:31.220]   But it was very rare that there was an obese kid.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.920]   You just didn't see it much.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.680]   And I don't recall there being a lot of restrictive eating
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.780]   or even discussion about nutrition.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:39.960]   And people were eating cereals.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.240]   People were eating candy bars.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.920]   They were also eating eggs and sandwiches
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:47.380]   and chicken dinners and all sorts of stuff.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.160]   So what's happened?
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.080]   Really, what's happened?
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.840]   Because something is fundamentally different.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.060]   We had PE class that was required.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:55.900]   We had to run.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.060]   We had to play volleyball.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.360]   We had to do those things.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.900]   But it's not like we were all athletes
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:02.940]   and we'd walk to class.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.240]   I skateboard, I played some soccer,
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.320]   but I wasn't an athlete per se.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.080]   So like what in the world is going on?
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.180]   - I will say that also 2/3 of Americans
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.820]   are either overweight or obese.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.000]   - Yeah, it's wild.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.960]   I mean, again, one has to have been born in the '70s
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.680]   as I was, or early '80s to really appreciate
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.360]   this tremendous shift in kind of like what you see.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.880]   And sure, people are on phones more, more sedentary.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.220]   It's gotta be a combination of things, but there-
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.060]   - It's cultural.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:34.940]   We have a disease zone of inactivity and sedentary behavior
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:38.300]   that is frankly killing our population.
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:41.380]   Almost 50% of people have hypertension.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.960]   We have, what, 40 million people on statins.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   I'm sure that number has changed.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.300]   And skeletal muscle is medicine.
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.860]   Skeletal muscle, again, helps with triglycerides,
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:56.800]   helps with insulin, glucose disposal.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.780]   So where this came from, you just mentioned,
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:04.140]   if I exercise, then can I eat whatever you're eating?
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.180]   Yes.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:07.260]   But we're not talking about being irresponsible,
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:09.980]   but skeletal muscle now has sensitized.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.140]   Within, you know, there's a 24-hour period,
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:15.460]   72-hour period where that muscle is still sensitized.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.100]   - Meaning it consumes more nutrients.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.460]   - It consumes more nutrients,
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:23.000]   but also when you think about insulin resistance,
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.500]   insulin moves glucose out of the bloodstream into cells.
[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.260]   And through the muscle,
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:31.900]   there's the insulin-dependent pathway
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.700]   through obviously insulin,
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:39.140]   and that's whatever, PI3K, if you care, if anyone cares.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:42.500]   And then there is insulin-independent,
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.340]   which is through exercise.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.400]   And how glucose moves from the bloodstream into the cells
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.420]   is through GLUT4 receptors.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.060]   When you exercise, you increase the density
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:56.420]   of GLUT4 receptors to the surface just by doing activity.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.060]   It doesn't require insulin.
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:59.900]   You are able to then move glucose
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:01.720]   out of the bloodstream into cells.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.020]   And again, insulin resistance is at the heart
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:09.660]   of so many of the problems that we're seeing.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:14.020]   - Do you think that most people, including the,
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.460]   I'll just say it, the public health officials in charge,
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:20.220]   understand that, the points that you just made?
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:23.560]   I mean, clearly one doesn't have to even have a degree
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.100]   in medicine or science of any sort to look around
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.460]   and say, "Okay, there are a lot of people
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.260]   "suffering from obesity."
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:32.260]   And we are hearing more and more
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.020]   about the negative effects on brain,
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.460]   on other aspects of mental health and physical health,
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:39.500]   and the interrelatedness of mental health and obesity.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.140]   I mean, Dr. Chris Palmer from Harvard Medical School.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:42.980]   - He's a good friend, yes.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.660]   - Yeah, wonderful person, former guest on this podcast,
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:47.000]   very popular episode.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.820]   I mean, it's really been championing this issue
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.060]   as of a few folks at Stanford and elsewhere,
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.800]   this new field of so-called metabolic psychiatry,
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.520]   the link between brain health, mental health,
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.660]   and metabolic health.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.020]   But putting all that aside,
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.960]   do you think that most public health officials understand
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.960]   that muscle contraction increases glute floor expression
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:14.980]   at the level of muscle,
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:19.440]   which then grabs more nutrients from the bloodstream,
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.340]   which then lends itself
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:22.380]   to all sorts of positive health benefits
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:24.620]   and diverts from these negative health benefits?
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:27.620]   I mean, like, why isn't that on every billboard?
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:28.460]   Why?
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.820]   I mean, it's such a simple concept in principle.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:32.980]   Like, why aren't we hearing this?
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:35.740]   I mean, do they even require PE in school anymore?
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:39.220]   - No, I am not sure, but this is a problem.
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.060]   I don't know, but I would say
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:44.780]   if 2/3 of our population is either overweight or obese,
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.900]   the health officials may fall into that category,
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.900]   or at least 2/3 of them, potentially.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.940]   - Yeah, and I'm not blaming them.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:51.780]   I'm just wondering. - Of course.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.780]   - I mean, I don't think,
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:56.460]   well, I don't think we hear this message enough,
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.220]   that muscle contraction is medicine.
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.740]   We've heard that from Dr. Casey Means.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:01.540]   We're hearing about it from you,
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:04.220]   that muscle and muscle health in particular.
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:05.260]   And again, I'm so grateful
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.400]   that we're talking about muscle health and muscle quality
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.100]   and muscle as a tissue that utilizes nutrients
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:12.940]   and can divert things towards health and away from disease,
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.380]   as opposed to just muscle size,
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.520]   because I think most people hear muscle
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.360]   and they think eat for muscle,
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.260]   and they just think muscle size.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.780]   And frankly, most people don't want increased muscle size.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.080]   - But if you train for hypertrophy,
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.620]   which is muscle size, very difficult to get,
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.220]   especially as you age, by the way.
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:31.380]   It becomes much more difficult,
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.540]   but you will also get strength and power
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.620]   if an individual struggles.
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.100]   You know, if they fall, they break a hip,
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.500]   they have to be able to get up off the floor.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.340]   You have to be able to travel on an airplane
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.300]   and put your stuff overhead or pick up your toddler.
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.900]   Mine weighs 40 pounds.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:47.060]   - Or go downstairs.
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:49.540]   - What Dr. Peter Attia has really been emphasizing
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.260]   that a lot of life-ending injuries,
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:55.340]   life-ending injuries occur by virtue of people
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.180]   failing to do the eccentric movements
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:02.220]   that essentially look like stepping down off something.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:04.140]   I've had to have this discussion with both my parents.
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:05.460]   It was a little bit uncomfortable, frankly,
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.620]   because no one wants to be told,
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:07.580]   "Hey, listen, here are the things
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.580]   "that can potentially kill you.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.180]   "Don't worry so much about going upstairs.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.580]   "Make sure you hold the railing."
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:14.020]   Both of my parents being able-bodied,
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:15.100]   I'm grateful again for that.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:17.460]   But be careful as you walk downstairs.
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:22.340]   I mean, one fracture at age 79, 80, the age of my parents,
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.900]   I think I'm gonna get these numbers a bit wrong, I'm sure.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.100]   But I think Peter mentions that that leads to death
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.820]   in a large percentage of people that break that hip
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.100]   or break that leg or break that wrist even.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.380]   - Yes, and the other thing that-
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:36.420]   - Not because of the break itself,
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.100]   but because the inactivity that results.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.580]   - And that's absolutely right.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:43.240]   The skeletal muscle inactivity
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.500]   causes a derangement of metabolism.
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.220]   The derangement of metabolism
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:50.700]   will then go on to get fatty acid infiltration,
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:54.260]   fatty acids that infiltrate into skeletal muscle.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.860]   Once that happens, you now have a decreased flux.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.300]   You're not moving muscle glycogen.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.420]   You're not getting rid of these ceramides
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:04.780]   or these diacylglycerols that build up
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:07.820]   that potentially lead to and compound insulin resistance,
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:09.620]   skeletal muscle insulin resistance.
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:14.300]   You then generate a low-grade inflammation
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.840]   that is constantly going on.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:19.760]   If 40% of your body weight is skeletal muscle
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.120]   and you are not maintaining the health of skeletal muscle,
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.560]   you are walking around with an inflammatory bag on you.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:31.880]   This decline in aging,
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.880]   people think that we go through a linear decline in aging.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.720]   We don't.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.120]   We go through a series of catabolic crises.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.900]   And a catabolic crises would be something like
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.960]   someone falls, breaks a hip,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.240]   and never regains full functioning.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.120]   Or someone gets pneumonia,
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.920]   is on bed rest for five days or a period of time.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.720]   This compounds upon itself.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.080]   These catabolic crises compound upon themselves
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.140]   and individuals never return to full function.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.580]   The thing that becomes interesting and very important
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:12.240]   is that when you maintain the health of skeletal muscle,
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.360]   low muscle mass would be an early indication
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.680]   of osteoporosis.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.520]   Bone attaches to muscle.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.960]   Muscle pulls bone, creates a load,
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.520]   a stimulation that is required for building.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.480]   I mean, imagine the astronauts
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.260]   or an individual who, again, is on bed rest.
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.720]   When you are training
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.680]   and you are putting force and load on your body,
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:39.320]   then you're able to maintain the entirety
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.940]   of the architecture of the body.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.840]   And this all makes useful sense.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.980]   But it is underappreciated as an organ system.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.820]   And the other thing about skeletal muscle
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:51.620]   and depression and mood
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:54.640]   is that skeletal muscle and inflammation,
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.700]   as you contract it,
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.400]   the duration and intensity of contraction releases myokines.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.020]   So myokines, have you heard of myokines?
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.700]   - I have, but please educate us.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.460]   - So myokines are peptide hormones.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.680]   Again, skeletal muscles and endocrine organ
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.100]   that travel throughout the body.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:12.820]   The most famous one is interleukin-6.
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:15.420]   You have interleukin-15, interleukin-6.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:19.620]   These affect lipolysis.
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.700]   They affect the utilization of glucose.
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.540]   There's this idea of training in a low glycogen state
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.060]   that might increase a more robust amounts
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.060]   of these interleukins.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:28.900]   - Is that right?
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.740]   - These myokines, which is--
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:31.340]   - Great, 'cause I love training fast in the morning.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.300]   - Which is interesting.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.900]   And we always think about exercise
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.200]   as this way to improve metabolism.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.940]   It doesn't so much do that at rest,
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.900]   but what it does is when you exercise,
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.040]   you improve, again, glucose utilization,
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.500]   but also you release these myokines.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.520]   It's not just the physical activity,
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.900]   but it's also the subsequent effects
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:53.620]   and the subsequent molecules that skeletal muscle releases.
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:57.060]   - I just wanna say, realizing I'm interrupting,
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.220]   amen to that.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:00.800]   So often people look at how many calories were burned
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.380]   in a given bout of resistance training,
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:05.980]   and while that is perhaps interesting,
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.860]   the wavefront of other endocrine and molecular factors
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:11.940]   that set in motion by proper resistance training,
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.760]   to me is the most interesting and important aspect.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.640]   Meaning in the hours afterwards,
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.620]   sure, you're gonna continue to burn calories
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.700]   at an elevated rate,
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:24.140]   but it's all the effects of the hormones,
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:26.060]   and as you're pointing out, the interleukins
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:29.060]   that last hours and hours and even days
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:32.140]   that, at least to my mind or my read of the literature,
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:34.220]   are the most interesting, the most beneficial.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.060]   - It's fascinating,
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.780]   and actually the science is relatively new.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.780]   It came out of Pedersen's lab,
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.440]   Bente Pedersen in Copenhagen.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.560]   Extraordinary work.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.140]   She is in part an immunologist and exercise physiologist.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:50.780]   When you train and you release these myokines,
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:53.500]   which are based on the intensity and duration
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.780]   of your activity, release something called capsepsin B
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:01.620]   and irisin, these myokines then stimulate BDNF release
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.460]   in the brain.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.300]   - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.620]   - Exactly, which is a component of neurogenesis.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.220]   When we think about the plethora of activity
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.860]   of what skeletal muscle does,
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:15.260]   it is no surprise that number one, it's free to move.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:20.100]   - Can I just mention something about BDNF, if I may?
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.440]   I spent much of my earlier career
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.140]   working on neuroplasticity brain development,
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:26.540]   and BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.040]   gets mentioned from time to time,
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.220]   and as you mentioned,
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:31.540]   it's involved in different neurogenesis pathways
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:34.540]   and, but I think one of its most interesting effects
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:39.000]   is its role in consolidating existing connections,
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.900]   what we call synaptic connections in the brain.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.080]   And I'm so glad you mentioned this
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.820]   because what you're effectively saying
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:47.300]   is that doing resistance training properly
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:49.200]   sets in motion a molecular cascade
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:52.700]   that feeds back to a molecular cascade within the brain
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.300]   that reinforces the neural circuits that exist.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:56.580]   And one of the hallmarks of aging
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:01.060]   is essentially a degradation of neural circuitry,
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:03.100]   sometimes in extreme cases like Alzheimer's
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.500]   or other forms of dementia, Parkinson's, et cetera.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:09.700]   But we know that the volume of gray matter
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.940]   of neurons within the brain declines with age,
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.440]   we know that the neural circuitry suffers,
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:17.020]   the speed of neuronal transmission suffers,
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:18.740]   and it's long been observed,
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:21.620]   but only now objectively substantiated
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:24.320]   that exercise can not just maintain,
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.760]   but even improve brain function over time.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.040]   And so thank you for allowing me
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.060]   to kind of expand on what you just said.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:36.380]   I just think that if ever there was a potent medicine
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.980]   for improving brain health,
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:41.100]   it's exercise and in particular resistance exercise.
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.100]   I think that the case for cardiovascular exercise
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.060]   is probably that it maintains the components of blood flow
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:47.580]   that are also critical for the blood.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.220]   - Yes, and certainly no one is arguing
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:52.300]   the importance of cardiovascular activity and VO2 max.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.860]   We can appreciate that.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.260]   On the flip side of that,
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:57.880]   skeletal muscle has not had its moment yet,
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.060]   and in particular resistance training.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.180]   You're not going to be able to be effective
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:03.420]   at maintaining a VO2 max
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:05.580]   if you do not have healthy skeletal muscle.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.580]   You are not going to be able to be effective
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:12.300]   at nearly doing anything or surviving any kind of illness.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:15.700]   The higher the amount of skeletal muscle mass you have,
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.380]   the healthy skeletal muscle mass,
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:19.060]   the greater your survivability
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.340]   against nearly any kind of disease.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.180]   - Remarkable.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.180]   - For example, cancer cachexia,
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:25.980]   which is the wasting that comes with cancer,
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:28.200]   kills 20% of individuals.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.720]   Survivability comes from the health of skeletal muscle.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.120]   Also on that same note,
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.220]   contracting skeletal muscle, releasing myokines,
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.440]   interfaces with cells of the immune system.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.640]   We've all heard of macrophages and the cytokine storm,
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:47.640]   interleukin-15, TNF, TNF-alpha as being pro-inflammatory.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.080]   When the myokines,
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.920]   which are also interleukin-6 and interleukin-15,
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.760]   are released from skeletal muscle,
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.860]   they interplay and they somewhat dampen
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.080]   the inflammatory effect and have a different effect
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:05.720]   on the entirety of the system
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:10.400]   when these, quote, cytokines come from skeletal muscle.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.480]   - Incredible.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.480]   So as long as we are now on the topic of exercise,
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.680]   let's make it concrete for people.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.380]   We talked earlier about nutrition
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:20.340]   and specific gram amounts and calorie amounts
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.240]   and distribution, and that's just wonderful.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.760]   And thanks also for explaining the mechanism
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.200]   and the incentive for doing this.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.080]   Let's talk about resistance training.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.720]   And let's do this in a slightly different way
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.120]   than we did earlier.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:34.480]   What is your program for resistance training?
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.200]   And then we'll talk about
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.560]   what other people might consider for them.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.480]   And maybe the same thing.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:42.000]   So if you could just actually walk us through your week,
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.400]   what does it look like?
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.560]   It could be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, et cetera,
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.480]   or it could be how many days a week do you resistance train?
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.060]   - Of course, you know I don't do any kind of training.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.720]   - Yeah, well, I know based on your Instagram that you do,
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.440]   and now we know why.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.000]   - So I have a wonderful trainer, Carlos Mata,
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.120]   shout out to him.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.840]   Every Monday, I decide I don't wanna train.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.680]   And I know that-- - Really?
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.000]   - Of course. - You don't enjoy it?
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.960]   - I do, but it's usually suffering, at least Monday.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:12.360]   Every morning, I know Monday morning's gonna come up
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:13.680]   and I'm gonna think about all the ways
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.560]   in which I can get out of it.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.320]   I never get out of it, I always show up.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.760]   I train consistently three days a week,
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.560]   and I train pretty heavy for my size.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.020]   So I'm maybe 110 pounds.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:31.360]   What I do is I do some kind of push, pull,
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.280]   hinge, squat.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.960]   - On all three of those days? - I do.
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.160]   - So you train your whole body--
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.520]   - I do. - Three days a week,
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.160]   separated by a day in between?
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.600]   - I do, I do because essentially I'm working hard enough
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.960]   where I'm pretty exhausted.
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:47.460]   So I came here and you asked me if I trained this morning,
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:49.400]   Friday, I'm off today. - Okay.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.000]   - But what I do is when I start, I think about,
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.720]   well, actually Carlos thinks about this,
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.960]   but I'll do some kind of sled push.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.520]   Sled push, it will be loaded, it will be pretty heavy,
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.560]   it gets my full body moving,
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.560]   and then we'll pick some kind of compound movements,
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.320]   whether it's a-- - Multi-joint movement.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.480]   - That's exactly right, a multi-joint movement
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.800]   through full range of motion.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.320]   - So for instance, a squat or a deadlift?
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.360]   - That's right.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.400]   - If somebody isn't skilled in squats or deadlifts,
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.760]   could they maybe hold onto a kettlebell
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:19.880]   of appropriate weight for them
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.200]   and do like a kettlebell squat?
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.080]   - I'm gonna give them an even better solution.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.840]   And this is this concept that I learned
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.200]   from a PhD named Pat Davidson.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.800]   And he talks a lot about high ground, low ground movements.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.080]   And a high ground movement would be something
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.240]   where you have contact, contact like a hack squat.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.800]   So ground, you have back support, leg support,
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.540]   you are able to move in a way that fully contracts
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.560]   the muscle that you are focused on.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.720]   We see a lot of people that go to the gym
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.500]   and kind of just do whatever.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.980]   And that might be okay to maintain,
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.280]   but the goal should always be,
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.600]   ladies, you're not gonna get bulky,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.080]   should be hypertrophy.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:04.920]   - Which is hard to achieve as you mentioned.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.200]   - It is hard to achieve, but you must focus
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.060]   because maintaining and growing skeletal muscle mass
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:14.240]   as you age, it becomes much more challenging.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.320]   And so choosing high ground movements.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.320]   I would not have someone who is an unskilled lifter
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.960]   go in and do a front loaded goblet squat.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.920]   - Or a free weight squat or deadlift, right.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.240]   - I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.120]   I would have them do high ground movements.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:34.000]   And this is where machines are really, really wonderful.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.480]   People kind of will say, well, but you have to train
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:39.040]   for functional movement and functional.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:40.340]   Well, what is that?
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.920]   We're training for life.
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.840]   You're training for life durability.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.640]   - And if I may, anytime people say,
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.200]   what's the best form of exercise?
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.200]   How do you work out, et cetera?
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.320]   I always say rule number one, definitely train,
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.800]   but don't get hurt or avoid getting hurt.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.280]   I mean, the moment somebody approaches exercise
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.640]   and gets hurt, they're in trouble.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.680]   One of the best ways to get in shape for your entire life
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.440]   is to avoid getting injured, but still train.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.220]   - Or train your entire life.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:09.800]   If there are parents listening, thinking about your kids,
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:12.120]   there was a whole push where kids shouldn't do
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:14.000]   resistance training and shouldn't move load.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.240]   I look at my kids, they might not be doing one rep maxes,
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:18.360]   but they're picking up kettlebells.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:19.640]   They have, oh yeah.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.360]   - Yeah, I was told growing up to not touch the weights
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.400]   until I was at least 18.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.400]   At 16, I started doing pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups,
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.640]   and then pretty quickly moved into all the leg press,
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.920]   leg extension, all that stuff.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:35.740]   Couldn't help myself.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:39.560]   - But I would argue that outside normal play,
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.000]   someone is never too young to start
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.480]   and frankly, never too old.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.920]   - And body weight resistance is,
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.840]   in many cases, sufficient, right?
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.160]   I mean, as a kid, I would do, at night,
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.280]   I would do sit-ups and handstand push-ups against my door.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.080]   You know, I couldn't do a proper handstand unassisted,
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.040]   but I'd flip over and then do the handstand push-ups
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.080]   until my mom would yell at me about the marks on the door.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.440]   But you know, that was pretty tough, right?
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.420]   Getting 10 repetitions of that was pretty tough.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.600]   But you're saying resistance training,
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.560]   what you said, high ground.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.640]   - High ground, contact, high contact.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.040]   So when you are choosing motions
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:19.820]   that an individual is unskilled to do,
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:21.960]   I think, let's frame this,
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:25.220]   is that most people think about exercise
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.520]   for optimization and performance.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.760]   But if we take that back a notch,
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:33.760]   and you know, I think about my audience,
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.160]   and they are individuals that are,
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.280]   aside from the special operators and aside from the CEOs,
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.120]   they are 40-year-old women that are like,
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.080]   "Hey, all of a sudden I noticed
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.280]   "that my body composition has changed."
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.040]   You know, I work with an amazing PhD,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.560]   her name is Victoria Fleckhar,
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.400]   and she has helped me bring into these pieces
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.080]   of how do we design and think about training protocols
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.320]   and training programs for the more mature individual.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:05.180]   And when you think about these high ground movements,
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:07.440]   if someone has not trained,
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.860]   and they're thinking, "Well, I don't wanna fall,
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.480]   "so I'm gonna do box jumps."
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:13.320]   That plyometric movement,
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.460]   there's a high probability of injury.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.780]   - Yeah, I don't like box jumps.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:18.040]   - Or, no, I don't like them.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.920]   - I don't like them because the eccentric loading that,
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.800]   you know, it ends up being a lot of soreness,
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.720]   and it just takes a lot of them
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.680]   to generate what I'm trying to generate.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.160]   - So that is exactly the point.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.340]   Is an individual going to be able to generate enough force
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:33.760]   to make it meaningful?
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.520]   And someone would argue, "Yes."
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.480]   Well, for them, that would be,
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.840]   you know, when I was a practicing geriatrician,
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:41.460]   and I was going through my fellowship,
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.800]   we did a number of metrics to look at strength.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.800]   And one of those was a sit and stand out of a chair.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.960]   So sit to stand, and that would have,
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.960]   for some people,
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:56.260]   have been considered a high-intensity interval.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.420]   The question becomes,
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:01.200]   is that enough to mount a response over time?
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.920]   And I would argue, "No."
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.040]   What do people need to do?
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:08.120]   And that is when you train for hypertrophy,
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.640]   which is muscle growth,
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:13.800]   and let's say that is five to 10 reps,
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.620]   three, you know, four to five sets.
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.460]   You pick.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.300]   There's many different ways that it can be done.
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:18.900]   - Where the final repetitions are challenging.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.380]   - Where the load is enough.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.380]   And there's wonderful data out of McMaster University
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.500]   that it doesn't have to be heavyweight
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.620]   as long as the stimulus is enough.
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.600]   And then we take it back to what is the stimulus?
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.560]   And the stimulus, the goal should be,
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:33.980]   are you moving the muscles
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.380]   that you are supposed to be doing?
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:38.300]   And are you generating enough activity
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.040]   to create adaptation and change?
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.820]   And so a high-ground movement
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.200]   for someone who's listening to this
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:47.200]   and is thinking, "I need skeletal muscle health.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.040]   "I walk.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:48.880]   "Walking is wonderful,
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.640]   "but is walking enough to maintain those type two fibers?"
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.740]   It's not.
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.840]   You will see a transition,
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.740]   and we've all seen our aging parents.
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:59.960]   I mean, my dad is in his 70s.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.760]   He's very fit, but he used to be a collegiate wrestler.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:03.600]   He went to Wharton.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.900]   He was captain of his wrestling team.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:08.180]   Dad, you're a lot smaller.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:12.640]   And part of the reason is the failure
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.320]   to focus on hypertrophy,
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.240]   and those are those type two fibers,
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.200]   those type two fibers that transition with age
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:21.880]   to more type one fibers, those long, lean fibers.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.940]   You go from bigger to bulky to less.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.400]   Choosing activities to maintain those fibers.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.720]   Also, these fibers are bigger.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:31.280]   This is where glucose disposal goes.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.640]   Choosing things like leg extension.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.120]   It's not a bad thing.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:39.460]   If you get stronger and you have stronger muscles,
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.460]   then you will have more power.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.780]   You'll be able to generate more force.
[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:46.380]   You will be much less likely to fall.
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:50.400]   - And you'll be healthier overall because of muscle health.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.860]   So maybe we could just list off some of the movements
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:55.020]   that people could think about
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:56.660]   in terms of these high ground movements.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.380]   You mentioned hack squats.
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:52:59.660]   Leg presses come to mind.
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:00.820]   - Leg extension. - Leg extension.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.620]   Leg curls. - Leg curls.
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:04.860]   Lat pull-downs with a supported back.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:05.980]   Any kind of- - Rows.
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.340]   - Rows, a supported row.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:09.180]   Again-
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.460]   - These are mostly machine exercises
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.980]   that you're describing. - They are, they are,
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.660]   which is unusual. - Cables and machines.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:15.520]   - So cables would be considered low ground
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.220]   because you're kind of in space.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.100]   And if you think about it, what takes someone out,
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:22.660]   in their 40s, what takes someone out of the game?
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:23.820]   It's a tendon injury.
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:27.100]   Tendinopathies, whether it's a shoulder,
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.500]   whether it's a hamstring, whether it's a hip.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.660]   And part of the reason is there's muscular strength.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.180]   We focus on muscular strength.
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:37.860]   But there's also tendon strength, which takes time.
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:39.800]   And when you get tendinopathies,
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.620]   you get the thickening of these tissues,
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:46.220]   people will say that tendon lays down much slower,
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.820]   that the collagen turnover is much slower.
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:52.180]   But actually, muscle turns over 1% to 2% per day.
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:57.180]   Tendons turnover maybe 0.5% to 1.5% per day.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:54:00.680]   It's not that substantially slower.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:02.580]   It's highly active tissue.
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:03.780]   You need blood flow.
[01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:06.260]   You have to treat your body with respect
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.660]   that if you think you can always train the way
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:09.900]   that you did when you were younger
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:11.900]   and just hit those heavy weights,
[01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:13.500]   if you get injured,
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:16.980]   and you are not allowing your tendons to keep up,
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:19.960]   then overall injury over time,
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:21.460]   again, this is what we would call,
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.860]   maybe not a catabolic crises, but close.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:28.120]   - What is the total duration of a resistance training workout
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:30.380]   that the typical person could use?
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:32.740]   I make it a point to try and warm up
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.620]   over the course of about 10 to 15 minutes
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:38.820]   and then do 50 to 60 minutes of hard work.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:41.300]   But I always leave some gas in the tank.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:42.860]   It's the rare,
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:45.820]   I would say 5% of my total resistance training workouts.
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:47.140]   And I also train three times a week,
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:50.960]   although I divide my body up into different splits.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.880]   That's my case.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:52.720]   And I run three days.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:54.100]   - Well, you are much larger than me.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.320]   - Well, it's the case now
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.860]   that I try and hit each muscle group directly once per week
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.940]   and then indirectly another day per week.
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:04.500]   So if legs are on Monday, that's direct.
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.620]   But the indirect leg training
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.600]   is actually the HIIT workout on Friday, sprinting.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:09.440]   - I love that.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.260]   That's wonderful.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.940]   - I think that the three days per week whole body workout,
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.180]   I think would work for a lot of people
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.700]   just to take the complexity out of it.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:19.980]   So is it the case that the entire workout
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:23.300]   could be constrained to 45 to 60 minutes?
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:24.220]   - Absolutely.
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:27.060]   And for a new lifter, they're gonna get the most gains.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.560]   What we find is that if an individual
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.880]   is what we would consider a beginner,
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:36.880]   you will see after they go through a neurological adaptation
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:42.100]   is that they will get more growth
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:44.180]   and potentially progress.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.740]   A new lifter could progress weekly.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:47.880]   Whereas a more advanced lifter,
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:50.020]   I would say we would be considered more advanced.
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.620]   We've been lifting our whole lives.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.820]   That for us to make changes,
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:58.460]   it's much more challenging for us to put on size
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.620]   or even get stronger.
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.940]   I mean, yes, there is a particular cadence,
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:06.280]   but our improvements might be minute.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.380]   And when you're thinking about designing a program,
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:11.400]   the current recommendations for physical activity,
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.420]   which by the way, do you know 75, roughly 70,
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:17.020]   maybe it's 78% of individuals
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:19.880]   do not meet physical activity guidelines.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:20.940]   - And what are those again?
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.180]   5,000 steps per day?
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:25.140]   - 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:27.100]   with two days a week of resistance training.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:27.940]   - Per week?
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:28.760]   - Yeah.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:30.240]   - So 150 minutes.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.300]   - Total.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:32.400]   And two days a week of resistance training.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.700]   - Plus two days a week of resistance training.
[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:37.900]   - So that is what?
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:41.660]   30 minutes, seven days a week of activity.
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:42.940]   Just to put that into perspective,
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:45.060]   that is how sedentary we are.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:47.700]   50% of Americans are not even training.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.800]   - Is that true in other countries as well?
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.900]   - Well, I don't know the statistics in other countries,
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:56.240]   but far and away,
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:01.060]   we have arguably the biggest health crisis
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:03.620]   with our population.
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:05.340]   - People always point to the blue zones.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:07.340]   They say, well, in the blue zones,
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:09.560]   they have like a shot of vodka every night
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.840]   and they're socially connected
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.460]   and they have a Mediterranean diet
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.340]   and they're not lifting weights.
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:17.880]   But is it the case that they are piling wood?
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.140]   Are they walking more?
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.100]   - They're highly active.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:22.980]   Highly active.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:25.580]   And the blue zones are a funny thing
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:28.740]   because some will say,
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:33.740]   well, are the records kept appropriately and et cetera.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:37.420]   There is a lot though,
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:39.780]   despite that, that we can learn from the blue zones.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:44.620]   And I think again, connection, socialization,
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:47.020]   but also movement.
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:49.600]   Part of the reason why we are requiring
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:51.480]   this higher protein load
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.460]   is because we are physically less active.
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:56.180]   Again, there's only two main ways
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:57.460]   to stimulate skeletal muscle,
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:58:00.660]   resistance training and dietary protein.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:03.260]   Arguably, the resistance training piece,
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:06.740]   the physical activity piece is more influential,
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:10.940]   is much more impactful to full body homeostasis
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:12.780]   than diet will ever be.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:16.120]   If you just eat protein and don't exercise,
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:18.620]   you will likely still lose muscle.
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:19.580]   - Interesting.
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:23.340]   My observation of family friends
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:25.340]   that include people who are very fit
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:27.740]   into their 80s and 90s,
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:29.820]   and even beyond in a few cases,
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:32.140]   are that, and here,
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.500]   these are generalizations based on observation,
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.620]   I want to be clear,
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:38.420]   that the people I know
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:42.620]   who are still skiing in their 80s,
[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:44.820]   who are sprinting in their 80s,
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:46.660]   not as fast as they used to,
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:49.460]   who are still playing tennis in their 80s.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:50.380]   So what I'm referring to here
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:52.180]   are people that are playing sports
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:53.740]   that involve dynamic movement,
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.340]   that involve a lot of coordination,
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:57.720]   and no doubt some resistance,
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:59.740]   at least of some sort.
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:00.920]   Like skiing is, you know,
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.460]   there's some resistance involved,
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:03.780]   depending on the complexity
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:05.340]   of the slope, et cetera. - And trees, potentially.
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:06.180]   - Yeah, and trees.
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:08.060]   So what do you think is going on there?
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:09.580]   I mean, there's a rich literature
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:12.460]   to support the fact that most of our brain volume
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:15.020]   is there to support vision and movement,
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.220]   and that when we move less,
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.420]   there's brain atrophy.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:20.540]   John Rady at Harvard talked a lot about this,
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:21.900]   even some species of animals
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.940]   that will spend part of their life swimming around,
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:25.100]   and then they'll nest on a rock,
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.100]   and then the brain will actually eat itself
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:28.060]   due to the lack of movement.
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:31.020]   It will just metabolize portions of itself.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:32.540]   So the relationship between movement
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:36.180]   and brain health seems obvious.
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:40.620]   But yeah, how many folks do you see out there
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:45.180]   in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:46.900]   that are now doing resistance training?
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:48.380]   Do we know the percentages on that?
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:50.060]   - I don't, and I was just recently looking
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:51.820]   at the ACSM guidelines,
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:55.020]   which is the American College of Sports Medicine,
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:57.740]   for activity in older individuals.
[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:01.260]   I am not sure the percentage of individuals
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.620]   that are actually doing resistance training.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:07.100]   And partially, I'd have to believe that it's less.
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.700]   So again, I trained as a geriatrician,
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:12.180]   and one of the things that we always saw,
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:14.380]   not for everybody, but for the majority of people,
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:16.740]   is it wasn't the duration of the training.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.220]   They were still, if they were active,
[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.060]   they were still active.
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:22.620]   It was the intensity that they were able to mount.
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:25.740]   And so because, there's this interesting thing,
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:28.340]   is as we age, well, I mean,
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.980]   some of us are less intense in our training.
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:33.740]   And it's the actual intensity piece
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:37.620]   that seems to go down, that when this can be addressed,
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:39.540]   and what do I mean by intensity?
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:41.020]   There's a million ways in which
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:43.700]   I suppose one could define intensity.
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:47.460]   But it is pushing themselves, again,
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:51.540]   are we gonna say, is it how many reps, how heavy?
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:54.800]   But the focus and the intensity of the training goes down.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.500]   - I guess we could define intensity somewhat loosely,
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:01.660]   but still fairly by saying, repetitions in the,
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:04.980]   what, five to 10, maybe 12 repetition range,
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:07.980]   where the final two or three repetitions
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:12.100]   are challenging in good form, right?
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:14.340]   Maybe even to failure in good form.
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:16.200]   Does that seem like fair?
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.760]   - Yeah, and I would think of the intensity component,
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.700]   because the aging literature,
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:23.420]   it really doesn't seem to matter
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:25.980]   if people are lifting heavy or light.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:28.860]   I used to believe that in order to maintain
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:29.820]   skeletal muscle mass,
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:32.580]   especially as hormonal status changes,
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.740]   decrease in testosterone, decrease in estrogen,
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:36.100]   decrease in progesterone,
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:39.900]   that the heaviness of the load has to increase.
[02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:42.620]   I can't, the data doesn't necessarily support that.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:44.300]   I would love for that to be the case.
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.140]   - Surprising to me.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.480]   - It is surprising. - I would think people
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:49.560]   would have to push themselves with not extremely heavy loads,
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.560]   but moderately heavy for them.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.640]   - So it was surprising to me as well.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:56.400]   And especially when we worked on some of those earlier
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:58.560]   studies in Lehman's lab,
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.320]   there's this change in body composition
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.560]   that seems to happen midlife.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.320]   There's an increase in visceral body fat,
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.160]   or central adiposity.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:11.160]   And one would think that you require a lot of extra
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:15.860]   supplements, et cetera, to influence that.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.180]   But when training and nutrition are accounted for
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:21.000]   in a very controlled way,
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.140]   body composition changes to the positive.
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:26.860]   You can lose body fat and increase muscle mass.
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:29.620]   It'll be very interesting to see as the literature
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:32.180]   around hormone replacement continues to evolve,
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:34.500]   especially as it relates to women,
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:35.780]   because we know that testosterone
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:37.360]   improves skeletal muscle mass.
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:42.320]   But that isn't going to be enough
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:46.880]   if you don't have the foundation in place.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:48.460]   And I think that the other big concern
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:51.440]   is how we're measuring skeletal muscle mass.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:53.640]   We mentioned a little bit about DEXA.
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.800]   The more effective way is really MRI,
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:00.200]   which doesn't seem to be achievable for many people.
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.600]   It's expensive, and CT would be the other way
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:04.040]   to actually look at muscle quality.
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.280]   Muscle quality right now is defined purely
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:09.000]   on functional movement measurements,
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.800]   but that's clearly not it.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.680]   When we define, if you look in the literature,
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:15.920]   muscle quality is really about the load
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.380]   and the weight and the performance,
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.520]   not about the architecture and the infrastructure
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.000]   of the skeletal muscle.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.060]   And the reason I say this, let me take a step back,
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:26.580]   is that in the literature,
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:28.060]   and you will often hear people say
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:31.100]   that only strength matters, size doesn't matter.
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:33.820]   I don't believe that to be true.
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:35.180]   I believe that we haven't been able
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.640]   to test muscle size appropriately.
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.540]   And when we begin to test it, there's a way,
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:44.320]   and this is, I think this is being done,
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:48.260]   it came from a gentleman named Dr. William Evans,
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.980]   and he utilizes something called a D3 creatine,
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.220]   and it's a deuterated tagged creatine.
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:56.580]   And an individual will ingest a pill.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:59.860]   Creatine is largely in skeletal muscle.
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.240]   There may be a small amount in brain,
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:04.680]   but for the majority of skeletal muscle,
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:06.320]   that's where creatine goes.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.840]   And so this is a direct way, first time ever.
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.280]   It's been validated.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.720]   I think it started its utilization in maybe 2019.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:16.120]   But when individuals
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:19.320]   are directly measuring skeletal muscle mass,
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.760]   they find that skeletal muscle mass
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.660]   and strength are both important.
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:25.500]   - Interesting.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.940]   So is there a synergistic effect
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:31.900]   of ingesting quality protein in sufficient amounts
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.500]   distributed throughout the day,
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.340]   and as you mentioned,
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.700]   especially at the first and last meal of the day,
[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:40.340]   and resistance training exercise on muscle health
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:45.100]   and other metrics of longevity and current health status?
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.820]   - This is a bit of a nuanced answer.
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:49.900]   If you are young and you are eating
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:52.380]   close to one gram per pound ideal body weight,
[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:55.860]   then any time that you ingest your protein would be adequate.
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:58.980]   However, if you're older
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:03.140]   and you want to take advantage of resistance training
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:04.580]   plus dietary protein,
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:07.500]   then consuming within an hour or so,
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.200]   and again, that number is,
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.580]   the way in which I think about it
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:12.160]   is really about that blood flow,
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.380]   is how long that blood flow is still
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:16.640]   getting to the skeletal muscle
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:18.460]   because you're delivering nutrients.
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:21.540]   If you are older or have a chronic condition,
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.760]   then there would be no downside,
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:25.840]   and there is evidence in the literature,
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.340]   if you consume dietary protein around resistance training
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.820]   due to that synergistic effect,
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.920]   if you are eating a lower protein diet and/or older.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.620]   - Got it.
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:41.620]   So would it be actionable to try and,
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:43.300]   I don't know, drink a whey protein drink
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:45.260]   within an hour of resistance training
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:47.820]   or eating a meal that include a chicken breast
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.260]   or some eggs or a steak?
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:51.400]   Is that basically what we're talking about?
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.240]   - It is.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:55.140]   If you are eating a lower protein diet,
[02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:56.820]   I would take advantage of that
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:58.620]   because you increase the efficiency,
[02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:01.760]   you lower that anabolic resistance load.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:04.540]   Yes, one could do that,
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:06.940]   and I say this in a way that
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:09.180]   if you are young and healthy and you are training,
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.100]   I don't really care when you ingest your protein,
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:17.100]   but if you are a group or in a group of individuals
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:22.380]   that potentially is at risk,
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:24.860]   then doing resistance training
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:27.100]   and adding in dietary protein,
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:28.740]   I would say a shake is a great way to go
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:30.820]   because the absorption is quicker.
[02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:33.780]   A meal will have a slower absorption,
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:36.060]   and again, we need to get those amino acids
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:39.860]   into the bloodstream at a certain level at a certain time.
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:42.580]   - What about cardiovascular training, VO2 max?
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:44.400]   I make it a point to try and do a long hike
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.420]   or jog once a week.
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.300]   For me, that's 60 to 90 minutes.
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.260]   I'm not obsessive about it in the sense that
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.020]   sometimes I'll go out and I make it social
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:53.220]   with a weight vest or maybe just walk or hike.
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.900]   Sometimes I'll jog on my own.
[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:56.860]   One shorter run of 30 minutes or so
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.380]   in the middle of the week at a faster clip,
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:00.380]   and then one high-intensity interval training session
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:02.500]   that lasts about 12 minutes in total,
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:03.780]   and thank goodness it's only that
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:06.580]   'cause I'm basically sucking for air at the end.
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:09.220]   That's it for me, plus a bunch of walking if I can.
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.660]   I try to walk as much as possible throughout the day.
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:13.160]   I don't even consider that exercise.
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:14.000]   I just consider that movement.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:14.820]   - And that's wonderful.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.600]   Now you're talking about non-exercise activity.
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:21.660]   That is extremely valuable.
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:23.460]   - Yeah, I try to pace while I take phone calls
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:26.540]   and things of that sort, as much movement as possible.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:30.220]   What is the value of getting the heart rate elevated
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:34.660]   for some period of time longer than a few minutes?
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:37.280]   - Yeah, I mean, when you're talking about increasing VO2max,
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:40.440]   I think that there's a multitude of ways to do it.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:44.040]   One could do slow steady-state activity,
[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:46.580]   but I will say, as individuals age,
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.060]   that becomes more challenging on joints.
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:50.420]   We are thinking about how are we able
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.620]   to maintain our physicality throughout life.
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:56.420]   If you have got a ton of time
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:00.100]   and you can do slow steady-state, it's wonderful.
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.120]   Alternatively, there's a lot of evidence
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:04.840]   that high-intensity interval training,
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:06.660]   Martin Gabbala would be a wonderful guest.
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:09.540]   He is really the expert in high-intensity interval training
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:14.540]   and it's changes in insulin sensitivity,
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:17.000]   influence on VO2max,
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.060]   and this is really going all out in a matter of 20 seconds.
[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.920]   There's moderate-intensity interval training,
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:26.160]   high-intensity interval training, sprint interval training.
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:27.940]   That will increase VO2max
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:30.440]   in a substantially less amount of time
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.860]   and could be safer for an individual.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:37.840]   The other way is improving skeletal muscle mass.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:40.020]   If you improve strength and hypertrophy,
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:41.940]   you will improve your VO2max,
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:44.260]   albeit not exactly in the same way,
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:47.320]   but both are beneficial and both will improve VO2max
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:49.900]   and blood pressure and triglycerides
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:53.200]   and clinical outcomes that we care about.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:58.200]   It's wonderful to think about things kind of nebulously
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:01.040]   and then it all comes back to
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:02.840]   what do we care about as we age?
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:05.600]   We care about having an appropriate blood pressure.
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.480]   Let's call it 120 over 80.
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:09.240]   We care about having a triglyceride level
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:11.600]   of 100 or less, lower.
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:15.420]   We care about maintaining fasting insulin levels,
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:17.100]   fasting glucose levels,
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:21.780]   anywhere the cutoff they will say is between 70 to 100.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:24.660]   These are clinical outcomes that we care about
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:28.940]   and that is what we ultimately want.
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:33.540]   However, the influence is to pull those levers to get there
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:35.600]   can be varied.
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.100]   It ultimately comes with how are we going to do it
[02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:41.460]   and how is it going to be something that we maintain?
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:45.280]   There's certain aspects about dietary protein
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:46.520]   that are interesting.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.040]   One of the things that I've seen clinically
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.600]   is that those individuals that are on a higher protein diet
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.160]   will seem to have higher blood glucose.
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:55.920]   I don't know exactly why this is.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:57.000]   It's thought that maybe because
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.480]   the red blood cells live longer.
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:01.540]   - And maybe also higher blood creatinine levels.
[02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:04.000]   - We do see higher blood creatinine levels
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.060]   when individuals have higher muscle mass.
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:08.240]   That is typically a call that I get.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.180]   Many of my patients are large and buff, as I would say,
[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:15.740]   and they almost all have higher levels of creatinine.
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:18.100]   That doesn't mean that your kidney function is suffering.
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.100]   One thing that one would do clinically
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:24.600]   would get a cystatin C to correct and get a corrected GFR
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.700]   to see if it's within the normal range.
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:29.020]   - Is it true that if you do a hard resistance training
[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:31.340]   session and then get your blood drawn the next day
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:34.340]   that you might see higher blood creatinine levels?
[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:35.740]   - Potentially, but what I have seen
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:37.900]   are higher ALT and liver enzymes.
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:39.220]   And we see that very frequently
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:41.420]   in individuals that train intensely.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:43.300]   - And it concerns you or doesn't concern you?
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:44.140]   - It doesn't concern me.
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:45.820]   - Right, 'cause it's just a consequence of the training
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:47.380]   and presumably it's transient.
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:49.260]   - It is transient, typically.
[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:52.840]   And we may see changes in creatinine with,
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:55.680]   I have one patient, she runs 100 miles.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:57.740]   - Oh goodness. - She's in her 60s.
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:58.780]   - She's an ultra runner?
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.820]   - Yeah, in her 60s.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:02.200]   And she's strong, I mean, she's stronger than me.
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.220]   It's extraordinary.
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:05.600]   And you think about what are the things
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.400]   that she needs to do to maintain the health
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:10.920]   of her muscle mass so that she can continue
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:12.840]   for long periods of time.
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:15.720]   - So while we both agree that nutrition
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:17.480]   is one of the foundations of muscle health
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.240]   and health generally,
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.140]   supplements often can have their place.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:24.720]   We talked a little bit about creatine.
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:27.540]   I and many other people supplement with five to 10 grams
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:29.640]   of creatine monohydrate per day.
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.280]   I do that because it has benefits for muscle strength.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.480]   There's some brain benefits that I'm aware of.
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.880]   And I realize, and now you've reinforced the idea
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:40.280]   that it's difficult to get enough creatine,
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.800]   even if one is ingesting the threshold amount
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.860]   of one gram of protein per ideal body weight.
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:50.800]   What are your thoughts on creatine monohydrate
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.860]   and what other supplements do you recommend
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:56.040]   for your typical client, excuse me, patient?
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:56.880]   - Yeah, certainly.
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.520]   So creatine monohydrate is wonderful.
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.600]   And particularly we're seeing a lot of benefits in women,
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.800]   post-menopausal women and older populations.
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:07.920]   Creatine, for sure.
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:10.400]   The other supplement is urolithin A.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.240]   Urolithin A is a postbiotic made from the gut microbiome.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:16.720]   And there's a percentage of people that can make it
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:19.160]   and the majority of individuals cannot make it.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:20.000]   - Interesting.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.000]   - Urolithin A is this connection, which I find fascinating.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.380]   It's a gut muscle connection.
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.120]   Individuals that take urolithin A,
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:29.640]   I happen to be one of them,
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:34.000]   there are many papers out there that it improves mitophagy,
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.040]   which is the health of mitochondria,
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.840]   the turnover of mitochondria,
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.200]   helps with the renewal of mitochondria.
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:43.920]   But what's so fascinating is there are trials
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.080]   in human individuals
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:48.360]   that it increases strength and endurance.
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.200]   - Interesting.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:52.320]   What milligram doses do you recommend?
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:55.720]   - So I take between 500 and 1,000 of urolithin A.
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:58.960]   Really, I wish that I had actually created this
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:12:59.960]   or found this out.
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:01.560]   Truly, if I could make one supplement-
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:02.400]   - That's a bold statement.
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:03.280]   - I know.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:05.840]   I would probably make a mix of urolithin A
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:07.400]   with creatine and some whey protein
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:11.280]   and maybe 25 milligrams of collagen.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:13.280]   And I would have my perfect supplement.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.680]   - Is it taken with food or without food?
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:16.680]   - It doesn't matter.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:17.920]   - Interesting. Morning or night?
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:18.840]   - It also doesn't matter.
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.800]   What's so interesting about urolithin A
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.160]   is that it comes from, again, it's made in the gut,
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:25.120]   from the gut microbiome,
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:27.240]   from things like pomegranate or walnut.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:29.760]   It's made from something called an elagitannin.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:32.760]   And it is really, again,
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:35.120]   what I think of as this gut muscle connection,
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:37.680]   which I do believe is going to be the next frontier.
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.520]   - So interesting.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.760]   I recall a few studies that Dr. Andy Galpin
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.840]   put on his social media.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:45.160]   These were in mice, mind you,
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.840]   but looking at how disruption of the gut microbiome
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.520]   could offset some of the strength
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.440]   and hypertrophy increases of resistance training,
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:56.840]   pointing to the fact that having a healthy gut microbiome
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.400]   is critical for translating resistance training
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:02.520]   into actual improvements in muscle health.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.560]   - Yes. And one of the things that we do see
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.400]   is that as individuals increase their activity,
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.520]   talking about more endurance type running,
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.720]   there's this very interesting inflection point.
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:15.200]   There's this idea of optimal performance.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:19.280]   And then there is this kind of moment
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.000]   where optimal performance, depending on the training load,
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.880]   starts to take a toll on health and wellness.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:25.480]   I think that we see that.
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:27.560]   And with that, one of the things that we always see
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:30.920]   is impaired gut lining, impaired gut integrity.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:33.880]   The gap junctions seem to open,
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.440]   whether it's the training volume
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:37.480]   and the physiological stress.
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:41.360]   That can easily be measured with zonulin or calprotectin.
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:42.480]   Stool samples do this,
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:46.080]   but doing things that actually help the gut,
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.320]   not just the gut microbiome,
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:51.720]   but the gut integrity is extremely important.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:52.560]   - Very interesting.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:53.840]   What other supplements?
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:57.600]   And maybe we should put whey protein in here as well.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.080]   - Yes, whey protein.
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:02.360]   It's interesting, whey protein and whey protein concentrate
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:04.720]   has alpha-lactalbumin and lactoferrin
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:07.920]   and these immunoglobulins that can be very beneficial.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:09.320]   Whey protein, it's interesting.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:12.160]   We talk a lot about how processed foods are negative,
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.080]   but the reality is that processed foods
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.520]   aren't positive or negative.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:19.720]   The highly palatable processed foods that are full of sugar,
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:22.240]   we can all agree maybe those are not ideal,
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:26.360]   but whey protein concentrate or whey protein isolate,
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:27.960]   those are both processed.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:32.920]   However, it is a great way to get your essential amino acids
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:35.760]   which are amino acids that you must get from the diet.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.520]   Your body cannot make them.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.760]   There has been a lot of research with whey protein,
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:42.960]   has very little downside and it's easily tolerated.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:45.480]   Those that have challenges with lactose
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:49.660]   can use the whey protein isolate versus the concentrate.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.520]   - And it's very portable if one is traveling
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:53.680]   and things of that sort.
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.560]   - And if one has a child,
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.840]   please make sure that you use a lid
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:00.200]   of very tight for the powder.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:01.640]   Otherwise you will be wearing it,
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:04.280]   your child will be wearing it is a bit of a disaster,
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.120]   but yes.
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:05.960]   - Noted.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.800]   What about other supplements,
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:10.360]   including fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids?
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:12.120]   - There's a lot of research around that.
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:13.960]   And I think that it's a positive.
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.660]   It's not only a positive for brain function,
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:19.040]   but it seems to have a unique anabolic effect.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:23.240]   Maybe it is in, you know, potentially from on the ribosomes.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:25.460]   We're not sure, at least I'm not sure at this time,
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:28.000]   but there seems to be even more emerging evidence
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.640]   that it may even impact women differently.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.960]   Again, I can't say that in all certainty,
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:37.320]   but nearly all of my patients are on some form of fish oil.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.440]   - Is there a threshold amount?
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:41.140]   - That is a wonderful question.
[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:44.580]   There is not, the general recommendation
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:45.800]   is around four grams,
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:47.640]   but some individuals four to 10 grams,
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:49.560]   which would be definitely on the higher end,
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:52.920]   certainly can potentially thin your blood.
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:56.240]   If an individual is going for surgery two weeks prior,
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.560]   would suggest not taking it.
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:16:59.840]   But where it becomes very interesting,
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:03.680]   it's really the combination of omega-3 to omega-6
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:05.080]   and understanding there's ways
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:06.320]   in which you can test in your blood.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.640]   We run this blood work all the time,
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:10.600]   looking at whether it's an omega quant or an omega,
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:12.400]   an omega index can be very valuable,
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.940]   but it is a very easy supplement to take.
[02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:19.000]   And it seems to be very beneficial for brain health
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.520]   and even muscle health.
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:24.920]   - I find it to be most affordable to take it in liquid form.
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:28.320]   Just take a tablespoon of the lemon flavored fish oil,
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:30.040]   put it in a protein drink or something,
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.760]   then you don't taste the fishiness
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:35.440]   and then capsules for convenience when traveling
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:36.440]   and things of that sort.
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:39.480]   But the liquid forms are so much more affordable
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:41.560]   in order to hit that two grams a day,
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:43.000]   or, you know, in this case-
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.740]   - Two to four, yeah, two to four grams.
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:47.820]   Again, this also depends on the absorption
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:48.660]   for the individual.
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:50.400]   That's why it's really important to do blood work.
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.060]   I have some patients that require closer to six grams
[02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:58.920]   to be able to improve their omega-3 to six ratio.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.860]   And it certainly is, there's that precision nutrition
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:03.580]   where the amount for one person
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:06.300]   is not necessarily the amount for another.
[02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:07.580]   - Interesting.
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:09.340]   What other supplements do you take?
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:12.220]   - I think, let me think about what other supplements
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:13.580]   that I personally take.
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.800]   Collagen, I love collagen.
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:20.620]   Collagen in my coffee, collagen coffee,
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:21.460]   I love strong coffee.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.140]   If you've never had it, it's amazing.
[02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:24.300]   Collagen- - It's called strong coffee.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:25.420]   - It's called strong coffee.
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:27.900]   It has collagen, it has L-theanine in it,
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:29.260]   really helps with the jitters.
[02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:30.860]   There's some good evidence with L-theanine
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:32.460]   to help with anxiety.
[02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:34.020]   But collagen is interesting.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:38.060]   Collagen is a, I say protein, it's not really,
[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:40.020]   it has a protein score of zero.
[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:42.460]   It does nothing to affect skeletal muscle mass.
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:44.300]   It is devoid in tryptophan,
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:46.700]   and it is very low in the branch chain amino acids,
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:51.060]   but it is high in glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline,
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:53.620]   which makes it very unique in structure.
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:58.620]   It is also very difficult to test the effect on tendons,
[02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:02.580]   collagen protein on tendons, because as you can imagine,
[02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:05.080]   one would not want a tendon biopsy.
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:07.060]   - Right, sounds painful. - It sounds painful.
[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:09.140]   - Muscle biopsies are painful.
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:11.040]   - Yes, you know, I used to do a lot of those
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:12.260]   when I was in my fellowship.
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:14.980]   It was probably less painful for me
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:16.180]   than it was for the subjects, but--
[02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:18.340]   - I can imagine, yeah, it's like taking a small quirk
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:20.040]   of tissue out of the muscle. - Yes.
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.920]   So collagen protein, I think, can be very beneficial
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:26.660]   for skin, hair, and nails.
[02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:30.180]   I feel as if we just haven't gotten sensitive enough
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.300]   to determine its effect on tissue yet.
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:39.300]   I anticipate that higher doses above 15 grams
[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:40.620]   may be of some benefit.
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:42.460]   I'm just speculating, but I'm guessing
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:44.980]   that it's probably closer to 25 grams,
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:46.620]   and I know that that seems a bit robust,
[02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:50.660]   so in one scoop might have 15 grams,
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:54.460]   but I think there's no negative to increasing collagen,
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:56.180]   and quite frankly, we don't get a lot of collagen
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:57.100]   in our diet.
[02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:58.740]   The places in which you would find collagen
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:00.420]   are the gristle in meats, or--
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:01.940]   - But in broth. - Yeah.
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:03.580]   That's another great way to increase it.
[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:06.120]   - So you take it once a day? - I do.
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:07.260]   - Particular time of day?
[02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:08.580]   In the coffee, in the morning? - I take it in the morning,
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:10.980]   so my coffee has collagen in it.
[02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:12.380]   Sometimes I'll add-- - Before you train?
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.580]   - Before I train, yes, I do,
[02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:15.660]   and I typically train fasted aside from that,
[02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:17.700]   and then I'll add in an additional scoop.
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:20.460]   - You mentioned fasted.
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:23.560]   Maybe we should touch on fasting for a moment.
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:27.220]   I inadvertently have been doing intermittent fasting
[02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:30.440]   for years, meaning I was never hungry for breakfast,
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:33.460]   so my first meal lands at 11 a.m. or so,
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:35.940]   plus or minus an hour on most days.
[02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:37.500]   There are exceptions to that.
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:42.500]   Last meal typically, I don't know, 8 p.m.,
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:44.220]   7 p.m., sometimes 9 p.m.
[02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:46.020]   I'm not super strict about that,
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:50.100]   and it basically boils down to anywhere from two
[02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:55.100]   to four "meals" per day, a lunch, a dinner,
[02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:58.220]   and then some eating in between.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:02.420]   Could you first comment on that architecture of eating,
[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:05.620]   but maybe first on fasting specifically?
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:07.460]   I mean, what are the benefits or detriments
[02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:12.460]   to having a feeding window of about eight or nine hours,
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:13.940]   regardless of where it lands in the day,
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.820]   and then let's talk about how that might slide around
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:18.880]   or if people should ensure getting more food coverage
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:19.860]   throughout the day.
[02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:22.460]   - Two benefits that I find from fasting.
[02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:24.540]   Number one, calorie restriction.
[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.500]   Number two, bowel rest.
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:30.440]   Many individuals have gastrointestinal challenges.
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:32.780]   When they are in a time-restricted window,
[02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:34.700]   they are not feeding all day long.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:35.540]   - Great point.
[02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:37.980]   - Those are the two benefits that I often see.
[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:41.500]   An individual who is older or struggling to put on muscle,
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:44.740]   fasting would not be my primary go-to.
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:46.620]   I think that as individuals age,
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:49.740]   there's a bit of a negative
[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:53.140]   because you have to balance this muscle protein synthesis.
[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:58.140]   They're always going through a synthesis and a catabolism,
[02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:02.040]   so an anabolic process and a catabolic process.
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:03.600]   As you age, it becomes more difficult
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:04.840]   to regulate that process,
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:07.400]   and if you add in additional fasting,
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:08.600]   go through long periods of time
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:10.360]   where, let's say you're not training,
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.520]   you're not protecting skeletal tissue,
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:13.360]   that would be a place
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.500]   where I don't necessarily recommend fasting.
[02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:18.360]   - Some people might find it difficult
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:23.360]   to hit the 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal frequency
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:27.080]   across the day in order to reach that one gram of protein
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:29.140]   per pound of ideal body weight.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.700]   If they were going to add a meal,
[02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:34.320]   or let's just say add 30 to 50 grams of protein,
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.060]   how much time separation do they need from the other meals?
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:40.780]   So for instance, if I were to take a step back and say,
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.820]   "Okay, you know, I need an additional 30 to 50 gram
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:45.460]   "protein intake per day
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:48.640]   "in order to maintain the muscle I have as I age,"
[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:51.180]   and I am aging, as we all are, I suppose.
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:55.620]   "Is two hours before my 11 a.m. meal enough?
[02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:57.120]   "Does it have to be three hours?
[02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:58.380]   "Could it be one hour?"
[02:22:58.380 --> 02:22:59.980]   I mean, you can only assimilate
[02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:02.540]   and then oxidize a certain amount of protein.
[02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.540]   I mean, how much time window does one need
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:06.420]   between these protein feedings?
[02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:07.620]   - I appreciate that question.
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:09.060]   And here's my answer to that.
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:13.060]   The first meal of the day is the meal that has been studied.
[02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:14.980]   The remainder meals, to my knowledge,
[02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:18.260]   there is no study that shows anything
[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:19.700]   about the second or the third meal.
[02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:22.520]   And perhaps that's because of the difficulty.
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:25.640]   But the literature suggests that that first meal of the day,
[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:26.660]   whenever you're gonna have it,
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:28.400]   let's say for you it's 11,
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:30.760]   eating 30 to 50 grams of protein,
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:34.840]   the muscle protein synthetic response will last two hours.
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:36.640]   However, when we talked about mTOR,
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:39.600]   there's other initiation factors like EIF-4.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:44.520]   That will maintain itself for another four to five hours.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:45.360]   - I see.
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:48.760]   - Therefore, the second meal
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:50.920]   is really not necessarily
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:53.660]   a muscle protein synthetic response.
[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:55.980]   I can't say that that's supported in the literature,
[02:23:55.980 --> 02:23:57.800]   but where the benefit of that is,
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:02.160]   is that we know that more than one meal
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:04.760]   of that robust amount of protein
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:06.480]   will likely have better outcomes
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.480]   on this 24-hour protein response, 24-hour nitrogen balance.
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:13.080]   But that second meal
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:15.280]   would be just about getting your protein in.
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:17.280]   It doesn't matter if it's,
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:19.600]   you know, if you have to hit your need
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:21.520]   of say 200 grams of protein,
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:22.400]   then that middle meal,
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:25.040]   the real goal for that metabolically
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:26.680]   is to get enough protein
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:29.560]   to meet that one gram per pound ideal body weight.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:30.400]   - I see.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:33.760]   - And then that final meal before you go into a fast
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:35.880]   would be what we would say
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:38.960]   would support overnight protein synthesis.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:41.280]   I mean, not necessarily support overnight protein synthesis,
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:44.720]   but in the fasted state, your body pulls from muscle.
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:47.640]   It has to maintain the energy balance
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:50.160]   for all other systems in the body.
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:53.440]   All other tissues, again, 25% of protein turnover
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:55.200]   goes to skeletal muscle
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.900]   and the rest goes to other organ systems.
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:24:59.720]   For you or for hypertrophy,
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:03.120]   adding an additional meal would again,
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:05.480]   let's say four meals I think would be,
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:08.380]   if I were to design a diet in the perfect world
[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:10.000]   to support hypertrophy,
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000]   I would add another, a fourth meal.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.240]   - Well, I love to eat.
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:17.140]   So that's not a problem in principle.
[02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:22.100]   This is probably getting a bit more toward the aficionados,
[02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:26.600]   but I've heard that certain forms of animal protein
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:28.600]   and other proteins are more beneficial
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:29.520]   at certain times of day.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:32.580]   For instance, meat and eggs early in the day,
[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:34.420]   maybe chicken and fish in the middle of the day,
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:36.260]   and that casein and milk proteins
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:39.920]   might be more advantageous for muscle health
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:42.480]   in the final meal of the day or closer to bedtime.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:44.400]   I realize this is getting into the details,
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.520]   but I'm sure a percentage of our listeners
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:47.760]   would be curious to do that.
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:50.480]   And of course, milk proteins always make me sleepy,
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:52.160]   so it kind of fits.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.360]   - You know, it's really interesting.
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:55.520]   I will say that milk protein casein
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:57.320]   seems to be slower absorbing
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:02.000]   and that's because of the impact with the gut, obviously.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.580]   But is there anything special about casein or milk protein?
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:07.160]   The answer to that would actually be no,
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:09.320]   but the length of time that it takes
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:10.520]   for digestion absorption,
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:12.320]   maybe where the benefit comes in,
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.480]   that being said, there's some data to support
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:16.600]   high saturated fat dairy, believe it or not,
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:20.080]   actually can be good for health and longevity.
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.200]   I know that people will say high saturated fat
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:25.360]   or high fat dairy would be negative,
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:26.880]   but I would say that there is evidence
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.200]   to support it being health promoting.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:34.200]   - Well, nothing like a piece of terrific cheese,
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:39.200]   like a Parmesan or a shot of full fat cream.
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.040]   - And I will mention the Lucy.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.360]   - Which I love every once in a while.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:43.400]   That's a guilty pleasure,
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:46.640]   a shot of full fat cream with equal part espresso.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:49.280]   - I'll take it, I'll take it.
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.160]   I will mention that the leucine content
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:56.160]   in milk protein is a little bit lower or say Greek yogurt.
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:01.080]   - Are there any sort of cryptic champion proteins?
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:02.680]   You know, I think most of us think, okay,
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:07.680]   steak and ground beef and maybe venison and elk and eggs
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:10.000]   and all the obvious things, chicken, fish, et cetera.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.440]   But are there any kind of cryptic proteins out there
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:16.360]   that are particularly good for us
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:18.120]   in terms of their amino acid content
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:19.200]   that people don't think of?
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:20.440]   You hear these days about liver.
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:21.280]   I frankly don't like the taste of liver.
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:22.360]   - I don't like liver,
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:25.640]   but liver has a lot of other benefits to it.
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:28.720]   So it's high in fat soluble vitamins and iron,
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:32.280]   very bioavailable, but I'm not, it's very difficult to eat.
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:35.200]   - Yeah, I think people either love it or hate it.
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:37.080]   I'm on the second category.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:39.440]   So no proteins come to mind.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:41.560]   Is salmon a quality protein?
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:43.640]   - Salmon is a quality protein, is higher in fat.
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:45.680]   Again, calorie balance does matter.
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:46.520]   Fish is interesting.
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:49.480]   Fish has five grams of protein per one ounce
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:52.760]   versus meat has on average seven grams,
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.400]   seven or eight, red meat has seven or eight grams
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.240]   of protein per one ounce.
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:59.700]   - So interesting, you know, this idea that, you know,
[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:03.760]   eating muscle can support the health of muscle.
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.600]   - It makes sense though, doesn't it?
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:05.920]   - Yeah, it makes perfect sense.
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:09.360]   And you've explained very clearly as to why that is.
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:13.160]   Okay, we set aside liver for this conversation.
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:16.240]   - Some people are into cricket and maybe there is-
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.960]   - Sorry, I apologize to the, well, not to the crickets.
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:21.600]   The crickets probably thanked me for my response,
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.800]   but I'm not judging.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:25.320]   It's just my personal visceral response.
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:28.240]   Other people may like insect proteins,
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:30.480]   but what about other organ meats, heart?
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:33.600]   I know, I mean, around the world,
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:36.400]   you see the consumption of lots of different organ meats.
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:39.880]   Is there any evidence that heart is a good protein
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:42.480]   or are we generally looking at skeletal muscle
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:45.280]   as the best source of amino acids?
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:47.720]   - Heart is also a good source of protein.
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.760]   It's also high in CoQ10, which is good for muscle health.
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.240]   But many people, again, we don't seem to eat that.
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:58.760]   However, other places eat the full animal.
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:00.680]   But they're all good sources of protein,
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.720]   aside from collagen,
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:04.240]   which would be that protein score of zero.
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:08.200]   - And if somebody insists on being vegan or vegetarian,
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:12.240]   let's just say vegan, what are their best options?
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:14.720]   - There are rice-pea blends of protein,
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:16.880]   which are absolutely suitable.
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:19.200]   There are a lot of now fermented types
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:21.320]   of protein powders out there
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:23.520]   that seem to have the same profile as whey.
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:27.000]   The one thing that I would say as individuals age,
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.840]   a vegan diet can be very challenging.
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.320]   Need to make sure that you are getting enough B12,
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:36.360]   zinc, iron, nutrients of concern
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.440]   that seem to be going down in general.
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:43.000]   We're seeing decreases of that in the general population.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.440]   - What are your thoughts on magnesium?
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:46.400]   We sometimes hear that-- - Yes, it can be excellent.
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:48.380]   - People are magnesium deficient
[02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:50.400]   based on depletion of the soil.
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:53.640]   You hear this stuff, but what's the story with magnesium?
[02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:54.480]   - That is true.
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:29:58.480]   There seems to be less magnesium in the diet.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.640]   Very easy to supplement,
[02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:01.360]   whether the form that you use,
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:04.240]   whether you use a magnesium glycinate
[02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:08.000]   or there's a whole host of magnesium citrate
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.400]   for gastrointestinal health, whatever it is.
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:12.920]   But yes, magnesium supplementation
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:16.400]   can be very beneficial for muscle, for brain.
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:21.040]   - Do you support the idea of supplementing with zinc
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:23.160]   or is that something that is kind of,
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:24.240]   sometimes yes, sometimes no?
[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:26.760]   - I think if you're eating a whole foods diet,
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:29.560]   you're going to be unlikely to be deficient in zinc.
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:30.400]   Zinc is interesting
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:32.840]   because you don't want to supplement zinc without copper.
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:34.480]   There is a zinc-copper ratio
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:37.200]   that is well-maintained in the body.
[02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:39.280]   Supplementation with one or the other
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.160]   will typically deplete the other.
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:45.520]   And as a geriatrician, there's a zinc-copper ratio,
[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:48.640]   things that we think of as kind of proxies
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:50.520]   for overall brain health.
[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:53.000]   Not saying that the zinc-copper ratio is the only thing,
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.160]   but certainly supplementing with one or the other,
[02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:00.520]   one would be careful.
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:02.600]   - What are some things that people might be doing
[02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:07.160]   or taking that inadvertently disrupt muscle health
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:10.360]   and perhaps even hypertrophy?
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:13.680]   - One thing that people often use is ibuprofen.
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:16.280]   And ibuprofen, while not inherently bad,
[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:17.600]   there's some evidence to suggest
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:21.120]   that higher doses of ibuprofen can impact muscle health,
[02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:23.480]   whether it's hypertrophy or strength.
[02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:25.640]   I often think about those together,
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:28.480]   but ibuprofen use, it's also not good
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:30.960]   for the gastric lining.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:33.800]   Again, you have to be able to absorb your nutrients
[02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:36.280]   to be able to become strong and healthy.
[02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:38.640]   The other thing is obviously statin use.
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:40.000]   Some people do need statins.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.060]   I'm not saying that we shouldn't,
[02:31:41.060 --> 02:31:42.800]   but that can certainly affect muscle health.
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:47.160]   A side effect can be muscle pain, myalgia, muscle soreness.
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:48.840]   It can deplete CoQ10.
[02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:51.880]   - Is occasional use of these things okay?
[02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:54.000]   - Yeah, of course, and obviously check with your doctor.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.840]   But things that suppress inflammation
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:32:01.280]   like aspirin potentially or other NSAIDs can,
[02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:03.960]   well, aspirin is in a category of its own,
[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:08.440]   but NSAIDs in particular seem to suppress skeletal muscle
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:12.300]   at certain doses, hypertrophy potentially and strength.
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:15.880]   The other thing is fluoroquinolones.
[02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:19.760]   They are antibiotics that can affect collagen
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:21.480]   and tendon turnover.
[02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:24.020]   If an individual is on a fluoroquinolone,
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:25.320]   there's a risk for,
[02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:27.440]   you hear a lot about these Achilles injuries.
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:29.160]   - Yeah, which sorts of antibiotics?
[02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.880]   I think, is it like Cipro and things like that?
[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:34.000]   People can injure themselves badly.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.440]   - You should be certainly careful about the activity
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:37.680]   that you're doing at the time.
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:39.760]   The other thing is the proton pump inhibitors.
[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:43.000]   People use that for stomach acid or reflux.
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.640]   That can affect absorption of vitamins and minerals
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:49.240]   that do have long-lasting effects.
[02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:53.560]   - What are your thoughts on the GLP-1 analogs,
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:55.560]   Ozempic, Monjaro?
[02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:57.320]   Real quick anecdote.
[02:32:57.320 --> 02:32:59.520]   I was in New York City.
[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:03.120]   I was walking up the Upper East Side on a Sunday recently,
[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:06.320]   and there was a sign outside a store that said,
[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:08.680]   "We carry Ozempic and Monjaro."
[02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:10.520]   And I thought the sign would say,
[02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:13.520]   like, we have ginger lattes or something.
[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:14.760]   And I thought, well, that's good.
[02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:15.640]   I snapped a photo of it.
[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:16.820]   I didn't think much of it at the time.
[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:19.320]   And then I decided to post it to my Instagram
[02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:21.560]   thinking that there'd be a few opinions.
[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:23.440]   And frankly, I was just curious what people would think.
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:25.200]   So I said, "What do you think?"
[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:27.800]   And it was one of the largest responses
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:30.400]   in terms of comment volume and contentiousness
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:32.440]   that I'd ever observed.
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:34.520]   And I thought, whoa, there's really something here.
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:37.680]   My understanding is that these compounds,
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:40.720]   which are becoming incredibly popular,
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:41.840]   can help people lose weight,
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:43.480]   but that there's some loss of muscle,
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:44.720]   maybe even some bone mass.
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:46.480]   Correct me if I'm wrong on that.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:48.600]   But I would also imagine, excuse me,
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:51.640]   that some of the muscle loss
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:53.320]   can be offset by resistance training,
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:56.360]   maybe even protein intake and resistance training.
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:58.760]   So what is your thought about these compounds?
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:02.200]   Last thing, I'll just give a little bit of my stance.
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:03.240]   I know a number of people
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:05.880]   that had extreme struggles losing weight.
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:07.960]   I don't know the extent to which
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:09.120]   they were doing things correctly
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:10.680]   or incorrectly with nutrition.
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:12.600]   It's not my place to probe into that,
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:15.560]   but that they got on these compounds, one or the other,
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:17.440]   and seemed to love them
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:19.680]   because it got them kind of out the gate,
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:21.720]   20, 30 pound weight loss very quickly
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:25.160]   without intense cravings, their appetite is suppressed.
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.480]   And many of them are now also exercising
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:28.600]   and doing other things.
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.400]   So I don't think we wanna look at this
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:32.440]   or talk about this as an either/or,
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:36.640]   ozempic, manjaro, or exercise and proper nutrition.
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:37.920]   I would imagine there's a place for both,
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:39.640]   but I'd love your take on these.
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:41.400]   - I would love to share it.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:43.800]   These medications are...
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:46.000]   It's complex.
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.680]   The issue of obesity, the challenge with GLP-1s
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:54.640]   and dual agonists like Mongerno GLP-1 and GIPs,
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:56.880]   it is a complex conversation.
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:00.680]   So the opinion that I'm gonna give is going to be,
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:02.280]   while I give my opinion,
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:04.520]   I recognize that this is certainly,
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:06.440]   like you said, very heated.
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:09.080]   There's a couple of ways to look at it.
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.080]   First of all, nothing has worked more effectively
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:18.640]   other than bariatric surgery than these medications
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:20.480]   to affect obesity.
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:23.360]   So a GLP-1 agonist like ozempic will,
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:27.160]   an individual might get a 13% weight loss.
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:28.080]   - In how long?
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:30.800]   - That's a good question. - A couple months or so?
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:34.680]   - Yeah, so it's a titration.
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:36.480]   It's a monthly titration.
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:41.320]   But over a period of 24 weeks, it certainly depends.
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:42.800]   - Significant.
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:44.800]   - Yeah, it certainly depends on the individual,
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:49.000]   but it's utilized and increased month by month
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.120]   at a four-week span.
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:55.440]   The other aspect is the dual agonist
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:57.600]   like Mongerno trizepatide.
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:02.600]   And that will potentially cause a 22% weight loss.
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:06.880]   The challenge with obesity is real.
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:08.480]   Now, I have taken care of patients
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:10.520]   that have deeply suffered with this,
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:13.120]   whether it is a component of food addiction
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:16.840]   or whether it is a component of whatever the reason.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:18.600]   We have used these in clinic
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:21.680]   and it has transformed their lives.
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:24.680]   I would never take that away from somebody.
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:26.640]   Certainly it is personal choice.
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.840]   Now, the other aspects of these,
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.480]   the comment about skeletal muscle loss, I have seen that.
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.480]   And again, we use these medications in our practice.
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:40.480]   And with a proper nutrition plan
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:42.960]   and proper resistance training,
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:45.640]   I do not see a loss of skeletal muscle mass.
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:49.200]   You have to work with a provider that can help titrate it.
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:51.800]   But I think that these drugs can be used
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:53.320]   in a very safe manner.
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:57.520]   And we see improvements in alcohol consumption,
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:59.440]   in other addictions.
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:00.280]   - Very interesting.
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:02.320]   - There are a whole host of benefits
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:04.120]   from these medications.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.640]   Now, I think where people get upset is they say,
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:09.720]   "Well, is this a shortcut?
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:11.000]   "Can you go off of them?
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.600]   "Do you have to regain that weight?"
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:16.000]   And again, we have many patients that go off of them
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.080]   and have implemented great strategies
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:21.280]   for training and nutrition and we don't see weight gain.
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:22.120]   - Interesting.
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:26.640]   - It all depends on a comprehensive holistic view.
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:28.960]   And that becomes important to recognize.
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:32.120]   There are many benefits and people will say
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:35.920]   the negatives would be slowing down gastric emptying.
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:37.320]   Well, I would say yes,
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:40.240]   and that's exactly what the medication is designed to do.
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:42.800]   There may be some risk with pancreatitis.
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:46.520]   There is some discussion about thyroid cancer
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:48.080]   in rodent models.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.600]   Rodents have a different thyroid
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:55.080]   and volume of thyroid receptors than humans.
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:57.800]   I think that potentially that is incidental.
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:00.080]   I'm sure that we'll be hearing more and more about it.
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:02.920]   These medications also are not new.
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:06.800]   They have been used for over a decade.
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:10.800]   And those are all important points to recognize
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:13.400]   that now it is very popular,
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:16.680]   but these medications have been around for quite some time.
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:19.120]   - It is interesting that some of the peptides
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.800]   like GLP-1 analogs that have existed
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.120]   in somewhat niche communities for a while,
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:26.520]   so including things like
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:29.520]   in the melanocyte-stimulating hormone community
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:31.640]   that are now sold under FDA approval
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:35.360]   for things like low libido,
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:37.240]   things like Vilece.
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:40.360]   - And Addy, we were mentioning Addy for women,
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:42.800]   for hyposexual desire disorder.
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:45.040]   - Right, I don't know the history of Addy,
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:50.040]   but certainly the alpha-melanocyte-stimulating
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:52.880]   hormone-related peptides, the GLP-1 peptides,
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:53.880]   things like Sermorellin,
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:55.480]   which are in the growth hormone secretagogues,
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:57.080]   all were viewed for a long time
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:59.400]   as kind of niche community, fitness community,
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.600]   but now at least the GLP-1 analogs
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:06.600]   have made their way into, I mean, massive scale use,
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:08.680]   which speaks to kind of a general theme
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:11.400]   of what I've observed over the last,
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:13.720]   well, I'm 48 now, but let's just say 35 years,
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.360]   which is that many of the things
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.840]   that exist in niche communities become mainstream.
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:22.480]   It just takes some time and they become mainstream
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:25.160]   through the standard channels of FDA approval,
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:27.760]   which as is the case with Ozempic and Mondrano.
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:30.600]   So it's great to hear that you embrace sort of both sides.
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:32.420]   Like a lot of what you've talked about today,
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:34.520]   I think one wouldn't necessarily find
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:36.160]   in the kind of standard tables
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:39.240]   or what's on a poster in the doctor's office,
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:40.240]   but some of it is,
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:42.080]   and you really are at the intersection
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.920]   of both those landscapes.
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.960]   - Thank you, and this idea of Ozempic
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:51.080]   and triseptide, these GLP-1s,
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:52.960]   we talked a lot about protein.
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:55.400]   And one way that it has a satiating effect
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:59.640]   is this GLP-1 stimulation.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:02.740]   And one has to recognize that these GLP agonists,
[02:40:02.740 --> 02:40:05.200]   these GLP-1 agonists last for a week.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:08.960]   The dietary protein effect is a meal to meal.
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:11.240]   - So eating protein increases GLP-1,
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:13.280]   as does drinking yerba mate tea,
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.720]   but probably to a lesser degree and more transiently.
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:16.820]   - More transiently.
[02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:20.000]   And I think that that is just an important
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.240]   and interesting fact.
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.000]   And the other fact is that the amount necessary
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.800]   to stimulate muscle protein synthesis,
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:28.660]   the amount for muscle health,
[02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:32.880]   is also seen in the amount of GLP-1 released.
[02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:33.720]   - Interesting.
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:38.720]   - It seems as if that 30 to 40 or so gram amount
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:42.120]   of high quality protein is the same amount
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:46.040]   that has a meaningful impact on the release of GLP-1.
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:47.120]   - Very interesting.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:49.100]   I did not know that.
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:51.240]   So if we were to just back away
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:53.000]   from everything we've talked about,
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:58.960]   what are the top level benefits of having healthy muscle?
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:00.280]   - Everything.
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:01.280]   (both laughing)
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:02.120]   - Okay.
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:04.240]   - Muscle is the organ of longevity.
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:07.720]   And when we think about lifespan,
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:08.920]   we think about healthspan,
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:11.440]   and then we finally think about muscle span.
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:16.040]   I would argue that that is right after lifespan.
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:19.140]   The benefits of healthy muscle cannot be denied.
[02:41:19.140 --> 02:41:22.180]   This is better metabolic health,
[02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:23.780]   better blood pressure,
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:25.820]   better survivability,
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:27.020]   better strength,
[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:28.540]   better mobility,
[02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:30.580]   better body armor.
[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:31.700]   Should someone fall,
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:33.220]   should someone get sick,
[02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:35.180]   your survivability will be related
[02:41:35.180 --> 02:41:37.100]   to the health of skeletal muscle.
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:39.460]   And especially as we think about aging,
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:41.020]   if we wanna have good skin,
[02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:45.820]   or we think about wanting to have a good looking body,
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:47.480]   even though I can appreciate
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:50.820]   it's only a small amount aesthetic,
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:52.440]   but leveraging the aesthetic
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:54.780]   to have healthy brain function,
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:57.960]   there's this idea that Alzheimer's
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:41:59.480]   or certain types of dementia
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:01.280]   are type three diabetes of the brain.
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:04.880]   Skeletal muscle is the only organ system
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:07.440]   we have voluntary control over.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:10.400]   It is the only endocrine organ system
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:12.120]   we have voluntary control over,
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:15.120]   which means we have a responsibility to leverage it.
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:18.460]   - We've talked about these in a lot of detail today,
[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:21.160]   meaning you've educated us about these in detail today,
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:22.000]   and thank you.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.720]   But perhaps you could summarize
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:27.240]   what you view as the top nutrition-based tools
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:29.640]   for improving muscle health.
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.340]   - Number one, dietary protein.
[02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:36.740]   And that would be in terms of a protein hierarchy,
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:39.140]   roughly one gram per pound ideal body weight.
[02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:40.660]   An individual could certainly go
[02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:43.540]   to 0.7 grams per pound ideal body weight.
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:47.660]   The higher the protein, the less it matters the quality,
[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:49.220]   whether it is a high quality protein
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:50.540]   or a lower quality protein,
[02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:53.140]   the total protein amount matters.
[02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:55.180]   That is at the base of the pyramid.
[02:42:55.180 --> 02:42:57.620]   The next would be the,
[02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:00.540]   I would say the quality,
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:02.780]   understanding the quality of the protein
[02:43:02.780 --> 02:43:04.880]   so that you know exactly how much,
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:07.060]   and then certainly the distribution
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:09.780]   of how you are ingesting this protein.
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:13.380]   The dietary protein habits
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:16.580]   of someone who is eating a more protein-forward diet,
[02:43:16.580 --> 02:43:19.660]   distribution will matter less the higher it is,
[02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:23.180]   but there is certainly some great importance
[02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:25.280]   depending on if you are older,
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:31.700]   challenging for any kind of health and wellness challenges.
[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:33.340]   This is what I would say.
[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:35.860]   - And I realize it will vary depending on activity,
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:38.840]   but assuming that somebody gets the one gram
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:41.940]   of quality protein per pound of ideal body weight,
[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:44.820]   how should they make up the rest of their caloric needs?
[02:43:44.820 --> 02:43:47.500]   - The next I would say would be your choice.
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:49.740]   You choose, carbohydrates or fat.
[02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:53.340]   There's evidence that carbohydrates are helpful
[02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:55.100]   from a fiber perspective,
[02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:57.580]   phytonutrients, other vitamins and minerals.
[02:43:57.580 --> 02:43:58.740]   I certainly would go there.
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:43:59.700]   That would be my preference.
[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:01.720]   The amount of activity that you do
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:03.820]   certainly could use carbohydrates.
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:04.980]   And then fat.
[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:07.540]   It is very easy to get essential fatty acids.
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:10.820]   Your diet doesn't have to be too high in fat to get that.
[02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:14.400]   But at the end of the day, prioritize dietary protein.
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:15.940]   The next level would be understanding
[02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:17.820]   your carbohydrate threshold.
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:20.580]   Could start at 130 grams, titrate up or down,
[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:23.540]   depending on your metabolic health and/or activity.
[02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:25.660]   Understanding that outside of activity,
[02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:29.860]   50 grams or less of carbohydrates would be a threshold
[02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:32.780]   to mitigate substantial insulin response.
[02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:34.940]   Finally, that fat, you can choose
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:36.700]   however you would like to get that fat.
[02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:38.420]   Typically comes within a meal.
[02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:42.740]   And that would be the remainders of your caloric intake.
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:46.380]   - And what are your top line tools
[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:50.260]   with respect to exercise as it relates to muscle health?
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:52.220]   - Resistance training is non-negotiable.
[02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:55.500]   It doesn't matter if you need to start with body weight,
[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:56.980]   absolutely okay.
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:44:58.680]   Move to bands.
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:02.340]   Definitely moving load is valuable and non-negotiable.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:04.020]   Start with two days a week.
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:05.800]   You will likely progress to three days a week
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:07.380]   if you're doing three days a week.
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:10.220]   Again, it all depends on the volume and intensity
[02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:11.820]   in which you are working under,
[02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:14.740]   depending on whether it's five to 10 sets,
[02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:17.280]   how many reps you're doing.
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:19.180]   I think that there's many ways
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:20.700]   in which one could do it right.
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:22.820]   The only way in which someone could do it wrong
[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:25.300]   is to not do it, quite frankly.
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:26.760]   That would be what I would say for that.
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:28.920]   And then adding in high-intensity interval training.
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:31.020]   I would choose high-intensity interval training
[02:45:31.020 --> 02:45:33.300]   over slow, steady-state cardio
[02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:35.900]   because the high-intensity intervals seem to have
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:39.980]   a very impactful effect
[02:45:39.980 --> 02:45:44.020]   with the low amount of time that it takes.
[02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:45.060]   - Let's talk about something
[02:45:45.060 --> 02:45:48.820]   that might seem somewhat distant
[02:45:48.820 --> 02:45:50.340]   from everything else we've talked about,
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.940]   but I actually believe is central to all of this,
[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:54.900]   which is mindset.
[02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:58.740]   The psychology around health and self-directed health,
[02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:01.420]   which of course includes communication and cooperation
[02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:04.780]   from licensed trained physicians like yourself.
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:07.900]   You know, what's your mindset and recommended mindset
[02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:10.220]   around muscle health and just general health
[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:12.660]   in terms of healthspan and lifespan?
[02:46:12.660 --> 02:46:15.640]   - What you're talking about here is muscle span
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:18.820]   and the way in which the cognitive processes
[02:46:18.820 --> 02:46:20.460]   and the way that we think about our life,
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:23.660]   how does that influence what we actually do?
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:26.860]   And I could give someone the perfect plan
[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:29.100]   and it doesn't matter if I give an individual
[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:32.260]   a perfect plan if they're not willing to execute on it.
[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:34.740]   I've been a physician for 20 years, believe it or not,
[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:36.480]   that is a long period of time.
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:38.540]   And I would say a good physician
[02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:41.580]   is a physician that identifies patterns of diseases,
[02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:43.020]   patterns of illness.
[02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:44.860]   But an effective physician
[02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:47.780]   is someone who identifies patterns of people.
[02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:50.580]   Because once you identify the pattern of the person,
[02:46:50.580 --> 02:46:52.300]   you're able to leverage that
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:55.100]   so that they can get the best out of themselves.
[02:46:55.100 --> 02:46:57.900]   And there's a few core fundamental principles
[02:46:57.900 --> 02:47:01.440]   that people have to recognize if they want to be well.
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:04.340]   And that is you set standards
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:06.140]   and you don't set goals.
[02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:08.140]   People will set a weight loss goal
[02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:10.420]   or a muscle hypertrophy goal.
[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:13.080]   But if you set a standard for how you operate
[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:14.800]   and how you execute,
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:17.140]   you know that regardless of how you feel,
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:18.660]   you're gonna get up and train.
[02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:22.620]   You know that this is going to be your nutrition plan.
[02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:23.580]   You get up and you do it.
[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:25.700]   You set a standard and that standard
[02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:27.840]   provides a framework for execution.
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:30.160]   - I love that.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.920]   I sometimes think of the non-negotiables of the week
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:38.680]   that unless I'm suffering from a really bad cold or flu,
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:40.680]   which fortunately for me is pretty rare,
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:42.520]   that I'm gonna get
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:44.300]   those three resistance training sessions in.
[02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:47.760]   I'm going to try and get as much quality sleep as I can
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:50.720]   and I'll get those cardiovascular training sessions in.
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:52.520]   When you talk about setting standards,
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:54.520]   is that what you're referring to?
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:56.080]   Are you talking about blood work standards?
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.120]   Are you talking about aggressively trying
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.680]   to maintain blood values in a particular range?
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:06.120]   Or are you mainly talking about behaviors?
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:08.120]   - I'm talking about both.
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:10.220]   Yes, should there be a standard for your blood work
[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:11.060]   that you're getting?
[02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:12.980]   Yes, we have a very strict standard
[02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:15.820]   that we have in place for all our patients.
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:18.900]   However, the framework for which they execute
[02:48:18.900 --> 02:48:21.800]   is all about the standards that they place for themselves.
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:24.600]   'Cause ultimately what we want here, Andrew,
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:26.280]   is we want people to get results.
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:28.600]   And the only way they're going to get results
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:31.760]   is if they stop chasing these goals.
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:33.760]   And that might be counterintuitive to people
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:34.600]   because people will say,
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:36.440]   "Well, I'm gonna set a weight loss goal."
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:38.580]   Goals come and go.
[02:48:38.580 --> 02:48:40.720]   Standards remain.
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:44.600]   And if you fail to do the practical in your life,
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:47.960]   the practical becomes impossible.
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:50.200]   And that's why we set standards.
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:52.400]   The other aspect is an individual
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:55.120]   has to understand where they fail.
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:58.120]   I take care of a lot of very successful entrepreneurs
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:00.360]   and just individuals.
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:02.480]   They all know where they fail.
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:05.380]   They all know their points of weakness.
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:09.280]   Over time, it's not understanding where you excel
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:11.820]   because quite frankly, that's the easy part.
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:13.520]   The part that becomes very valuable
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:14.680]   is you know where you fail.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:16.480]   You know where your points of vulnerability are.
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:18.000]   You know where you fall off track.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.600]   I'll give you an example.
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:23.460]   Typically, when someone is about to do something amazing,
[02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:25.680]   they have this, but you know this better than anyone,
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:27.560]   this dopamine high.
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.200]   At that pinnacle seems to be a place of vulnerability,
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.960]   whether they will skip a training session
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:38.720]   or buy another car or do whatever it is that they do,
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:39.980]   eat more cake.
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:42.760]   They have an experience in their environment
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:45.820]   where they're at the pinnacle of what they are doing.
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:47.480]   That is a place of vulnerability
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:50.320]   where people will fall off health track.
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:53.860]   On the same token, at the moment after
[02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:56.220]   the big successful moment,
[02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:59.920]   I have a patient who puts on a massive event in Vegas
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:01.760]   and every year I wait for the call
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:03.680]   that he's feeling depressed
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:08.680]   because his dopamine didn't go back to baseline
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:11.640]   or fall to baseline, it went below baseline.
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:13.120]   What becomes important to recognize
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:15.520]   is that this is another point of vulnerability.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:17.480]   At this point of vulnerability
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:22.120]   is where people seem to go off track
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:23.900]   and never regain their footing
[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:26.000]   if they do not recognize that.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:27.160]   And so I can appreciate
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:28.500]   that we're talking about mindset here
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:30.760]   because there's a level of neutrality
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:34.140]   that is necessary for overall success.
[02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:37.440]   Again, this is what I've seen time and time again,
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:39.040]   that those that are the healthiest
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:41.440]   are able to maintain this level of neutrality.
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:43.120]   - Tell me more about level of neutrality.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.360]   I'm right there with you on setting standards
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:46.180]   instead of goals.
[02:50:46.180 --> 02:50:47.720]   And I'll say, I've never thought about it in this way,
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:50.080]   but I absolutely love that.
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:52.200]   And for the record, you said it
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:55.120]   and I'm gonna blast it out credit to you
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:57.340]   as much as possible because I think it's so critical
[02:50:57.340 --> 02:51:01.440]   for persistent engagement in the kinds of behaviors
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:03.840]   and mindsets that lead to success over time.
[02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:08.580]   So love this standards over goals principle,
[02:51:08.580 --> 02:51:11.080]   knowing where one fails, points of vulnerability,
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:14.680]   beautiful concept, painful to hear
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:17.360]   because of the realistic nature of it.
[02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:18.880]   And that's exactly why it's potent.
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:19.720]   So thank you for that as well.
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:21.360]   - And predictable. - And predictable.
[02:51:21.360 --> 02:51:24.280]   - Human beings are predictable in their behaviors.
[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:26.600]   And it's for example, on Friday night,
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:28.880]   when everyone tells themselves they're not gonna have
[02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:30.800]   that drink and that pizza and that cookie,
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:33.080]   and then Friday night comes around
[02:51:33.080 --> 02:51:36.040]   and they're surprised by their own humanness.
[02:51:36.040 --> 02:51:37.480]   And again, what we're looking for
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:40.580]   are long-term strategies for overall health.
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:43.360]   Because that wave of youth does close.
[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:46.040]   And while we can all continue to get better,
[02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:49.160]   as that window compresses, it becomes much more important
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:53.340]   to be very diligent on the responsibilities
[02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:55.920]   to our health, our nervous system,
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:51:58.000]   so that we can continue on for success.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.340]   It's just the way that it is.
[02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:03.280]   - Tell me about the neutrality component.
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:05.240]   - This is fascinating.
[02:52:05.240 --> 02:52:08.200]   And I have a very good friend, his name is Ben Newman,
[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:11.640]   and he really highlighted this for me.
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:14.700]   And he works with a lot of these sports teams.
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:17.480]   And he was the first patient that helped me
[02:52:17.480 --> 02:52:20.920]   put together this idea of neutrality.
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:21.960]   I'll give you an example.
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:24.600]   He was flying to work with one NFL team,
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:26.160]   I think that they were going to the Super Bowl,
[02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:27.520]   something major.
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:29.520]   And I said to him, "How are you doing?
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:31.080]   "You just came off of your book launch,
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:34.080]   "and just before this, you were at another NFL team."
[02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:35.520]   And he says to me, he goes, "Gabrielle,
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:37.580]   "it's just another Tuesday.
[02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:40.220]   "It's just another Tuesday."
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:43.540]   And so this idea of neutrality is that
[02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:48.300]   when you can manage and mitigate your emotional ebbs
[02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:51.940]   and flows for when things are at their high,
[02:52:51.940 --> 02:52:53.620]   the excitement, this isn't to celebrate
[02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:55.180]   or not to celebrate.
[02:52:55.180 --> 02:52:57.900]   But when you begin to mitigate these ebbs and flows,
[02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:00.660]   it's almost as if there's this level of neutrality.
[02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:03.220]   When that happens, these big moments,
[02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:05.420]   because life is full of big moments.
[02:53:05.420 --> 02:53:07.020]   Yes, it's full of small moments,
[02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:09.380]   but it certainly is full of these big moments.
[02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:12.960]   And it's these big moments that once we enter into,
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:17.500]   if one is not neutral, then being able to pick themselves up
[02:53:17.500 --> 02:53:19.740]   from an experience or a moment
[02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:21.400]   become much more challenging.
[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:22.980]   My most successful patients,
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:24.220]   I'm not talking about financially,
[02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:27.220]   I'm talking about the ones that are able to maintain
[02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:30.840]   and contain their health are the ones that are neutral.
[02:53:30.840 --> 02:53:34.460]   - In terms of tone and affect?
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:37.120]   - No, in terms of experience.
[02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:39.580]   As they go through life, they celebrate some wins,
[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:41.140]   they don't celebrate others.
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:44.420]   - Very consistent with some of the theories
[02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:47.260]   that I and a few others in the science community
[02:53:47.260 --> 02:53:49.900]   have expounded around dopamine regulation.
[02:53:49.900 --> 02:53:51.520]   - It makes a lot of sense.
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:55.580]   And where I care about this is as a physician
[02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:56.900]   who takes care of people
[02:53:56.900 --> 02:54:01.900]   and when they cannot manage this emotional highs and lows,
[02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:03.420]   because as you think about it,
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:05.460]   if you walk around and you feel that everything is stressful,
[02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:07.240]   I mean, you've got your cortisol going,
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:11.560]   then you're not sleeping, and it becomes this cycle.
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.060]   And then that cycle becomes a habit.
[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:18.500]   And if one can teach themselves to be steady,
[02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:20.420]   for example, going into a big workout,
[02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:24.900]   maybe they mitigate the anticipation of that workout.
[02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:28.300]   They're much more likely to continue on that way.
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:32.340]   And what is so important about it is a trainable skill.
[02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:35.440]   - Sounds like it's a lot about energy conservation.
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:36.280]   - Yes.
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:38.020]   - Mental energy, not just caloric energy.
[02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:38.860]   - Yes, yes.
[02:54:38.860 --> 02:54:39.700]   - Very interesting.
[02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:40.900]   - And so then you can do the things that matter
[02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:42.740]   and then you don't fall off the bandwagon
[02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:46.560]   because it just seems that each time a person does it,
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:47.980]   they become better at doing that.
[02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:51.160]   It is hard to hear, I think probably for many people,
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:52.940]   but it's very predictable.
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:55.700]   And if you can leverage that predictable nature,
[02:54:55.700 --> 02:54:57.660]   for example, that Friday night that comes along
[02:54:57.660 --> 02:55:00.540]   and you've told yourself that this is going to be
[02:55:00.540 --> 02:55:03.740]   your last beer or your last pizza,
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:06.140]   then you know how to engage in it.
[02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:08.460]   You come up with a game plan where you've set a standard,
[02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:10.480]   where this is the thing that you do Friday night.
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.500]   You set the rule and the foundation for your actions.
[02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:17.220]   - While hearing about your stance on mindset,
[02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:19.100]   standards, goals, knowing where one fails,
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:22.260]   points of vulnerability and neutrality.
[02:55:22.260 --> 02:55:23.100]   - I have one more.
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:24.000]   - Oh, please.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.940]   - This one is a big one.
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:30.660]   And this is, a person will only ever be as healthy
[02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:31.960]   as they feel worthy of.
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:34.140]   - Tell me more.
[02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:37.580]   - That when individuals do not feel worthy
[02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:39.780]   of having health and wellness,
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:44.540]   they will sabotage themselves over and over and over again.
[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:46.420]   And it is something really important
[02:55:46.420 --> 02:55:48.060]   when you sit down with a patient
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:50.720]   or you reflect on yourself.
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:55.380]   The question becomes, do you feel worthy of being healthy?
[02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:59.480]   Do you truly feel worthy of having the body that you desire,
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:03.160]   of having that overall sense of vitality?
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:05.700]   Because if someone doesn't,
[02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:08.560]   they will use that as a distraction.
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:09.980]   They will sabotage themselves
[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:14.140]   and they will focus on the not feeling well,
[02:56:14.140 --> 02:56:19.140]   the feeling tired, all of the other physical aspects
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:21.700]   that go along with ill health.
[02:56:21.700 --> 02:56:24.140]   And that will allow them a distraction.
[02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:29.620]   - I once read something about a person who was obese,
[02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:32.260]   who then got in shape.
[02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:35.880]   And they were reporting that in their family growing up,
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:39.740]   they had a narrative around exercise
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:43.660]   that for them translated to exercise
[02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:46.740]   being a form of extreme selfishness.
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:47.840]   And that surprised me.
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:51.560]   I thought, what better thing to do
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:53.420]   in terms of helping one's health
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:56.600]   and helping therefore the relationships in your life
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:00.740]   by segmenting out a small, not a huge portion of one's day,
[02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:02.980]   but an hour a day to take great care of oneself
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:06.060]   and ensure health so that you don't have to be dependent
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:08.920]   on others in a way that would be burdensome to them,
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:13.700]   perhaps earlier in life than it would be in any other case.
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:17.180]   So this seems to fit very well with what you're saying.
[02:57:17.180 --> 02:57:21.100]   This person obviously felt that exercise was selfish
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:23.100]   and they weren't worthy somehow
[02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:25.380]   of being healthy and in shape.
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:27.060]   Fortunately, they flipped the script on this.
[02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:31.060]   And I should say that was over, goodness, that was 2016.
[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:32.260]   So it's been a long while
[02:57:32.260 --> 02:57:35.340]   and they have maintained good health and staying in shape.
[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:36.700]   They set a standard for themselves.
[02:57:36.700 --> 02:57:37.580]   - Isn't that amazing?
[02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:38.400]   - It's awesome.
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:39.240]   - It's awesome to see.
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:40.740]   It's also been awesome to see their transformation
[02:57:40.740 --> 02:57:43.540]   and their psychology and the different aspects of their life.
[02:57:43.540 --> 02:57:46.120]   But is that something that you see a lot,
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:48.900]   that people just feel like getting in shape
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:52.140]   or paying attention to what they eat is somehow selfish?
[02:57:52.140 --> 02:57:55.320]   - I think that some people
[02:57:55.320 --> 02:57:58.780]   do not feel worthy of feeling good.
[02:57:58.780 --> 02:58:02.180]   And they will sabotage themselves
[02:58:02.180 --> 02:58:05.100]   until they uncover that, number one,
[02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:07.900]   that is the message that they're sending themselves.
[02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:11.140]   And once they do that, there is a bit of friction.
[02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:14.920]   And we know in order to be successful in any game plan,
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:16.500]   that friction is required.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:20.200]   And on the other side of friction is quite frankly, freedom.
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:24.160]   But those individuals have to understand
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:26.440]   that they are worthy and really do that work.
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:28.880]   But yes, time and time again,
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:31.660]   it is one of the first questions that I ask.
[02:58:31.660 --> 02:58:34.060]   Do you feel worthy of feeling good?
[02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:35.980]   - Well, Dr. Gabrielle Lyon,
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:40.980]   you have given us an incredible tour of muscle.
[02:58:40.980 --> 02:58:43.780]   And in fact, an entirely new perspective,
[02:58:43.780 --> 02:58:46.840]   even for me on how muscle impacts our health.
[02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:49.340]   As we talked about at the beginning,
[02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:51.700]   so often when people hear about the importance of muscle,
[02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:53.660]   they think just building muscle.
[02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:55.260]   And that tends to separate people
[02:58:55.260 --> 02:58:56.660]   into those who want to build muscle
[02:58:56.660 --> 02:58:58.580]   and those who don't or think that they can't
[02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:00.900]   or don't really understand what it's about.
[02:59:00.900 --> 02:59:03.220]   But you've made oh so clear,
[02:59:03.220 --> 02:59:05.200]   the fact that muscle is a critical,
[02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:08.620]   perhaps the most critical aspect
[02:59:08.620 --> 02:59:11.940]   of maintaining health and longevity of the body,
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:15.460]   of the brain, of health span, lifespan,
[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:16.860]   what you call muscle span,
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:18.660]   really seems to wick out into everything
[02:59:18.660 --> 02:59:20.060]   in terms of our wellbeing.
[02:59:20.060 --> 02:59:22.720]   And you've given us a ton of actionable tools
[02:59:22.720 --> 02:59:26.420]   at the level of nutrition, at the level of exercise,
[02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:28.220]   at the level of supplementation,
[02:59:28.220 --> 02:59:31.300]   and thankfully also at the level of mindset.
[02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:33.220]   I think the tools that you shared
[02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:36.640]   along the lines of mindset are absolutely spectacular
[02:59:36.640 --> 02:59:39.320]   as are all these other recommendations.
[02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:41.720]   So I want to say on behalf of myself
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:44.360]   and everyone listening and or watching,
[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:46.720]   thank you for sharing all of this information with us
[02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:49.320]   in such clear and actionable detail.
[02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:51.060]   Thank you also for the work you do,
[02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:52.760]   for being such a pioneer
[02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:56.600]   in both maintaining an active clinical life,
[02:59:56.600 --> 02:59:59.320]   seeing patients, men, women, people of different ages,
[02:59:59.320 --> 03:00:00.480]   different backgrounds, et cetera.
[03:00:00.480 --> 03:00:02.160]   I know you also do some work,
[03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:04.640]   I'll just mention this because it is important.
[03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:07.820]   You don't just work with people who can afford the work,
[03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:08.880]   you also do a lot of work
[03:00:08.880 --> 03:00:10.280]   with people in the military community
[03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:11.820]   who perhaps who cannot afford the work.
[03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:14.580]   So you make it a point to support communities
[03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:17.900]   that perhaps couldn't afford the kind of support
[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:19.580]   that they absolutely deserve.
[03:00:19.580 --> 03:00:21.220]   So thank you for that.
[03:00:21.220 --> 03:00:23.300]   Thank you also for being a public educator
[03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:26.100]   and such an avid one and really out there on Instagram,
[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:28.940]   on YouTube, with your own podcast, with your book.
[03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:30.380]   We'll provide links to all of those
[03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:32.420]   in the show note captions, of course.
[03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:35.060]   And I just love, love, love what you're doing.
[03:00:35.060 --> 03:00:38.140]   And I know as great as it's been,
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:39.420]   there's still much more to come.
[03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:41.580]   So thank you for taking the time to come here today,
[03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:43.900]   especially with the busy clinic, the businesses,
[03:00:43.900 --> 03:00:45.780]   and of course your family.
[03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:47.280]   People might not realize this,
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:48.860]   but Dr. Gabrielle Lyon does all this
[03:00:48.860 --> 03:00:52.740]   while maintaining a family with two children,
[03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:54.140]   a happy, healthy marriage.
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:55.460]   - And a husband in residency.
[03:00:55.460 --> 03:00:57.100]   - A husband in residency, and she's still pursuing.
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:00:57.940]   - Shout out to Baylor.
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:00.340]   - That's right, shout out to Baylor.
[03:01:00.340 --> 03:01:02.660]   And still pursuing advanced training
[03:01:02.660 --> 03:01:05.500]   in yet additional fields of medicine.
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:10.020]   So you are a phenom and I have both tremendous admiration
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:11.700]   and respect and gratitude for you.
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:13.060]   So thank you so much.
[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:14.660]   - Thank you so much.
[03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:16.520]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:18.140]   with Dr. Gabrielle Lyon.
[03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:19.580]   To learn more about her work
[03:01:19.580 --> 03:01:22.180]   and to find links to her book, "Forever Strong,"

[03:01:57.020 --> 03:01:58.740]   I do read all the comments.
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:01.020]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:03.940]   I am HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:07.060]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:08.820]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:10.340]   And on all those platforms,
[03:02:10.340 --> 03:02:12.460]   I discuss science and science-based tools,
[03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:13.900]   some of which overlap with the content
[03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:15.220]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:17.380]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:02:17.380 --> 03:02:18.600]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:22.100]   So again, it's HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:23.300]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:24.860]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:26.740]   our Neural Network newsletter
[03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:28.420]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:30.540]   that includes summaries of podcast episodes,
[03:02:30.540 --> 03:02:33.780]   as well as protocols as brief one to three page PDFs
[03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:36.500]   that include everything from deliberate cold exposure
[03:02:36.500 --> 03:02:39.420]   to exercise, to sleep, to optimizing dopamine.
[03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:40.580]   To sign up for the newsletter,
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:43.500]   simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu tab,

[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:48.100]   And I should mention that we do not share your email
[03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:49.260]   with anybody.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:52.540]   I also just want to mention once again that my new book,
[03:02:52.540 --> 03:02:54.780]   which I've been working on for more than five years
[03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:57.220]   and researching for more than three decades,
[03:02:57.220 --> 03:02:58.540]   which is entitled Protocols,
[03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:00.840]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:02.780]   is now available for presale
[03:03:02.780 --> 03:03:05.240]   by simply going to protocolsbook.com.
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:06.300]   And there you will find links
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:07.820]   to any number of different vendors
[03:03:07.820 --> 03:03:09.740]   and you can pick the one that you prefer.
[03:03:09.740 --> 03:03:12.060]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:13.620]   with Dr. Gabrielle Lyon.
[03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:15.940]   I hope you found the discussion to be as informative
[03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:18.140]   and actionable as I did.
[03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:21.220]   Indeed, it has motivated me to make several important changes
[03:03:21.220 --> 03:03:23.820]   in my nutritional and exercise program,
[03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:24.900]   which I've implemented
[03:03:24.900 --> 03:03:27.900]   and I'm already seeing spectacular results.
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:30.100]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:32.100]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:03:32.100 --> 03:03:34.680]   [upbeat music]
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:36.740]   you
