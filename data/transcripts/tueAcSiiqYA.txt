[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   The following is a conversation with Jordan Ellenberg,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.560]   a mathematician at University of Wisconsin,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.920]   and an author who masterfully reveals the beauty
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.200]   and power of mathematics in his 2014 book,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.000]   "How Not to Be Wrong," and his new book
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.560]   just released recently called "Shape,"
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.160]   the hidden geometry of information, biology, strategy,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.400]   democracy, and everything else.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.360]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.840]   Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.160]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.040]   As a side note, let me say that geometry
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.440]   is what made me fall in love with mathematics
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.560]   when I was young.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.080]   It first showed me that something definitive
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.960]   could be stated about this world
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440]   through intuitive visual proofs.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.840]   Somehow that convinced me that math
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.600]   is not just abstract numbers devoid of life,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.400]   but a part of life, part of this world,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.720]   part of our search for meaning.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.920]   and here is my conversation with Jordan Ellenberg.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   If the brain is a cake--
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.080]   - It is?
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   - Well, let's just go with me on this.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.200]   - Okay, we'll pause it.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.720]   - So for Noam Chomsky, language,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.040]   the universal grammar, the framework
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.000]   from which language springs is like most of the cake,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.920]   the delicious chocolate center,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.080]   and then the rest of cognition that we think of
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.760]   is built on top, extra layers,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.120]   maybe the icing on the cake,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.100]   maybe consciousness is just like a cherry on top.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.980]   Where do you put in this cake mathematical thinking?
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.100]   Is it as fundamental as language in the Chomsky view?
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.600]   Is it more fundamental than language?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.760]   Is it echoes of the same kind of abstract framework
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.480]   that he's thinking about in terms of language
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.000]   that they're all really tightly interconnected?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.880]   - That's a really interesting question.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.560]   You're getting me to reflect on this question
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.800]   of whether the feeling of producing mathematical output,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.400]   if you want, is like the process of uttering language
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   or producing linguistic output.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.000]   I think it feels something like that,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.640]   and it's certainly the case.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.480]   Let me put it this way.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   It's hard to imagine doing mathematics
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.400]   in a completely non-linguistic way.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.680]   It's hard to imagine doing mathematics
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.040]   without talking about mathematics
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.800]   and sort of thinking in propositions.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.760]   But maybe it's just because that's the way I do mathematics
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.560]   and maybe I can't imagine it any other way.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.720]   - Well, what about visualizing shapes,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.640]   visualizing concepts to which language
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.200]   is not obviously attachable?
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.080]   - Ah, that's a really interesting question.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.800]   And one thing it reminds me of
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.760]   is one thing I talk about in the book is dissection proofs,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.720]   these very beautiful proofs of geometric propositions.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   There's a very famous one by Bhaskara
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.260]   of the Pythagorean theorem.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.540]   Proofs which are purely visual,
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.220]   proofs where you show that two quantities are the same
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.340]   by taking the same pieces and putting them together one way
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.380]   and making one shape and putting them together another way
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.460]   and making a different shape.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.700]   And then observing that those two shapes
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.620]   must have the same area
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.100]   because they were built out of the same pieces.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.060]   There's a famous story,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.260]   and it's a little bit disputed about how accurate this is,
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.660]   but that in Bhaskara's manuscript,
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.620]   he sort of gives this proof, just gives the diagram,
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.180]   and then the entire verbal content of the proof
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.420]   is he just writes under it, "Behold!"
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.260]   Like that's it.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.340]   (laughing)
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.660]   There's some dispute about exactly how accurate that is.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.500]   But so then there's an interesting question.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.940]   If your proof is a diagram, if your proof is a picture,
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.260]   or even if your proof is like a movie of the same pieces
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.940]   like coming together in two different formations
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.780]   to make two different things, is that language?
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.620]   I'm not sure I have a good answer.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.700]   What do you think?
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.980]   - I think it is.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.980]   I think the process of manipulating the visual elements
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.100]   is the same as the process of manipulating
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.500]   the elements of language.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.980]   And I think probably the manipulating, the aggregation,
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.820]   the stitching stuff together is the important part.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.660]   It's not the actual specific elements.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.540]   It's more like to me, language is a process
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.780]   and math is a process.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.020]   It's not just specific symbols.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.140]   It's in action.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.700]   It's ultimately created through action, through change.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.180]   And so you're constantly evolving ideas.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.860]   Of course, we kind of attach,
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.740]   there's a certain destination you arrive to
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.080]   that you attach to and you call that a proof.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.580]   But that doesn't need to end there.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.980]   It's just at the end of the chapter
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.140]   and then it goes on and on and on in that kind of way.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.700]   But I gotta ask you about geometry
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.860]   and it's a prominent topic in your new book, "Shape."
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.020]   - So for me, geometry is the thing,
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.580]   just like as you're saying,
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.340]   made me fall in love with mathematics when I was young.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.740]   So being able to prove something visually
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.000]   just did something to my brain that it had this,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.580]   it planted this hopeful seed
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.320]   that you can understand the world like perfectly.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.580]   Maybe it's an OCD thing,
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.460]   but from a mathematics perspective,
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.700]   like humans are messy, the world is messy,
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.780]   biology is messy, your parents are yelling
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.580]   or making you do stuff, but you can cut through all that BS
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.980]   and truly understand the world through mathematics
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.300]   and nothing like geometry did that for me.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.620]   For you, you did not immediately
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.100]   fall in love with geometry.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.900]   So how do you think about geometry?
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.740]   Why is it a special field in mathematics?
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.920]   And how did you fall in love with it if you have?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.780]   - Wow, you've given me like a lot to say
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.340]   and certainly the experience that you describe
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.480]   is so typical, but there's two versions of it.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.260]   One thing I say in the book
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.740]   is that geometry is the cilantro of math.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.900]   People are not neutral about it.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.580]   There's people who like you are like,
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.900]   the rest of it I could take or leave,
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.240]   but then at this one moment, it made sense.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.420]   This class made sense, why wasn't it all like that?
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.900]   There's other people, I can tell you,
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.780]   'cause they come and talk to me all the time,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.780]   who are like, I understood all the stuff
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.180]   where you're trying to figure out what X was,
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.500]   there's some mystery, you're trying to solve it,
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.700]   X is a number, I figured it out.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.980]   But then there was this geometry, like what was that?
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.820]   What happened that year?
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.540]   Like I didn't get it, I was like lost the whole year
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.340]   and I didn't understand like why we even spent
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.300]   the time doing that.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.220]   But what everybody agrees on is that it's somehow different.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.260]   Right, there's something special about it.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.140]   We're gonna walk around in circles a little bit,
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.980]   but we'll get there.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.500]   You asked me how I fell in love with math.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.800]   I have a story about this.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.060]   When I was a small child, I don't know,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.060]   maybe like I was six or seven, I don't know.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.180]   I'm from the '70s, I think you're from a different decade
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.580]   than that, but in the '70s, you had a cool wooden box
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.180]   around your stereo, that was the look,
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.500]   everything was dark wood.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.580]   And the box had a bunch of holes in it
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.620]   to let the sound out.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.980]   And the holes were in this rectangular array,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.540]   a six by eight array of holes.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.880]   And I was just kind of zoning out in the living room
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.700]   as kids do, looking at this six by eight rectangular array
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.820]   of holes.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.740]   And if you like, just by kind of focusing in and out,
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.500]   just by kind of looking at this box,
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.100]   looking at this rectangle, I was like,
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.900]   well, there's six rows of eight holes each,
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.660]   but there's also eight columns of six holes each.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.500]   - Whoa.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.060]   - So eight sixes and six eights.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.100]   It's just like the dissection proofs
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.980]   we were just talking about.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.340]   But it's the same holes.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.380]   It's the same 48 holes, that's how many there are,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.820]   no matter whether you count them as rows
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.060]   or count them as columns.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.940]   And this was like unbelievable to me.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.020]   Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast?
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.220]   I don't know if that's, are we FCC regulated?
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.060]   Okay, it was fucking unbelievable.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.020]   Okay, that's the last time.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.860]   - Get it in there.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.680]   - This story merits it.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.460]   - So two different perspectives
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.220]   on the same physical reality.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.260]   - Exactly.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.820]   And it's just as you say,
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.460]   I knew the six times eight was the same as eight times six.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.620]   I knew my times tables.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.740]   I knew that that was a fact.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.620]   But did I really know it until that moment?
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.620]   That's the question.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.220]   Right, I knew that,
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.620]   I sort of knew that the times table was symmetric,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.940]   but I didn't know why that was the case until that moment.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.140]   And in that moment, I could see like,
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.660]   oh, I didn't have to have somebody tell me that.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.160]   That's information that you can just directly access.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.540]   That's a really amazing moment.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.460]   And as math teachers,
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.540]   that's something that we're really trying
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.540]   to bring to our students.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.500]   And I was one of those who did not love
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.300]   the kind of Euclidean geometry,
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.260]   ninth grade class of like,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.020]   prove that an isosceles triangle
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.700]   has equal angles at the base,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.540]   like this kind of thing.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.360]   It didn't vibe with me
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.020]   the way that algebra and numbers did.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.720]   But if you go back to that moment,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.860]   from my adult perspective,
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.620]   looking back at what happened with that rectangle,
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.460]   I think that is a very geometric moment.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.060]   In fact, that moment exactly encapsulates
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.060]   the intertwining of algebra and geometry.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.900]   This algebraic fact that,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.900]   well, in the instance,
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.880]   eight times six is equal to six times eight,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.180]   but in general, that whatever two numbers you have,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.300]   you multiply them one way,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.780]   and it's the same as if you multiply them
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.740]   in the other order.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.760]   It attaches it to this geometric fact
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.600]   about a rectangle,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.520]   which in some sense makes it true.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.360]   So, who knows, maybe I was always fated
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   to be an algebraic geometer,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.040]   which is what I am as a researcher.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.320]   - So, that's the kind of transformation,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.360]   and you talk about symmetry in your book.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.000]   What the heck is symmetry?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.600]   What the heck is these kinds of transformation
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.800]   on objects that once you transform them,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.440]   they seem to be similar?
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.460]   What do you make of it?
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.160]   What's its use in mathematics,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.300]   or maybe broadly in understanding our world?
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.340]   - Well, it's an absolutely fundamental concept,
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.720]   and it starts with the word symmetry
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.180]   in the way that we usually use it
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.600]   when we're just like talking English
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.760]   and not talking mathematics, right?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.680]   Sort of something is,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.920]   when we say something is symmetrical,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.640]   we usually means it has what's called
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.780]   an axis of symmetry.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.200]   Maybe like the left half of it
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.520]   looks the same as the right half.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.960]   That would be like a left-right axis of symmetry,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.020]   or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half,
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.860]   or both, right?
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.280]   Maybe there's sort of a fourfold symmetry
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.120]   where the top looks like the bottom
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.600]   and the left looks like the right, or more.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.340]   And that can take you in a lot of different directions.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.800]   The abstract study of what the possible
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.440]   combinations of symmetries there are,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.800]   a subject which is called group theory,
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.880]   was actually one of my first loves in mathematics,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.560]   what I thought about a lot when I was in college.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.280]   But the notion of symmetry is actually much more general
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.060]   than the things that we would call symmetry
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.440]   if we were looking at like a classical building
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.980]   or a painting or something like that.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.260]   You know, nowadays in math,
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.680]   we could use a symmetry to refer to
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.540]   any kind of transformation of an image
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.680]   or a space or an object.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.840]   You know, so what I talk about in the book
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.560]   is take a figure and stretch it vertically,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.920]   make it twice as big vertically,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.320]   and make it half as wide.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.060]   That I would call a symmetry.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.280]   It's not a symmetry in the classical sense,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.700]   but it's a well-defined transformation
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.600]   that has an input and an output.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.920]   I give you some shape, and it gets kind of,
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.160]   I call this in the book a scrunch.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.640]   I just had to make up some sort of funny sounding name for it
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.300]   'cause it doesn't really have a name.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.700]   And just as you can sort of study
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.760]   which kinds of objects are symmetrical
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.960]   under the operations of switching left and right
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.520]   or switching top and bottom
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.860]   or rotating 40 degrees or what have you,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.880]   you could study what kinds of things are preserved
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.320]   by this kind of scrunch symmetry.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.480]   And this kind of more general idea
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.880]   of what a symmetry can be,
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.680]   let me put it this way.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.240]   A fundamental mathematical idea,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.980]   in some sense, I might even say the idea
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.320]   that dominates contemporary mathematics.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   Or by contemporary, by the way,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.220]   I mean like the last 150 years.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.180]   We're on a very long timescale in math.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.020]   I don't mean like yesterday.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.920]   I mean like a century or so up till now.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.560]   Is this idea that it's a fundamental question
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.100]   of when do we consider two things to be the same.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.700]   That might seem like a complete triviality.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's not.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.180]   For instance, if I have a triangle,
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.920]   and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions,
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.300]   but it's over here, are those the same or different?
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.940]   Well, you might say, well, look, there's two different things.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.380]   This one's over here, this one's over there.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.740]   On the other hand, if you prove a theorem about this one,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.660]   it's probably still true about this one
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.800]   if it has like all the same side lanes and angles
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.420]   and like looks exactly the same.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.620]   The term of art, if you want it,
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.700]   you would say they're congruent.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.780]   But one way of saying it is there's a symmetry
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.580]   called translation, which just means
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.740]   move everything three inches to the left.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.060]   And we want all of our theories
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.420]   to be translation invariant.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.900]   What that means is that if you prove a theorem
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.840]   about a thing that's over here,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.600]   and then you move it three inches to the left,
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.420]   it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.780]   like didn't still work.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.580]   So this question of like, what are the symmetries
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.900]   and which things that you want to study
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.420]   are invariant under those symmetries
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.340]   is absolutely fundamental.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.980]   Boy, this is getting a little abstract, right?
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.120]   - It's not at all abstract.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.340]   I think this is completely central
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.740]   to everything I think about
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.340]   in terms of artificial intelligence.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.500]   I don't know if you know about the MNIST dataset,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.980]   what's handwritten digits.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.240]   - Yeah.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.240]   - And, you know, I don't smoke much weed or any really,
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.220]   but it certainly feels like it when I look at MNIST
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.380]   and think about this stuff, which is like,
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.620]   what's the difference between one and two?
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.180]   And why are all the twos similar to each other?
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.180]   What kind of transformations are within the category
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.260]   of what makes a thing the same?
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.720]   And what kind of transformations
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.540]   are those that make it different?
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.020]   And symmetry is core to that.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.740]   In fact, whatever the hell our brain is doing,
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.420]   it's really good at constructing these arbitrary
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.120]   and sometimes novel, which is really important
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.420]   when you look at like the IQ test,
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.420]   or they feel novel ideas of symmetry of like,
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.860]   what like playing with objects,
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.980]   we're able to see things that are the same and not,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.660]   and construct almost like little geometric theories
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.380]   of what makes things the same and not,
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.340]   and how to make programs do that in AI
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.060]   is a total open question.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.820]   And so I kind of stared and wonder
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.940]   how, what kind of symmetries are enough
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.840]   to solve the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.260]   and write that down?
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.820]   - Exactly, and what's so fascinating
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.420]   about the work in that direction,
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.260]   from the point of view of a mathematician like me
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.500]   and a geometer, is that the kind of groups of symmetries,
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.540]   the types of symmetries that we know of
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.900]   are not sufficient, right?
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.380]   So in other words, like,
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.240]   we're just gonna keep on going into the weeds on this.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.260]   - Let's go.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.460]   The deeper, the better.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.420]   - You know, a kind of symmetry
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.700]   that we understand very well is rotation, right?
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.900]   So here's what would be easy.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.940]   If humans, if we recognized a digit as a one,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.620]   if it was like literally a rotation
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.020]   by some number of degrees,
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.100]   with some fixed one in some typeface,
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.420]   like Palatino or something,
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.060]   that would be very easy to understand, right?
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.900]   It would be very easy to like write a program
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.340]   that could detect whether something was a rotation
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.660]   of a fixed digit one.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.620]   Whatever we're doing when you recognize the digit one
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.900]   and distinguish it from the digit two, it's not that.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.660]   It's not just incorporating
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.100]   one of the types of symmetries that we understand.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.620]   Now, I would say that I would be shocked
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.620]   if there was some kind of classical symmetry type formulation
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.320]   that captured what we're doing
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.580]   when we tell the difference between a two and a three,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.420]   to be honest.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.940]   I think what we're doing is actually more complicated
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.260]   than that, I feel like it must be.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.660]   - They're so simple, these numbers.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.820]   I mean, they're really geometric objects.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.580]   Like we can draw a one, two, three.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.140]   It does seem like it should be formalizable.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.180]   That's why it's so strange.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.180]   - Do you think it's formalizable
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.820]   when something stops being a two and starts being a three,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.980]   where you can imagine something continuously deforming
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.100]   from being a two to a three?
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.420]   - Yeah, but that's, there is a moment.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.700]   I have myself written programs that literally morph
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.740]   twos and threes and so on.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.920]   And you watch, and there is moments that you notice,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.880]   depending on the trajectory of that transformation,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.880]   that morphing, that it is a three and a two.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.580]   There's a hard line.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.340]   - Wait, so if you ask people, if you show them this morph,
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.340]   if you ask a bunch of people,
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.340]   do they all agree about where the transition happened?
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.180]   - That's an interesting question.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.000]   - 'Cause I would be surprised.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.840]   - I think so.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.900]   - Oh my God, okay, we have an empirical dispute.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.620]   - But here's the problem.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.260]   Here's the problem, that if I just showed that moment
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.940]   that I agreed on.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.780]   - That's not fair.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.500]   - No, but say I said, so I wanna move away
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.460]   from the agreement 'cause that's a fascinating,
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.460]   actually, question that I wanna backtrack from
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.140]   because I just dogmatically said,
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.860]   'cause I could be very, very wrong.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.860]   But the morphing really helps, that the change,
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.340]   'cause I mean, partially it's because
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.340]   our perception systems, see,
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.060]   it's all probably tied in there.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.020]   Somehow the change from one to the other,
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.980]   like seeing the video of it, allows you to pinpoint
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.660]   the place where a two becomes a three much better.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.980]   If I just showed you one picture,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.980]   I think you might really, really struggle.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.220]   You might call it a seven.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.060]   (laughs)
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.380]   I think there's something also
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.940]   that we don't often think about,
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.580]   which is it's not just about the static image,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.980]   it's the transformation of the image,
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.540]   or it's not a static shape,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.580]   it's the transformation of the shape.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.540]   There's something in the movement that seems to be
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.300]   not just about our perception system,
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.060]   but fundamental to our cognition,
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.700]   like how we think about stuff.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.340]   - Yeah, and that's part of geometry too.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.220]   And in fact, again, another insight of modern geometry
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.060]   is this idea that maybe we would naively think
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.020]   we're gonna study, I don't know, like Poincaré,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.420]   we're gonna study the three-body problem.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.460]   We're gonna study three objects in space
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.260]   moving around subject only to the force
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.620]   of each other's gravity, which sounds very simple, right?
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.740]   And if you don't know about this problem,
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.580]   you're probably like, okay,
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.260]   so you just put it in your computer and see what they do.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.100]   Well, guess what?
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.260]   That's a problem that Poincaré won a huge prize for,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.420]   making the first real progress on in the 1880s,
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.420]   and we still don't know that much about it 150 years later.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.860]   It's a humongous mystery.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.060]   - You just open the door, and we're gonna walk right in
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.460]   before we return to symmetry.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.900]   Who's Poincaré, and what's this conjecture
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.940]   that he came up with?
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.620]   Why is it such a hard problem?
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.180]   - Okay, so Poincaré, he ends up being a major figure
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.220]   in the book, and I didn't even really intend for him
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:59.220]   to be such a big figure, but he's first and foremost
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.140]   a geometer, right?
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.620]   So he's a mathematician who kind of comes up
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.140]   in late 19th century France at a time
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.380]   when French math is really starting to flower.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.220]   Actually, I learned a lot.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.660]   I mean, in math, we're not really trained
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.700]   on our own history.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.300]   We get a PhD in math, learn about math.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.220]   So I learned a lot.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.620]   There's this whole kind of moment where France
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.080]   has just been beaten in the Franco-Prussian War,
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.860]   and they're like, oh my God, what did we do wrong?
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.460]   And they were like, we gotta get strong in math
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.280]   like the Germans.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.460]   We have to be more like the Germans,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.880]   so this never happens to us again.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.780]   So it's very much, it's like the Sputnik moment,
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.620]   you know, like what happens in America in the '50s and '60s
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.460]   with the Soviet Union.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.740]   This is happening to France,
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.580]   and they're trying to kind of like
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.380]   instantly like modernize.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.100]   - That's fascinating that the humans and mathematics
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.780]   are intricately connected to the history of humans.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.940]   The Cold War is, I think, fundamental
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.180]   to the way people saw science and math in the Soviet Union.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.740]   I don't know if that was true in the United States,
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.540]   but certainly it was in the Soviet Union.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.980]   - It definitely was, and I would love to hear more
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.580]   about how it was in the Soviet Union.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.940]   - I mean, there was, and we'll talk about the Olympiad.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.700]   I just remember that there was this feeling
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:14.300]   like the world hung in a balance
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   and you could save the world with the tools of science,
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:25.060]   and mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:30.220]   And so like people were seen as, you know,
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.900]   people in America often idolize athletes,
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.700]   but ultimately the best athletes in the world,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.020]   they just throw a ball into a basket.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.260]   So like there's not, what people really enjoy about sports,
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.660]   I love sports, is like excellence at the highest level.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.300]   But when you take that with mathematics and science,
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.860]   in the Soviet Union, but there's an extra sense
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.300]   that that excellence will lead to a better world.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.380]   So that created all the usual things you think about
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.260]   with the Olympics,
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.180]   which is like extreme competitiveness, right?
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.140]   But it also created this sense that in the modern era
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   in America, somebody like Elon Musk,
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.460]   whatever you think of him, like Jeff Bezos, those folks,
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.500]   they inspire the possibility that one person
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.040]   or a group of smart people can change the world.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.060]   Like not just be good at what they do,
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.660]   but actually change the world.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.500]   Mathematics was at the core of that.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.040]   I don't know, there's a romanticism around it too.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.480]   Like when you read books about in America,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.700]   people romanticize certain things like baseball,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.680]   for example, there's like these beautiful poetic writing
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.420]   about the game of baseball.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.620]   The same was the feeling with mathematics and science
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.180]   in the Soviet Union, and it was in the air.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.260]   Everybody was forced to take high level mathematics courses.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.480]   Like you took a lot of math, you took a lot of science
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.260]   and a lot of like really rigorous literature.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.580]   Like the level of education in Russia,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.180]   this could be true in China, I'm not sure,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.100]   in a lot of countries is in whatever that's called,
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.760]   it's K to 12 in America, but like young people education,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.340]   the level they were challenged to learn at is incredible.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.980]   It's like America falls far behind, I would say.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.900]   America then quickly catches up
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.660]   and then exceeds everybody else at the like the,
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.360]   as you start approaching the end of high school to college,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.040]   like the university system in the United States
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.280]   arguably is the best in the world.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.180]   But like what we challenge everybody,
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.560]   it's not just like the A students,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.200]   but everybody to learn in the Soviet Union was fascinating.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.060]   - I think I'm gonna pick up on something you said.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.800]   I think you would love a book called
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.360]   "Duel at Dawn" by Amir Alexander,
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.720]   which I think some of the things you're responding to
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.020]   what I wrote, I think I first got turned on to
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.880]   by Amir's work, he's a historian of math.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.040]   And he writes about the story of Everest Galois,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.280]   which is a story that's well known to all mathematicians,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.880]   this kind of like very, very romantic figure
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.360]   who he really sort of like begins the development
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.980]   of this, well, this theory of groups
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.100]   that I mentioned earlier,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.360]   this general theory of symmetries
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.520]   and then dies in a duel in his early 20s,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.400]   like all this stuff, mostly unpublished.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.100]   It's a very, very romantic story that we all learn.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:36.880]   And much of it is true, but Alexander really lays out
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.480]   just how much the way people thought about math
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.400]   in those times in the early 19th century
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.480]   was wound up with, as you say, romanticism.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.160]   I mean, that's when the romantic movement takes place.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.200]   And he really outlines how people were predisposed
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.800]   to think about mathematics in that way,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.240]   because they thought about poetry that way.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.720]   And they thought about music that way.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.280]   It was the mood of the era to think about,
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.960]   we're reaching for the transcendent,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.040]   we're sort of reaching for sort of direct contact
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.880]   with the divine.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.120]   And so part of the reason that we think of Galois that way
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.760]   was because Galois himself was a creature of that era
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.660]   and he romanticized himself.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.720]   I mean, now we know he like wrote lots of letters
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.960]   and like he was kind of like, I mean, in modern terms,
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.600]   we would say he was extremely emo.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.840]   Like that's, like just, we wrote all these letters
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.560]   about his like florid feelings and like the fire within him
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.400]   about the mathematics.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.320]   You know, so he, so it's just as you say
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.660]   that the math history touches human history.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.760]   They're never separate because math is made of people.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.600]   - Yeah.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.580]   - I mean, that's what it's, it's people who do it
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.860]   and we're human beings doing it.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.160]   And we do it within whatever community we're in
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.680]   and we do it affected by the mores
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.120]   of the society around us.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.400]   - So the French, the Germans and Poincaré.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.920]   - Yes, okay, so back to Poincaré.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.560]   So he's, you know, it's funny.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.760]   This book is filled with kind of, you know,
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.920]   mathematical characters who often are kind of peevish
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.040]   or get into feuds or sort of have like weird enthusiasms
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.160]   'cause those people are fun to write about
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.480]   and they sort of like say very salty things.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.560]   Poincaré is actually none of this.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.480]   As far as I can tell, he was an extremely normal dude.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.240]   He didn't get into fights with people
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.320]   and everybody liked him
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.080]   and he was like pretty personally modest
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.960]   and he had very regular habits, you know what I mean?
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.760]   He did math for like four hours in the morning
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.680]   and four hours in the evening and that was it.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.240]   Like he had his schedule.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.680]   I actually, it was like, I still am feeling like
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.400]   somebody's gonna tell me now that the book is out,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.760]   like, oh, didn't you know about this?
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.040]   Like incredibly sordid episode of this.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.960]   As far as I could tell, a completely normal guy.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   But he just kind of in many ways creates
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.800]   the geometric world in which we live
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   and his first really big success is this prize paper
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.120]   he writes for this prize offered by the King of Sweden
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.560]   for the study of the three-body problem.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.280]   The study of what we can say about, yeah,
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.320]   three astronomical objects moving
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.120]   in what you might think would be this very simple way.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.520]   Nothing's going on except gravity.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.680]   - So what's the three-body problem?
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.040]   Why is that a problem?
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.840]   - So the problem is to understand
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.040]   when this motion is stable and when it's not.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.880]   So stable meaning they would sort of like end up
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.680]   in some kind of periodic orbit.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.440]   Or I guess it would mean, sorry,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.960]   stable would mean they never sort of fly off
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.080]   far apart from each other.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.160]   And unstable would mean like eventually they fly apart.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.880]   - So understanding two bodies is much easier.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.720]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.560]   - When you have the third wheel is always a problem.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.400]   - This is what Newton knew.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.760]   Two bodies, they sort of orbit each other
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.320]   in some kind of, either in an ellipse,
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.240]   which is the stable case.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.200]   That's what the planets do that we know.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.360]   Or one travels on a hyperbola around the other.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.320]   That's the unstable case.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.920]   It sort of like zooms in from far away,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.280]   sort of like whips around the heavier thing
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.720]   and like zooms out.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.120]   Those are basically the two options.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.840]   So it's a very simple and easy to classify story.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   With three bodies, just a small switch from two to three,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.200]   it's a complete zoo.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.000]   It's the first, what we would say now
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.920]   is it's the first example of what's called chaotic dynamics
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.040]   where the stable solutions and the unstable solutions,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.520]   they're kind of like wound in among each other.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.720]   And a very, very, very tiny change
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.400]   in the initial conditions can make the long-term behavior
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.240]   of the system completely different.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.000]   So Poincaré was the first to recognize
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.040]   that that phenomenon even existed.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.180]   - What about the conjecture that carries his name?
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:36.180]   - Right, so he also was one of the pioneers
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.440]   of taking geometry, which until that point
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.120]   had been largely the study of two
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.240]   and three-dimensional objects
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.480]   'cause that's like what we see, right?
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.280]   That's the objects we interact with.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.600]   He developed a subject we now called topology.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.360]   He called it Analysis Citus.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.880]   He was a very well-spoken guy with a lot of slogans,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.320]   but that name did not, you can see why that name
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.160]   did not catch on.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.360]   So now it's called topology now.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.320]   - Sorry, what was it called before?
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.400]   - Analysis Citus, which I guess sort of roughly means
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.000]   like the analysis of location or something like that.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.200]   It's a Latin phrase.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:20.080]   Partly because he understood that even to understand stuff
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.440]   that's going on in our physical world,
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.360]   you have to study higher-dimensional spaces.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.480]   How does this work?
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.440]   And this is kind of like where my brain went to it
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.840]   because you were talking about not just where things are,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.720]   but what their path is, how they're moving
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.800]   when we were talking about the path from two to three.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.600]   He understood that if you want to study three bodies
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   moving in space, well, each body, it has a location
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.920]   where it is, so it has an X coordinate, a Y coordinate,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.760]   a Z coordinate, right?
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.400]   I can specify a point in space by giving you three numbers,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.080]   but it also, at each moment, has a velocity.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.480]   So it turns out that really to understand what's going on,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.880]   you can't think of it as a point, or you could,
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.000]   but it's better not to think of it as a point
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.240]   in three-dimensional space that's moving.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.400]   It's better to think of it as a point
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.520]   in six-dimensional space where the coordinates are
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.320]   where is it and what's its velocity right now.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.760]   That's a higher-dimensional space called phase space.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.180]   And if you haven't thought about this before,
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.920]   I admit that it's a little bit mind-bending,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.720]   but what he needed then was a geometry
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.600]   that was flexible enough, not just to talk about
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.560]   two-dimensional spaces or three-dimensional spaces,
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.480]   but any dimensional space.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.320]   So the sort of famous first line of this paper
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.800]   where he introduces analysis situs
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.280]   is no one doubts nowadays that the geometry
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.760]   of n-dimensional space is an actually existing thing.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.640]   I think maybe that had been controversial.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.320]   He's saying, "Look, let's face it.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.940]   "Just because it's not physical
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.980]   "doesn't mean it's not there.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.080]   "It doesn't mean we shouldn't study it."
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.920]   - Interesting.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.600]   He wasn't jumping to the physical interpretation.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.640]   It can be real even if it's not perceivable
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.760]   to the human cognition.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.880]   - I think that's right.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.400]   I think, don't get me wrong,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.300]   Poincaré never strays far from physics.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.120]   He's always motivated by physics,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.720]   but the physics drove him to need to think about
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.240]   spaces of higher dimension,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.420]   and so he needed a formalism that was rich enough
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.480]   to enable him to do that.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.120]   And once you do that, that formalism
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.600]   is also gonna include things that are not physical.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.560]   And then you have two choices.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.720]   You can be like, "Oh, well, that stuff's trash,"
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.280]   or, and this is more the mathematician's frame of mind,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.640]   if you have a formalistic framework
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.880]   that seems really good and sort of seems to be
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.160]   very elegant and work well,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.020]   and it includes all the physical stuff,
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.520]   maybe we should think about all of it.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.360]   Like, maybe we should think about it,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.600]   thinking, "Oh, maybe there's some gold to be mined there."
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.800]   And indeed, guess what?
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.080]   Before long, there's relativity and there's space-time,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.520]   and all of a sudden, it's like, "Oh, yeah,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.480]   "maybe it's a good idea.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.820]   "We already have this geometric apparatus set up
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.280]   "for how to think about four-dimensional spaces.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.240]   "Turns out they're real after all."
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.280]   This is a story much told in mathematics,
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.680]   not just in this context, but in many.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.640]   - I'd love to dig in a little deeper on that, actually,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   'cause I have some intuitions to work out.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.660]   - Okay. - In my brain, but--
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.580]   - Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.580]   so we can work it out together.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.020]   - Good, we'll together walk along the path of curiosity.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.340]   But Poincaré conjecture, what is it?
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.660]   - The Poincaré conjecture is about
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.900]   curved three-dimensional spaces.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.060]   So I was on my way there, I promise.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.680]   The idea is that we perceive ourselves as living in,
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.120]   we don't say a three-dimensional space,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.520]   we just say three-dimensional space.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.240]   You can go up and down, you can go left and right,
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.200]   you can go forward and back.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.480]   There's three dimensions in which we can move.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.800]   In Poincaré's theory, there are many possible
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.680]   three-dimensional spaces.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.320]   In the same way that going down one dimension
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.420]   to sort of capture our intuition a little bit more,
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.680]   we know there are lots of different
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.080]   two-dimensional surfaces, right?
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   There's a balloon, and that looks one way,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.520]   and a donut looks another way,
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.640]   and a Mobius strip looks a third way.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.120]   Those are all two-dimensional surfaces
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.360]   that we can kind of really get a global view of,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.880]   because we live in three-dimensional space,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.480]   so we can see a two-dimensional surface
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.160]   sort of sitting in our three-dimensional space.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.220]   Well, to see a three-dimensional space whole,
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.180]   we'd have to kind of have four-dimensional eyes, right?
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.960]   Which we don't, so we have to use our mathematical eyes,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.960]   we have to envision.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:22.060]   The Poincaré conjecture says that there's a very simple way
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.440]   to determine whether a three-dimensional space
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.600]   is the standard one, the one that we're used to.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.840]   And essentially, it's that it's what's called
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.600]   fundamental group has nothing interesting in it.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.580]   And that I can actually say,
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.920]   without saying what the fundamental group is,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.960]   I can tell you what the criterion is.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.840]   This would be good, oh look, I can even use a visual aid.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.320]   So for the people watching this on YouTube,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.160]   you'll just see this.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.120]   For the people on the podcast, you'll have to visualize it.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.080]   So Lex has been nice enough to give me a surface
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.400]   with some interesting topology.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.240]   - It's a mug.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.280]   - Right here in front of me.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.120]   A mug, yes, I might say it's a genus one surface,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.280]   but we could also say it's a mug, same thing.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.960]   So if I were to draw a little circle on this mug,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.320]   oh, which way should I draw it so it's visible?
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.240]   Like here, okay.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.480]   If I draw a little circle on this mug,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.360]   imagine this to be a loop of string.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.040]   I could pull that loop of string closed
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.600]   on the surface of the mug, right?
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.840]   That's definitely something I could do.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.320]   I could shrink it, shrink it, shrink it until it's a point.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.040]   On the other hand, if I draw a loop
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   that goes around the handle, I can kind of zhuzh it up here
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.840]   and I can zhuzh it down there and I can sort of slide it up
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.240]   and down the handle, but I can't pull it closed, can I?
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.800]   It's trapped.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.640]   Not without breaking the surface of the mug, right?
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.320]   Not without like going inside.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.080]   So the condition of being what's called simply connected,
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.760]   this is one of Poincare's inventions,
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.600]   says that any loop of string can be pulled shut.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.040]   So it's a feature that the mug simply does not have.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.480]   This is a non-simply connected mug
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.040]   and a simply connected mug would be a cup, right?
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.520]   You would burn your hand when you drank coffee out of it.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.480]   - So you're saying the universe is not a mug?
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.280]   - Well, I can't speak to the universe,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   but what I can say is that regular old space is not a mug.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.000]   Regular old space, if you like sort of actually
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.520]   physically have like a loop of string,
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.920]   you can pull it shut. - You can always close it.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.600]   You can always pull it shut.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.000]   - But you know, what if your piece of string
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.920]   was the size of the universe?
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.320]   Like what if your piece of string
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.080]   was like billions of light years long?
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.160]   Like how do you actually know?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.440]   - I mean, that's still an open question
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.560]   of the shape of the universe.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.800]   - Exactly.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.440]   - Whether it's, I think there's a lot,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.600]   there is ideas of it being a torus.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.400]   I mean, there's some trippy ideas
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.440]   and they're not like weird out there, controversial.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.160]   There's legitimate at the center of cosmology debate.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.000]   I mean, I think most people think it's flat.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.840]   - I think there's somebody who thinks
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.160]   that there's like some kind of dodecahedral symmetry
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.600]   or I mean, I remember reading something crazy
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.920]   about somebody saying that they saw the signature of that
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.520]   in the cosmic noise or what have you.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.800]   I mean.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.380]   - To make the flat earthers happy,
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.380]   I do believe that the current main belief is it's flat.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.800]   It's flat-ish or something like that.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.960]   The shape of the universe is flat-ish.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.120]   I don't know what the heck that means.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.600]   I think that has like a very,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.680]   I mean, how are you even supposed to think about
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.160]   the shape of a thing
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.120]   that doesn't have anything outside of it?
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.960]   I mean.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.720]   - Ah, but that's exactly what topology does.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.400]   Topology is what's called an intrinsic theory.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.320]   That's what's so great about it.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.560]   This question about the mug,
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.960]   you could answer it without ever leaving the mug, right?
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.920]   Because it's a question about a loop drawn
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.560]   on the surface of the mug and what happens
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.760]   if it never leaves that surface.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.480]   So it's like always there.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.800]   - See, but that's the difference between the topology
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.480]   and say if you're like trying to visualize a mug,
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.560]   that you can't visualize a mug while living inside the mug.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.520]   - Well, that's true.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.160]   The visualization is harder, but in some sense,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.960]   no, you're right, but if the tools of mathematics are there,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.680]   I, sorry, I don't wanna fight,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.560]   but I was like the tools of mathematics are exactly there
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.000]   to enable you to think about
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.720]   what you cannot visualize in this way.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.640]   Let me give, let's go,
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.120]   always to make things easier, go down a dimension.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.800]   Let's think about we live on a circle, okay?
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   You can tell whether you live on a circle or a line segment
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.360]   because if you live on a circle,
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.800]   if you walk a long way in one direction,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.200]   you find yourself back where you started.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.280]   And if you live in a line segment,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.720]   you walk for a long enough one direction,
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.200]   you come to the end of the world.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.880]   Or if you live on a line, like a whole line,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   an infinite line, then you walk in one direction
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.120]   for a long time and like,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.760]   well, then there's not a sort of terminating algorithm
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.520]   to figure out whether you live on a line or a circle,
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.720]   but at least you sort of,
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   at least you don't discover that you live on a circle.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.400]   So all of those are intrinsic things, right?
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.720]   All of those are things that you can figure out
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.120]   about your world without leaving your world.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.360]   On the other hand, ready?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.240]   Now we're gonna go from intrinsic to extrinsic.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.960]   Why did I not know we were gonna talk about this,
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.040]   but why not?
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.880]   - Why not?
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.400]   - If you can't tell whether you live in a circle or a knot,
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.960]   like imagine like a knot floating in three-dimensional space.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.720]   The person who lives on that knot, to them it's a circle.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.760]   They walk a long way, they come back to where they started.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.320]   Now we with our three-dimensional eyes can be like,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.640]   oh, this one's just a plain circle
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.720]   and this one's knotted up.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.760]   But that has to do with how they sit
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.640]   in three-dimensional space.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.160]   It doesn't have to do with intrinsic features
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   of those people's world.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.920]   - We can ask you one ape to another.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.160]   Does it make you, how does it make you feel
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.880]   that you don't know if you live in a circle
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.800]   or on a knot, in a knot,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   inside the string that forms the knot?
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.560]   - I'm gonna be honest-- - I don't even know
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.400]   how to say that.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.220]   - I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.600]   I don't know if like, I fear you won't like this answer,
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.160]   but it does not bother me at all.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.400]   I don't lose one minute of sleep over it.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.720]   - So like, does it bother you that if we look
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.160]   at like a Mobius strip, that you don't have
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.080]   an obvious way of knowing whether you are inside
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.720]   of a cylinder, if you live on a surface of a cylinder
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.000]   or you live on the surface of a Mobius strip?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.400]   - No, I think you can tell.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.080]   - If you live-- - Which one?
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.440]   Because what you do is you like, tell your friend,
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.120]   hey, stay right here, I'm just gonna go for a walk,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.680]   and then you like, walk for a long time in one direction
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.240]   and then you come back and you see your friend again,
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.360]   and if your friend is reversed,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.720]   then you know you live on a Mobius strip.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.800]   - Well, no, because you won't see your friend, right?
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.000]   - Okay, fair point, fair point on that.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   - But you have to believe the stories about,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.320]   no, I don't even know.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.160]   Would you even know?
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.800]   Would you really-- - Oh, no, your point is right.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.120]   Let me try to think of a better,
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.960]   let's see if I can do this on the vlog.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.560]   - It may not be correct to talk about
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.280]   cognitive beings living on a Mobius strip
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.880]   because there's a lot of things taken for granted there,
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.800]   and we're constantly imagining actual
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.240]   three-dimensional creatures,
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.120]   like how it actually feels like
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   to live on a Mobius strip is tricky to internalize.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.800]   - I think that on what's called the real projective plane,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.840]   which is kind of even more sort of messed up version
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.480]   of the Mobius strip, but with very similar features,
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.280]   this feature of kind of only having one side,
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.440]   that has the feature that there's a loop of string,
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.720]   which can't be pulled closed,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.640]   but if you loop it around twice along the same path,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.280]   that you can pull closed.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.920]   That's extremely weird.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.760]   - Yeah.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.200]   - But that would be a way you could know
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.720]   without leaving your world that
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.320]   something very funny is going on.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.920]   - You know what's extremely weird?
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.200]   Maybe we can comment on,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.840]   hopefully it's not too much of a tangent,
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.000]   is I remember thinking about this.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.320]   This might be right.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.760]   This might be wrong.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.400]   But if we now talk about a sphere,
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.560]   and you're living inside a sphere,
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.160]   that you're going to see everywhere around you
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.600]   the back of your own head.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:51.680]   This is very counterintuitive to me to think about,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.520]   maybe it's wrong.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.280]   But 'cause I was thinking of like Earth,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.120]   your 3D thing sitting on a sphere.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.120]   But if you're living inside the sphere,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   you're going to see, if you look straight,
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.480]   you're always going to see yourself all the way around.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.800]   So everywhere you look,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.120]   there's gonna be the back of your own head.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.840]   - I think somehow this depends on something
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.000]   of how the physics of light works in this scenario,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.760]   which I'm finding it hard to bend my--
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.600]   - That's true.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.680]   The sea is doing a lot of work.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.400]   Saying you see something is doing a lot of work.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.520]   - People have thought about this,
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.600]   I mean this metaphor of what if we're little creatures
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.040]   in some sort of smaller world?
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.520]   How could we apprehend what's outside?
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.400]   That metaphor just comes back and back.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.960]   And actually I didn't even realize how frequent it is.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.400]   It comes up in the book a lot.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.320]   I know it from a book called Flatland.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.480]   I don't know if you ever read this when you were a kid.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.320]   - A while ago, yeah.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.480]   - An adult.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.600]   This sort of comic novel from the 19th century
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.720]   about an entire two-dimensional world.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.560]   It's narrated by a square, that's the main character.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.240]   And the kind of strangeness that befalls him
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.920]   when one day he's in his house
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.520]   and suddenly there's a little circle there
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.440]   and they're with him.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.120]   But then the circle starts getting bigger
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.360]   and bigger and bigger.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.080]   And he's like, what the hell is going on?
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.520]   It's like a horror movie for two-dimensional people.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.840]   And of course what's happening
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.200]   is that a sphere is entering his world.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.800]   And as the sphere moves farther and farther into the plane,
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.480]   it's cross-sectioned, the part of it that he can see.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.240]   To him it looks like there's this kind of bizarre being
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.600]   that's getting larger and larger and larger.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.320]   Until it's exactly sort of halfway through.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.160]   And then they have this kind of philosophical argument
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   where the sphere's like, I'm a sphere,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.040]   I'm from the third dimension.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.200]   The square's like, what are you talking about?
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.360]   There's no such thing.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.200]   And they have this kind of sterile argument
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.640]   where the square is not able to follow
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.960]   the mathematical reasoning of the sphere
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.360]   until the sphere just kind of grabs him
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.760]   and jerks him out of the plane and pulls him up.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.560]   And it's like, now, now do you see?
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.240]   Now do you see your whole world
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.080]   that you didn't understand before?
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.800]   - So do you think that kind of process
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.560]   is possible for us humans?
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.360]   So we live in a three-dimensional world,
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.520]   maybe with a time component four-dimensional.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.520]   And then math allows us to go into high dimensions
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.500]   comfortably and explore the world from those perspectives.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:20.360]   Is it possible that the universe is many more dimensions
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.160]   than the ones we experience as human beings?
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.800]   So if you look at the,
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.960]   especially in physics theories of everything,
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.440]   physics theories that try to unify general relativity
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.360]   and quantum field theory,
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   they seem to go to high dimensions to work stuff out
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.600]   through the tools of mathematics.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.680]   Is it possible, so like the two options are,
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.200]   one is just a nice way to analyze,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.680]   a universe, but the reality is as exactly we perceive it,
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.200]   it is three-dimensional.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.720]   Or are we just seeing, are we those flatland creatures
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   that are just seeing a tiny slice of reality
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   and the actual reality is many, many, many more dimensions
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.920]   than the three dimensions we perceive?
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.920]   - Oh, I certainly think that's possible.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.840]   Now, how would you figure out whether it was true or not
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.920]   is another question.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.160]   And I suppose what you would do,
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.040]   as with anything else that you can't directly perceive,
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   is you would try to understand what effect
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.800]   the presence of those extra dimensions out there
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.920]   would have on the things we can perceive.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.320]   Like what else can you do, right?
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.260]   And in some sense, if the answer is
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.720]   they would have no effect,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.000]   then maybe it becomes like a little bit of a sterile question
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.320]   'cause what question are you even asking, right?
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.680]   You can kind of posit however many entities that you want.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.840]   - Is it possible to intuit how to mess
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.800]   with the other dimensions while living
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.280]   in a three-dimensional world?
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.000]   I mean, that seems like a very challenging thing to do.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   The reason flatland could be written
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.400]   is because it's coming from a three-dimensional writer.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.840]   - Yes, but what happens in the book,
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.200]   I didn't even tell you the whole plot,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.160]   what happens is the square is so excited
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.920]   and so filled with intellectual joy.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.160]   By the way, maybe to give the story some context,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.120]   you ask is it possible for us humans
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.440]   to have this experience of being transcendentally jerked
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.960]   out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from above?
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.720]   Well, Edwin Abbott, who wrote the book,
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.900]   certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was a minister.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.840]   So the whole Christian subtext of this book,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.800]   I had completely not grasped reading this as a kid,
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.400]   that it means a very different thing, right?
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.680]   If sort of a theologian is saying like,
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.240]   oh, what if a higher being could pull you out
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.000]   of this earthly world you live in
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.360]   so that you can sort of see the truth
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.480]   and really see it from above, as it were.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.560]   So that's one of the things that's going on for him.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.440]   And it's a testament to his skill as a writer
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.000]   that his story just works,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   whether that's the framework you're coming to it from or not.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.800]   But what happens in this book,
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.960]   and this part now, looking at it through a Christian lens,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.160]   it becomes a bit subversive,
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.200]   is the square is so excited
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.760]   about what he's learned from the sphere,
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.720]   and the sphere explains to him what a cube would be.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.000]   Oh, it's like you, but three-dimensional,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   and the square is very excited.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.160]   And the square is like, okay, I get it now.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.020]   So now that you explained to me how just by reason
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.360]   I can figure out what a cube would be like,
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.600]   like a three-dimensional version of me,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.320]   let's figure out what a four-dimensional version
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.720]   of me would be like.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.960]   And then the sphere's like,
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.800]   what the hell are you talking about?
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.480]   There's no fourth dimension, that's ridiculous.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.720]   Like, there's only three dimensions.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.240]   Like, that's how many there are, I can see.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.840]   Like, I mean, so it's this sort of comic moment
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.640]   where the sphere is completely unable to conceptualize
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.900]   that there could actually be yet another dimension.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.880]   So yeah, that takes the religious allegory
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.920]   to like a very weird place
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.180]   that I don't really like understand theologically, but.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.120]   - That's a nice way to talk about religion and myth
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.000]   in general as perhaps us trying to struggle,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.440]   us meaning human civilization,
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.480]   trying to struggle with ideas
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.640]   that are beyond our cognitive capabilities.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   - But it's in fact not beyond our capability.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.320]   It may be beyond our cognitive capabilities
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.480]   to visualize a four-dimensional cube,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.360]   a tesseract as some like to call it,
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.840]   or a five-dimensional cube or a six-dimensional cube,
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.000]   but it is not beyond our cognitive capabilities
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.680]   to figure out how many corners
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.080]   a six-dimensional cube would have.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.420]   That's what's so cool about us.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.080]   Whether we can visualize it or not,
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.440]   we can still talk about it, we can still reason about it,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.200]   we can still figure things out about it.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.280]   That's amazing.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.160]   - Yeah, if we go back to this,
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.680]   first of all to the mug,
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.020]   but to the example you give in the book of the straw,
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.800]   how many holes does a straw have?
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.120]   And you, listener, may try to answer that in your own head.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.120]   - Yeah, I'm gonna take a drink
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.240]   while everybody thinks about it
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.080]   so we can give you a moment.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.020]   - A slow sip.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe?
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.660]   Maybe you get very creative.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.660]   But it's kind of interesting to dissecting each answer
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.100]   as you do in the book.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.540]   It's quite brilliant, people should definitely check it out.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.460]   But if you could try to answer it now,
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.300]   think about all the options
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.440]   and why they may or may not be right.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.280]   - Yeah, and it's one of these questions
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.300]   where people on first hearing it think it's a triviality
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.780]   and they're like, well, the answer is obvious.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.620]   And then what happens,
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.620]   if you ever ask a group of people this,
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.980]   something wonderfully comic happens,
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.820]   which is that everyone's like,
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.500]   well, it's completely obvious.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.980]   And then each person realizes that half the person,
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.820]   the other people in the room
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.980]   have a different obvious answer
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.900]   for the way they have.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.420]   And then people get really heated.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.100]   People are like, I can't believe
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.460]   that you think it has two holes.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.660]   Or like, I can't believe that you think it has one.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.740]   And then you really,
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.420]   people really learn something about each other.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.440]   And people get heated.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.740]   - I mean, can we go through the possible options here?
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.300]   Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.660]   - Sure, so I think most people,
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.100]   the zero holers are rare.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.740]   They would say like, well, look,
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.180]   you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.060]   and closing it up.
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.760]   Rectangular piece of plastic doesn't have a hole in it.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.980]   I didn't poke a hole in it.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.300]   So how can I have a hole?
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.580]   They'd be like, it's just one thing.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.940]   Okay, most people don't see it that way.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.780]   That's like--
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.860]   - Is there any truth to that kind of conception?
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.460]   - Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's a count.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:29.300]   I mean,
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.340]   what I would say is you could say the same thing
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.460]   about a bagel.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.220]   You could say, I can make a bagel by taking
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.060]   a long cylinder of dough, which doesn't have a hole,
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.720]   and then smushing the ends together.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.060]   Now it's a bagel.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.420]   So if you're really committed, you can be like,
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.700]   okay, a bagel doesn't have a hole either.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.140]   But who are you if you say a bagel doesn't have a hole?
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:54.980]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.820]   - Yeah, so that's almost like
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.000]   an engineering definition of it.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.020]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.240]   So what about the other options?
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.580]   - So one-hole people would say--
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.900]   - I like how these are like groups of people,
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.700]   like we've planted our foot.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.940]   This is what we stand for.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.260]   There's books written about each belief.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.540]   - You know, would say, look, there's a hole,
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.900]   and it goes all the way through the straw, right?
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.920]   There's one region of space that's the hole,
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.760]   and there's one.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.140]   And two-hole people would say, well, look,
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.340]   there's a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.540]   I think a common thing you see when people
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.980]   argue about this, they would take something like this
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.820]   bottle of water I'm holding, and they'll open it.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.540]   And they say, well, how many holes are there in this?
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.580]   And you say, well, there's one.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.100]   There's one hole at the top.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.380]   Okay, what if I poke a hole here
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.940]   so that all the water spills out?
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.300]   Well, now it's a straw.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.140]   So if you're a one-holer, I say to you,
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.020]   well, how many holes are in it now?
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.340]   There was one hole in it before,
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.260]   and I poked a new hole in it.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.580]   And then you think there's still one hole,
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.700]   even though there was one hole and I made one more?
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.260]   - Clearly not, there's just two holes, yeah.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.540]   - And yet, if you're a two-holer,
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.740]   the one-holer will say, okay, where does one hole begin
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.900]   and the other hole end?
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:18.660]   And in the book, I sort of, in math,
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:19.980]   there's two things we do when we're faced
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.740]   with a problem that's confusing us.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.540]   We can make the problem simpler.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.740]   That's what we were doing a minute ago
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.100]   when we were talking about high-dimensional space,
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.100]   and I was like, let's talk about circles and line segments.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.740]   Let's go down a dimension to make it easier.
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.100]   The other big move we have is to make the problem harder
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.700]   and try to sort of really face up
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.660]   to what are the complications.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.580]   So what I do in the book is say,
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.260]   let's stop talking about straws for a minute
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.700]   and talk about pants.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.240]   How many holes are there in a pair of pants?
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.820]   So I think most people who say there's two holes in a straw
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.020]   would say there's three holes in a pair of pants.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.020]   I guess we're filming only from here.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.580]   I could take up, no, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.780]   You'll just have to imagine the pants, sorry.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.360]   Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.220]   (laughing)
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.620]   - That's gonna be in the director's cut.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:06.380]   It's a Patreon-only footage.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.860]   There you go.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.520]   - So many people would say there's three holes
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.940]   in a pair of pants, but for instance,
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.000]   my daughter, when I asked this,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.860]   by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.380]   I highly recommend it.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.900]   - What did she say?
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.380]   - She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.660]   just has two holes because yes, there's the waist,
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.660]   but that's just the two leg holes stuck together.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.540]   - Whoa, okay.
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.820]   - Two leg holes, yeah, okay.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.660]   - Right, I mean, that really is a good combination.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.380]   - 'Cause she's a one-holer for the straw.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.480]   - So she's a one-holer for the straw too.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   And that really does capture something.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.900]   It captures this fact, which is central
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.460]   to the theory of what's called homology,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.120]   which is like a central part of modern topology,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.740]   that holes, whatever we may mean by them,
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.980]   they're somehow things which have an arithmetic to them.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.960]   They're things which can be added,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.220]   like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.380]   is kind of an equation, but it's not an equation
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.940]   about numbers, it's an equation about some kind of geometric,
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.460]   some kind of topological thing, which is very strange.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.980]   And so, when I come down, like a rabbi,
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.180]   I like to kind of like come up with these answers
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.300]   and somehow like dodge the original question
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.900]   and say like, you're both right, my children.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.740]   Okay, so.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:23.500]   So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:28.020]   would say is like, the first version would be to say like,
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.300]   well, there are two holes,
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.380]   but they're really both the same hole.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.300]   Well, that's not quite right.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.780]   A better way to say it is, there's two holes,
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.540]   but one is the negative of the other.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.740]   Now, what can that mean?
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.220]   One way of thinking about what it means
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.380]   is that if you sip something like a milkshake
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.460]   through the straw, no matter what,
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.980]   the amount of milkshake that's flowing in one end,
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.420]   that same amount is flowing out the other end.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.820]   So they're not independent from each other.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.700]   There's some relationship between them.
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.780]   In the same way that if you somehow could like suck
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.160]   a milkshake through a pair of pants,
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.980]   the amount of milkshake, just go with me on this.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.660]   - I'm right there with you.
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.700]   - The amount of milkshake that's coming in
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.340]   the left leg of the pants,
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.100]   plus the amount of milkshake that's coming in
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.700]   the right leg of the pants,
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.780]   is the same that's coming out the waist of the pants.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.300]   - So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.580]   The last three days.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.580]   So I just broke the fast
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.780]   with a little bit of food yesterday.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.460]   So this is like, this sounds,
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.780]   food analogies or metaphors for this podcast
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.740]   work wonderfully 'cause I can intensely picture it.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:36.860]   - Is that your weekly routine
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.840]   or just in preparation for talking about geometry
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:39.680]   for three hours?
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.900]   - Exactly, it's just for this.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.140]   It's hardship to purify the mind.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:45.220]   No, it's for the first time.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:46.700]   I just wanted to try the experience.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.540]   - Oh, wow.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.820]   - And just to pause, to do things
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:52.060]   that are out of the ordinary,
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.980]   to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.220]   to be just alive and be able to do all the cool shit
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.060]   that I get to do.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.340]   - Did you drink water?
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.020]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.540]   Water and salt.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.180]   So like electrolytes and all those kinds of things.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.620]   But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.620]   equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.900]   - Exactly, so this idea that,
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.980]   I mean, I think, you know,
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.340]   Poincaré really had this idea,
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.820]   this sort of modern idea,
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.020]   I mean, building on stuff other people did,
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.700]   Betty is an important one,
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.900]   of this kind of modern notion of relations between wholes.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.260]   But the idea that wholes really had an arithmetic,
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:35.540]   the really modern view was really Emmy Noether's idea.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.380]   So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.300]   on its modern footing that we have now.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.220]   So, you know, it's always a challenge.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.380]   You know, in the book,
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.620]   I'm not gonna say I give like a course
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.300]   so that you read this chapter and then you're like,
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.940]   oh, it's just like I took like a semester
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.100]   of algebraic topology.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:53.940]   It's not like this.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.380]   And it's always a challenge writing about math
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.060]   because there are some things
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.300]   that you can really do on the page and the math is there.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.260]   And there's other things which,
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.500]   it's too much in a book like this
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.380]   to like do them all the page.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.140]   You can only say something about them,
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.140]   if that makes sense.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.780]   So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.620]   I try to,
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.780]   topics that are,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:22.100]   you can't really compress and really truly say
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.460]   exactly what they are in this amount of space.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.020]   I try to say something interesting about them,
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.180]   something meaningful about them
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.780]   so that readers can get the flavor.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.460]   And then in other places,
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.660]   I really try to get up close and personal
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.260]   and really do the math and have it take place on the page.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.140]   - To some degree, be able to give inklings
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.860]   of the beauty of the subject.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.260]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of books that are like,
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.740]   I don't quite know how to express this well.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.020]   I'm still laboring to do it,
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:56.020]   but there's a lot of books that are about stuff,
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:00.980]   but I want my books to not only be about stuff,
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.580]   but to actually have some stuff there on the page
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.580]   in the book for people to interact with directly
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.700]   and not just sort of hear me talk about distant features,
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.460]   about distant features of it.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.660]   - Right, so not be talking just about ideas,
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.860]   but actually be expressing the idea.
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.700]   Is there, you know somebody in the,
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.420]   maybe you can comment, there's a guy,
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:25.500]   his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.900]   He does that masterfully well.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.740]   - Absolutely.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.620]   - Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.540]   and then talking about it as well, back and forth.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.020]   What do you think about Grant?
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:37.980]   - It's fantastic.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.180]   I mean, the flowering of math YouTube
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.460]   is like such a wonderful thing
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.700]   because math teaching,
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.020]   there's so many different venues
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.860]   through which we can teach people math.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.780]   There's the traditional one, right?
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.540]   Well, where I'm in a classroom with,
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.420]   depending on the class, it could be 30 people,
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.700]   it could be 100 people,
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.460]   it could, God help me, be 500 people
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.860]   if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:02.700]   And there's sort of some,
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:05.060]   but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude.
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.460]   And I'm with them, we have a long time.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.340]   I'm with them for a whole semester
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.300]   and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.140]   We have office hours,
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.500]   if they have one-on-one questions, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.500]   It's like a very high level of engagement,
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.180]   but how many people am I actually hitting at a time?
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.300]   Like not that many, right?
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.940]   And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.740]   where the more, the fewer people you're talking to,
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.300]   the more engagement you can ask for.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.020]   The ultimate, of course, is like the mentorship relation
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:35.020]   of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.020]   where you spend a lot of one-on-one time together
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.180]   for like three to five years.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.820]   And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:50.420]   You know, books, this can get to a lot more people
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.700]   that are ever gonna sit in my classroom
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:56.700]   and you spend like however many hours
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.700]   it takes to read a book.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:01.140]   Somebody like 3Blue1Brown or Numberphile
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.140]   or people like Vi Hart.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.980]   I mean, YouTube, let's face it,
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.900]   has bigger reach than a book.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.660]   Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many,
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.320]   many more views than like any hardback book
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.820]   like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:16.660]   is gonna sell, right?
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.580]   So that's, I mean.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:23.340]   And then, you know, those are, you know,
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.540]   some of them are like longer, 20 minutes long,
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.580]   some of them are five minutes long,
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.820]   but they're shorter.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.740]   And then even somebody like, look, like Eugenia Chang
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.540]   is a wonderful category theorist in Chicago.
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.620]   I mean, she was on, I think, The Daily Show or is it?
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.820]   I mean, she was on, you know, she has 30 seconds,
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.620]   but then there's like 30 seconds to sort of say
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.380]   something about mathematics to like untold
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.220]   millions of people.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.980]   So everywhere along this curve is important.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.580]   And one thing I feel like is great right now
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.220]   is that people are just broadcasting on all the channels
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.900]   because we each have our skills, right?
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.820]   Somehow along the way, like I learned how to write books.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:55.700]   I had this kind of weird life as a writer
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.100]   where I sort of spent a lot of time
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.620]   like thinking about how to put English words together
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.860]   into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs,
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:04.940]   like at length, which is this kind of like weird
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.900]   specialized skill.
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.100]   And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.980]   like, you know, winning good looking eye catching videos
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.020]   is like a totally different skill.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.700]   And, you know, probably, you know, somewhere out there,
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:19.500]   there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.780]   that's like teaching math through heavy metal
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.300]   and like using their skills to do that.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.020]   I hope there is at any rate.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.540]   - Their music and so on, yeah.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.780]   But there is something to the process.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.700]   I mean, Grant does this especially well,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:36.380]   which is in order to be able to visualize something,
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.540]   now he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.900]   So like the things he is basically mostly
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.300]   through his Manum library in Python,
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.280]   everything is drawn through Python.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:54.340]   You have to truly understand the topic to be able
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:59.700]   to visualize it in that way and not just understand it,
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.380]   but really kind of think in a very novel way.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.540]   It's funny 'cause I've spoken with him a couple of times,
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.860]   spoken to him a lot offline as well.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.100]   He really doesn't think he's doing anything new,
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.380]   meaning like he sees himself as very different
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.260]   from maybe like a researcher,
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:25.460]   but it feels to me like he's creating something
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.980]   totally new, like that act of understanding
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.220]   and visualizing is as powerful or has the same kind
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.660]   of inkling of power as does the process
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.920]   of proving something.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.940]   It doesn't have that clear destination,
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:43.980]   but it's pulling out an insight and creating multiple sets
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.140]   of perspective that arrive at that insight.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.220]   - And to be honest, it's something that I think
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:53.340]   we haven't quite figured out how to value
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.380]   inside academic mathematics in the same way,
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.300]   and this is a bit older, that I think we haven't quite
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.460]   figured out how to value the development
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.020]   of computational infrastructure.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.900]   We all have computers as our partners now,
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.820]   and people build computers that sort of assist
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.260]   and participate in our mathematics.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.660]   They build those systems, and that's a kind
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.980]   of mathematics too, but not in the traditional form
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.380]   of proving theorems and writing papers.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.500]   But I think it's coming.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.300]   I mean, I think, for example, the Institute
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.900]   for Computational Experimental Mathematics at Brown,
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.780]   which is like a, you know, it's a NSF-funded math institute,
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.820]   very much part of sort of traditional math academia.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.700]   They did an entire theme semester
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.900]   about visualizing mathematics, like the same kind
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.980]   of thing that they would do for like an up-and-coming
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.500]   research topic, like that's pretty cool.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.220]   So I think there really is buy-in
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.940]   from the mathematics community to recognize
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.380]   that this kind of stuff is important
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.500]   and counts as part of mathematics,
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.540]   like part of what we're actually here to do.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.980]   - Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.380]   from like MIT faculty, from faculty
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.500]   from all the top universities in the world.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.980]   Let me ask you this weird question about the Fields Medal,
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.920]   which is the Nobel Prize in mathematics.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.500]   Do you think, since we're talking about computers,
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   there will one day come a time when a computer,
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.080]   an AI system, will win a Fields Medal?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.860]   - No.
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.420]   (Lex laughs)
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.700]   - That's what a human would say.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.540]   Why not?
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.360]   (Lex laughs)
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.380]   - Is that like, that's like my cap shot,
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.500]   that's like the proof that I'm a human,
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.340]   is I deny that I'm not?
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.820]   (Lex laughs)
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.940]   - What is, how does he want me to answer?
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.980]   Is there something interesting to be said about that?
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.660]   - Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.860]   in what AI can do in pure mathematics.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.540]   I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial interest, right?
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.100]   You're like, why am I not interested in like how it can
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.460]   like help feed the world or help solve like real-world
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.180]   problems, I'm like, can it do more math?
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.580]   Like, what can I do?
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.620]   We all have our interests, right?
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.720]   But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.720]   And here too, I think it's important to be kind of
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.800]   historical, because it's certainly true that there's lots
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.920]   of things that we used to call research in mathematics
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.400]   that we would now call computation.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.720]   Tasks that we've now offloaded to machines, like, you know,
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.780]   in 1890, somebody could be like, here's my PhD thesis,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:18.200]   I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.900]   under the action of some finite group,
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.380]   doesn't matter what those words mean,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.040]   just it's like some thing that in 1890 would take a person
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.200]   a year to do and would be a valuable thing
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.040]   that you might wanna know.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.900]   And it's still a valuable thing that you might wanna know,
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:34.700]   but now you type a few lines of code in Macaulay or Sage
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.720]   or Magma, and you just have it.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.240]   So we don't think of that as math anymore,
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.640]   even though it's the same thing.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.360]   - What's Macaulay, Sage and Magma?
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.020]   - Oh, those are computer algebra programs.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.860]   So those are like sort of bespoke systems
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.100]   that lots of mathematicians use.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.580]   - Is that similar to Maple and Mathematica?
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.580]   - Yeah, oh yeah, so it's similar to Maple and Mathematica,
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.700]   yeah, but a little more specialized, but yeah.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.620]   - It's programs that work with symbols
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.140]   and allow you to do, can you do proofs?
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.060]   Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs?
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.420]   - They're not really built for that,
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.780]   and that's a whole other story.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.380]   - But these tools are part of the process
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.300]   of mathematics now.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.440]   - Right, they are now, for most mathematicians,
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.620]   I would say, part of the process of mathematics.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.740]   And so, you know, there's a story I tell in the book
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.740]   which I'm fascinated by, which is, you know,
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   so far, attempts to get AIs to prove interesting theorems
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:27.260]   have not done so well.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.100]   It doesn't mean they can't.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.700]   There's actually a paper I just saw,
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.420]   which has a very nice use of a neural net
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.580]   to find counter examples to conjecture.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.180]   Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.260]   And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.140]   to sort of try to find things where that's not true,
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:43.980]   and it actually succeeded.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.880]   Now, in this case, if you look at the things that it found,
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.360]   you say like, okay, I mean,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.600]   these are not famous conjectures, okay?
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.200]   So like, somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.880]   Looking at what the AI came up with, you're like,
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.720]   you know, I'll bet if like five grad students
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.680]   had thought about that problem,
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.520]   they wouldn't have come up with that.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.800]   I mean, when you see it, you're like,
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.400]   okay, that is one of the things you might try
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.480]   if you sort of like put some work into it.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.600]   Still, it's pretty awesome.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.800]   But the story I tell in the book,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   which I'm fascinated by is there is,
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.480]   okay, we're gonna go back to knots.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.320]   - It's cool.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.920]   - There's a knot called the Conway knot.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.400]   After John Conway, who maybe we'll talk about
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400]   a very interesting character also.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.160]   - Yeah, it's a small tangent.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.480]   Somebody I was supposed to talk to,
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.760]   and unfortunately he passed away,
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.240]   and he's somebody I find as an incredible mathematician,
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   incredible human being.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.320]   - Oh, and I am sorry that you didn't get a chance
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   because having had the chance to talk to him a lot
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.140]   when I was a postdoc, yeah, you missed out.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.160]   There was no way to sugarcoat it.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.640]   I'm sorry that you didn't get that chance.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.920]   - Yeah, it is what it is.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.120]   So, knots.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.520]   - Yeah, so there was a question,
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.860]   and again, it doesn't matter the technicalities
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.000]   of the question, but it's a question
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.320]   of whether the knot is sliced.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.960]   It has to do with something about what kinds
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.340]   of three-dimensional surfaces in four dimensions
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.480]   can be bounded by this knot.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.360]   But never mind what it means.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.720]   It's some question, and it's actually very hard
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.540]   to compute whether a knot is sliced or not.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.900]   And in particular, the question of the Conway knot,
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.320]   whether it was sliced or not, was particularly vexed.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.620]   Until it was solved just a few years ago
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.260]   by Lisa Piccirillo, who actually,
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.700]   now that I think of it, was here in Austin.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.980]   I believe she was a grad student at UT Austin at the time.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.540]   I didn't even realize there was an Austin connection
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.100]   to this story until I started telling it.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.780]   In fact, I think she's now at MIT,
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.140]   so she's basically following you around.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.820]   If I remember correctly. - The reverse.
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.340]   - There's a lot of really interesting richness
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.660]   to this story.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.580]   One thing about it is her paper was rather,
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.860]   was very short.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.100]   It was very short and simple.
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.060]   Nine pages, of which two were pictures.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.580]   Very short for a paper solving a major conjecture.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.860]   And it really makes you think about what we mean
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.380]   by difficulty in mathematics.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.420]   Do you say, oh, actually the problem wasn't difficult
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.820]   because you could solve it so simply?
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.260]   Or do you say, well no, evidently it was difficult
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.980]   because the world's top topologist worked on it
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.340]   for 20 years and nobody could solve it,
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.540]   so therefore it is difficult.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.460]   Or is it that we need some new category of things
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.500]   about which it's difficult to figure out
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.700]   that they're not difficult?
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.640]   - I mean, this is the computer science formulation,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   but the journey to arrive at the simple answer
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   may be difficult, but once you have the answer,
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.720]   it will then appear simple.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.620]   And I mean, there might be a large category,
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.620]   I hope there's a large set of such solutions,
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:42.380]   because once we stand at the end of the scientific process
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:46.100]   that we're at the very beginning of,
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.540]   or at least it feels like,
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:50.140]   I hope there's just simple answers to everything.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.580]   That we'll look and it'll be simple laws
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.100]   that govern the universe,
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:58.020]   simple explanation of what is consciousness,
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:02.340]   of what is love, is mortality fundamental to life,
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.880]   what's the meaning of life,
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.020]   are humans special or we're just another
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.500]   sort of reflection of all that is beautiful
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.220]   in the universe in terms of life forms,
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.380]   all of it is life and just has different,
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.900]   when taken from a different perspective,
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.460]   is all life can seem more valuable or not,
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.180]   but really it's all part of the same thing.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.520]   All those will have a nice two equations,
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.100]   maybe one equation.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.800]   - Why do you think you want those questions
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.740]   to have simple answers?
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:36.780]   - I think just like symmetry and the breaking of symmetry
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.160]   is beautiful somehow,
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.420]   there's something beautiful about simplicity.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.260]   I think it--
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.420]   - So it's aesthetic.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.580]   - It's aesthetic, yeah.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:49.620]   But it's aesthetic in the way that happiness is an aesthetic.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:55.380]   Why is that so joyful that a simple explanation
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:00.720]   that governs a large number of cases is really appealing?
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.380]   Even when it's not,
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.320]   like obviously we get a huge amount of trouble with that
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.420]   because oftentimes it doesn't have to be connected
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.460]   with reality or even that explanation
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.560]   could be exceptionally harmful.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.140]   Most of like the world's history
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.980]   that was governed by hate and violence
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.940]   had a very simple explanation at the core
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.940]   that was used to cause the violence and the hatred.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.740]   So like we get into trouble with that,
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.380]   but why is that so appealing?
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.820]   And in its nice forms in mathematics,
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.580]   like you look at the Einstein papers,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.020]   why are those so beautiful?
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.860]   And why is the Andrew Wiles'
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:43.240]   proof of the Fermat's last theorem not quite so beautiful?
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.620]   Like what's beautiful about that story
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.940]   is the human struggle of like the human story
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.700]   of perseverance, of the drama,
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.900]   of not knowing if the proof is correct
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.060]   and ups and downs and all of those kinds of things.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.220]   That's the interesting part.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.380]   But the fact that the proof is huge and nobody understand,
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.220]   well, from my outsider's perspective,
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.180]   nobody understands what the heck it is,
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.700]   is not as beautiful as it could have been.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.220]   I wish it was what Fermat originally said,
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:14.220]   which is, you know, it's not small enough
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.200]   to fit in the margins of this page,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.300]   but maybe if he had like a full page
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.820]   or maybe a couple of post-it notes,
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.940]   he would have enough to do the proof.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.860]   What do you make of,
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.740]   if we could take another of a multitude of tangents,
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.260]   what do you make of Fermat's last theorem?
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.660]   Because the statement, there's a few theorems,
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:35.540]   there's a few problems that are deemed by the world
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.780]   throughout its history to be exceptionally difficult.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:42.380]   And that one in particular is really simple to formulate
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:46.260]   and really hard to come up with a proof for.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:51.260]   And it was like taunted as simple by Fermat himself.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.860]   Is there something interesting to be said
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.780]   about that X to the N plus Y to the N
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.140]   equals Z to the N for N of three or greater.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.540]   Is there a solution to this?
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.300]   And then how do you go about proving that?
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:08.140]   Like, how would you try to prove that?
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.940]   And what do you learn from the proof
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.100]   that eventually emerged by Andrew Wiles?
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.380]   - Yeah, so right, let me just say the background,
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.020]   'cause I don't know if everybody listening knows the story.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:21.940]   So, you know, Fermat was an early number theorist,
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.100]   at least sort of an early mathematician.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.060]   Those special adjacent didn't really exist back then.
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.420]   He comes up in the book actually in the context
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.620]   of a different theorem of his that has to do with testing
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620]   whether a number is prime or not.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.420]   So I write about, he was one of the ones who was salty
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.460]   and like he would exchange these letters
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.140]   where he and his correspondence would like
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.100]   try to top each other and vex each other with questions
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.940]   and stuff like this.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.020]   But this particular thing,
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.300]   it's called Fermat's last theorem
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.660]   because it's a note he wrote
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.380]   in his copy of the "Disquisitonis Arithmeticae."
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.860]   Like he wrote, "Here's an equation.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.780]   "It has no solutions.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.260]   "I can prove it, but the proof's like a little too long
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.540]   "to fit in the margin of this book."
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.140]   He was just like writing a note to himself.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.580]   Now, let me just say historically,
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.620]   we know that Fermat did not have a proof of this theorem.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.420]   For a long time, people were like,
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.020]   this mysterious proof that was lost,
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.260]   a very romantic story, right?
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:22.260]   But Fermat later, he did prove special cases of this theorem
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:27.380]   and wrote about it, talked to people about the problem.
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.100]   It's very clear from the way that he wrote
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.740]   where he can solve certain examples
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.140]   of this type of equation
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.740]   that he did not know how to do the whole thing.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:39.940]   - He may have had a deep, simple intuition
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.820]   about how to solve the whole thing
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.820]   that he had at that moment
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:47.060]   without ever being able to come up with a complete proof.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.100]   And that intuition maybe lost the time.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.900]   - Maybe.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.540]   But I think we, but you're right, that that is unknowable.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.980]   But I think what we can know is that later,
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.140]   he certainly did not think that he had a proof
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.660]   that he was concealing from people.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.380]   He thought he didn't know how to prove it,
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.420]   and I also think he didn't know how to prove it.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:10.260]   Now, I understand the appeal of saying,
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.580]   wouldn't it be cool if this very simple equation,
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.060]   there was a very simple, clever, wonderful proof
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.420]   that you could do in a page or two.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.020]   And that would be great, but you know what?
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.380]   There's lots of equations like that
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.220]   that are solved by very clever methods like that,
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.380]   including the special cases that Fermat wrote about,
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.900]   the method of descent, which is very wonderful.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.740]   But in the end, those are nice things
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.940]   that you teach in an undergraduate class,
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:37.020]   and it is what it is, but they're not big.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:41.620]   On the other hand, work on the Fermat problem,
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.460]   that's what we like to call it,
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.100]   because it's not really his theorem,
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.020]   because we don't think he proved it.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:49.220]   I mean, work on the Fermat problem
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.380]   and develop this incredible richness of number theory
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.060]   that we now live in today.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.340]   And not, by the way, just Wiles, Andrew Wiles being
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.700]   the person who, together with Richard Taylor,
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.780]   finally proved this theorem.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.260]   But you have this whole moment
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.560]   that people try to prove this theorem and they fail,
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.780]   and there's a famous false proof by LeMay
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:11.460]   from the 19th century where Kummer,
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.500]   in understanding what mistake LeMay had made
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.320]   in this incorrect proof,
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.340]   basically understands something incredible,
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.940]   which is that a thing we know about numbers
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:24.500]   is that you can factor them,
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.940]   and you can factor them uniquely.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.300]   There's only one way to break a number up into primes.
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.260]   Like if we think of a number like 12,
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.500]   12 is two times three times two.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.700]   I had to think about it.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   Or it's two times two times three,
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.580]   of course you can reorder them.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.220]   But there's no other way to do it.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.140]   There's no universe in which 12 is something times five,
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:47.520]   or in which there's like four threes in it.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.160]   Nope, 12 is like two twos and a three.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.700]   Like that is what it is.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.820]   And that's such a fundamental feature of arithmetic
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.540]   that we almost think of it like God's law.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.380]   You know what I mean?
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.200]   It has to be that way.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.660]   - That's a really powerful idea.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.540]   It's so cool that every number
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.740]   is uniquely made up of other numbers.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:08.380]   And like made up meaning,
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:12.820]   like there's these like basic atoms that form molecules
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.420]   that get built on top of each other.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.240]   - I love it.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.100]   I teach undergraduate number theory.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.240]   It's like, it's the first really deep theorem
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.600]   that you prove.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.520]   What's amazing is the fact that you can factor
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.020]   a number into primes is much easier.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.380]   Essentially Euclid knew it,
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.740]   although he didn't quite put it in that way.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.900]   The fact that you can do it at all.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.860]   What's deep is the fact that there's only one way to do it.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.680]   Or however you sort of chop the number up,
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.480]   you end up with the same set of prime factors.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:48.300]   And indeed what people finally understood
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.960]   at the end of the 19th century is that
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.680]   if you work in number systems slightly more general
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.180]   than the ones we're used to,
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:00.340]   which it turns out are relevant to Fermat,
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.120]   all of a sudden this stops being true.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.000]   Things get, I mean, things get more complicated.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.040]   And now because you were praising simplicity before,
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.920]   you were like, it's so beautiful, unique factorization.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.760]   It's so great.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.020]   It's like, it's when I tell you that
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:16.660]   in more general number systems
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.340]   there is no unique factorization,
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.340]   maybe you're like, that's bad.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:20.220]   I'm like, no, that's good.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.540]   Because there's like a whole new world of phenomena
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.100]   to study that you just can't see through the lens
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.980]   of the numbers that we're used to.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.940]   So I'm for complication.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.620]   I'm highly in favor of complication.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.620]   Every complication is like an opportunity
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.900]   for new things to study.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.320]   - And is that the big,
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.540]   kind of one of the big insights for you
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.900]   from Andrew Wiles' proof?
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.280]   Is there interesting insights about the process
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.580]   that you used to prove that sort of resonates
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.360]   with you as a mathematician?
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.400]   Is there an interesting concept that emerged from it?
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.140]   Is there interesting human aspects to the proof?
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.860]   - Whether there's interesting human aspects
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.640]   to the proof itself is an interesting question.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.520]   Certainly it has a huge amount of richness.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.680]   Sort of at its heart is an argument
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.040]   of what's called deformation theory.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:17.420]   Which was in part created by my PhD advisor, Barry Mazur.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.160]   - Can you speak to what deformation theory is?
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.920]   - I can speak to what it's like.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.920]   - Sure. - How about that?
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.640]   - What does it rhyme with?
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.320]   - Right, well, the reason that Barry called it
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.460]   deformation theory, I think he's the one
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.860]   who gave it the name.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.320]   I hope I'm not wrong in saying some day.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.120]   - In your book, you have calling different things
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.860]   by the same name as one of the things
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.400]   in the beautiful map that opens the book.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.040]   - Yes, and this is a perfect example.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.080]   So this is another phrase of Poincaré,
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.800]   this incredible generator of slogans and aphorisms.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.320]   He said, "Mathematics is the art of calling
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.880]   "different things by the same name."
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.520]   That very thing we do, right?
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.000]   When we're like this triangle and this triangle,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.040]   come on, they're the same triangle,
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.520]   they're just in a different place, right?
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.440]   So in the same way, it came to be understood
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.160]   that the kinds of objects that you study
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:10.200]   when you study Fermat's last theorem,
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.120]   and let's not even be too careful
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.720]   about what these objects are.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.760]   I can tell you they are Galois representations
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.400]   in modular forms, but saying those words
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.700]   is not gonna mean so much.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.680]   But whatever they are, they're things
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.900]   that can be deformed, moved around a little bit.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.440]   And I think the insight of what Andrew,
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.280]   and then Andrew and Richard were able to do,
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.680]   was to say something like this.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.680]   A deformation means moving something just a tiny bit,
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.140]   like an infinitesimal amount.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.440]   If you really are good at understanding
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.680]   which ways a thing can move in a tiny, tiny, tiny,
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.760]   infinitesimal amount in certain directions,
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.240]   maybe you can piece that information together
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.200]   to understand the whole global space
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.520]   in which it can move.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.400]   And essentially, their argument comes down
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.320]   to showing that two of those big global spaces
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.080]   are actually the same, the fabled R equals T
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.360]   part of their proof, which is at the heart of it.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.560]   And it involves this very careful principle like that.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.880]   But that being said, what I just said,
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.640]   it's probably not what you're thinking,
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.280]   because what you're thinking when you think,
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.500]   oh, I have a point in space and I move it around
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.700]   like a little tiny bit,
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:26.720]   you're using your notion of distance
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.320]   that's from calculus.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.180]   We know what it means for two points in the real line
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.960]   to be close together.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.080]   So yet another thing that comes up in the book a lot
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.200]   is this fact that the notion of distance
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.600]   is not given to us by God.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.640]   We could mean a lot of different things by distance.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.520]   And just in the English language, we do that all the time.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.020]   We talk about somebody being a close relative.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.040]   It doesn't mean they live next door to you, right?
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.800]   It means something else.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.840]   There's a different notion of distance we have in mind.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.520]   And there are lots of notions of distances
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.840]   that you could use.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.560]   In the natural language processing community in AI,
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.120]   there might be some notion of semantic distance
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.340]   or lexical distance between two words.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.720]   How much do they tend to arise in the same context?
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.440]   That's incredibly important for doing auto-complete
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440]   and machine translation and stuff like that.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.400]   And it doesn't have anything to do with,
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.960]   are they next to each other in the dictionary?
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.260]   It's a different kind of distance.
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:20.100]   Okay, ready?
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.840]   In this kind of number theory,
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.120]   there was a crazy distance called the P-adic distance.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.760]   I didn't write about this that much in the book,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.580]   because even though I love it
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.640]   and it's a big part of my research life,
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.760]   it gets a little bit into the weeds,
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.520]   but your listeners are gonna hear about it now.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.360]   - Please.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.920]   - Where, you know, what a normal person says
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.740]   when they say two numbers are close,
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:38.920]   they say like, you know,
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.260]   their difference is like a small number,
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.720]   like seven and eight are close,
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.420]   because their difference is one and one's pretty small.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.600]   If we were to be what's called a two-adic number theorist,
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.920]   we'd say, oh, two numbers are close
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.180]   if their difference is a multiple of a large power of two.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.920]   So like one and 49 are close
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.000]   because their difference is 48,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.800]   and 48 is a multiple of 16,
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.680]   which is a pretty large power of two.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.720]   Whereas one and two are pretty far away
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.480]   because the difference between them is one,
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.240]   which is not even a multiple of a power of two at all.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.600]   It's odd.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.680]   You wanna know what's really far from one?
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.560]   Like one and 1/64,
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.720]   because their difference is a negative power of two,
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.640]   two to the minus six.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.400]   So those points are quite, quite far away.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.260]   - Two to the power of a large n would be two,
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:35.600]   if that's the difference between two numbers
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.120]   and they're close.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.200]   - Yeah, so two to a large power is,
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.640]   in this metric, a very small number,
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.800]   and two to a negative power is a very big number.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.760]   - That's two-adic, okay.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.680]   I can't even visualize that.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:49.680]   - It takes practice.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.520]   It takes practice.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.800]   If you've ever heard of the Cantor set,
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.160]   it looks kind of like that.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.280]   So it is crazy that this is good for anything, right?
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.840]   I mean, this just sounds like a definition
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.600]   that someone would make up to torment you.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.520]   But what's amazing is there's a general theory of distance
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.360]   where you say any definition you make
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.840]   that satisfies certain axioms
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.000]   deserves to be called a distance, and this--
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.840]   - See, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.440]   My brain, you broke my brain.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.520]   - Awesome.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.080]   - 10 seconds ago.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.380]   'Cause I'm also starting to map,
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.880]   for the two-adic case, to binary numbers,
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.280]   'cause we romanticize those.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.120]   So I was trying to--
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.280]   - Oh, that's exactly the right way to think of it.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.800]   - I was trying to mess with number,
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.840]   and I was trying to see, okay, which ones are close?
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.000]   And then I'm starting to visualize
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.620]   different binary numbers and how they,
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.320]   which ones are close to each other.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.520]   And I'm not sure, well, I think there's a--
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.560]   - No, no, it's very similar.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.960]   That's exactly the right way to think of it.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.520]   It's almost like binary numbers written in reverse.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.360]   - Right.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360]   - Because in a binary expansion, two numbers are close.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.840]   A number that's small is like .0000 something.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.680]   Something that's the decimal,
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.200]   and it starts with a lot of zeros.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.840]   In the two-adic metric, a binary number is very small
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.120]   if it ends with a lot of zeros,
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.680]   and then the decimal point.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.520]   - Gotcha.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.040]   - So it is kind of like binary numbers written backwards
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.480]   is actually, that's what I should have said, Lex.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.400]   (Lex laughing)
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.800]   That's a very good metaphor.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.040]   - No, you said, okay, but so why is that interesting,
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   except for the fact that it's a beautiful kind of framework,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.640]   different kind of framework
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.000]   of which to think about distances.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.120]   And you're talking about not just the two-adic,
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.320]   but the generalization of that.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320]   Why is that interesting? - Yeah, the NEP.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.400]   Because that's the kind of deformation that comes up
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.760]   in Wiles' proof, that deformation,
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.400]   where moving something a little bit
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.960]   means a little bit in this two-adic sense.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.160]   - Trippy, okay.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.160]   - No, I mean, I just get excited talking about it,
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.800]   and I just taught this in the fall semester.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.400]   - But reformulating, why is...
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.920]   So you pick a different measure of distance
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.080]   over which you can talk about very tiny changes,
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.760]   and then use that to then prove things
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.480]   about the entire thing.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.240]   - Yes, although, honestly, what I would say,
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.400]   I mean, it's true that we use it to prove things,
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.680]   but I would say we use it to understand things.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.600]   And then because we understand things better,
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.680]   then we can prove things.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.400]   But the goal is always the understanding.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.960]   The goal is not so much to prove things.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.880]   The goal is not to know what's true or false.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:20.920]   I mean, this is the thing I write about
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.760]   in the book "Near the End."
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.520]   I mean, it's something that, it's a wonderful,
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.600]   wonderful essay by Bill Thurston,
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.200]   kind of one of the great geometers of our time,
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.800]   who unfortunately passed away a few years ago,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.040]   called on proof and progress in mathematics.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.120]   And he writes very wonderfully about how,
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.040]   you know, it's not a theorem factory
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.600]   where we have a production quota.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.760]   I mean, the point of mathematics
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.440]   is to help humans understand things.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.280]   And the way we test that is that we're proving new theorems
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.520]   along the way, that's the benchmark,
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.040]   but that's not the goal.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.440]   - Yeah, but just as a kind of, absolutely,
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.920]   but as a tool, it's kind of interesting
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.440]   to approach a problem by saying,
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.780]   how can I change the distance function?
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:03.720]   Like what, the nature of distance,
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.080]   because that might start to lead to insights
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.400]   for deeper understanding.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.600]   Like if I were to try to describe human society
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.160]   by distance, two people are close if they love each other.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.000]   - Right.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.040]   - And then start to do a full analysis
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.840]   on everybody that lives on earth currently,
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.300]   the 7 billion people.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.680]   And from that perspective,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.840]   as opposed to the geographic perspective of distance,
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.000]   and then maybe there could be a bunch of insights
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.580]   about the source of violence,
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:40.080]   the source of maybe entrepreneurial success or invention
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.960]   or economic success or different systems,
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.680]   communism, capitalism, start to,
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.480]   I mean, that's, I guess, what economics tries to do,
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.520]   but really saying, okay, let's think outside the box
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.840]   about totally new distance functions
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.240]   that could unlock something profound about the space.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.620]   - Yeah, because think about it, okay, here's,
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:01.200]   I mean, now we're gonna talk about AI,
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.980]   which you know a lot more about than I do,
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.840]   so just start laughing uproariously
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.080]   if I say something that's completely wrong.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.840]   - We both know very little relative
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.600]   to what we will know centuries from now.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.720]   - That is a really good, humble way to think about it.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.360]   I like it, okay, so let's just go for it.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.520]   Okay, so I think you'll agree with this,
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.040]   that in some sense, what's good about AI
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.360]   is that we can't test any case in advance.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.840]   The whole point of AI is to make,
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.560]   or one point of it, I guess, is to make good predictions
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.640]   about cases we haven't yet seen.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.840]   And in some sense, that's always gonna involve
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.960]   some notion of distance,
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.840]   because it's always gonna involve
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.040]   somehow taking a case we haven't seen
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.840]   and saying what cases that we have seen is it close to,
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.820]   is it like, is it somehow an interpolation between.
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.960]   Now, when we do that, in order to talk about
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.040]   things being like other things,
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.480]   implicitly or explicitly,
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.600]   we're invoking some notion of distance,
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.640]   and boy, we better get it right.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.200]   If you try to do natural language processing
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.200]   and your idea of distance between words
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.160]   is how close they are in the dictionary,
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.440]   when you write them in alphabetical order,
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:08.160]   you are gonna get pretty bad translations, right?
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.520]   No, the notion of distance has to come from somewhere else.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.000]   - Yeah, that's essentially
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.120]   what neural networks are doing,
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.520]   that's what word embeddings are doing,
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.320]   is coming up with-- - Yes.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.760]   In the case of word embeddings, literally,
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.080]   like literally what they are doing
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.320]   is learning a distance-- - But those are
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.560]   super complicated distance functions,
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.200]   and it's almost nice to think
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:31.200]   maybe there's a nice transformation that's simple.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.480]   Sorry, there's a nice formulation of the distance.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.560]   - Again with the simple.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.740]   So you don't, let me ask you about this.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.400]   From an understanding perspective,
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.600]   there's the Richard Feynman, maybe attributed to him,
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.320]   but maybe many others,
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.440]   is this idea that if you can't explain something simply,
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.080]   that you don't understand it.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.680]   In how many cases, how often is that true?
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.080]   Do you find there's some profound truth in that?
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.680]   Oh, okay, so you were about to ask, is it true,
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.320]   to which I would say flatly no,
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.240]   but then you followed that up with,
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.200]   is there some profound truth in it?
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.400]   And I'm like, okay, sure, so there's some truth in it.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.200]   - But it's not true. - It's just not.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.440]   (laughing)
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.760]   - This is your mathematician answer.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.760]   - The truth that is in it is that learning
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.000]   to explain something helps you understand it.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.600]   But real things are not simple.
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.660]   A few things are, most are not.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.500]   And I don't, to be honest, I don't, I mean, I don't,
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.140]   we don't really know whether Feynman really said that,
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:43.100]   right, or something like that is sort of disputed,
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.220]   but I don't think Feynman could have literally believed that,
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.260]   whether or not he said it.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.040]   And you know, he was the kind of guy,
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.420]   I didn't know him, but I'm reading his writing,
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:55.060]   he liked to sort of say stuff, like stuff that sounded good.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:55.900]   You know what I mean?
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.660]   So it totally strikes me as the kind of thing
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:00.220]   he could have said because he liked the way saying it
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.280]   made him feel.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.540]   But also knowing that he didn't like literally mean it.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.820]   - Well, I definitely have a lot of friends
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.600]   and I've talked to a lot of physicists,
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.780]   and they do derive joy from believing
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.580]   that they can explain stuff simply.
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:17.860]   Or believing it's possible to explain stuff simply,
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:20.220]   even when the explanation's not actually that simple.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.980]   Like I've heard people think that the explanation's simple
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:27.620]   and they do the explanation, and I think it is simple,
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:30.620]   but it's not capturing the phenomena that we're discussing.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.100]   It's capturing, it somehow maps in their mind,
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.020]   but it's taking as a starting point,
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.220]   as an assumption that there's a deep knowledge
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:41.820]   and a deep understanding that's actually very complicated.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.260]   And the simplicity is almost like a poem
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.860]   about the more complicated thing,
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.740]   as opposed to a distillation.
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.740]   - And I love poems, but a poem is not an explanation.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.500]   (laughing)
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.580]   - Well, some people might disagree with that,
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.500]   but certainly from a mathematical perspective--
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.620]   - No poet would disagree with it.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.220]   - No poet would disagree.
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:02.740]   You don't think there's some things
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:06.540]   that can only be described imprecisely?
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:09.140]   - As an explanation, I don't think any poet
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.540]   would say their poem is an explanation.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.820]   They might say it's a description,
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.440]   they might say it's sort of capturing sort of--
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.700]   - Well, some people might say the only truth is like music.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.700]   Not the only truth, but some truth
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:23.580]   can only be expressed through art.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.900]   And I mean, that's the whole thing we're talking about,
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:27.740]   religion and myth.
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.380]   There's some things that are limited cognitive capabilities
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.220]   and the tools of mathematics or the tools of physics
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.380]   are just not going to allow us to capture.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.280]   Like, it's possible consciousness is one of those things.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.620]   - Yes, that is definitely possible.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.420]   But I would even say, look, I mean,
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.460]   consciousness is a thing about which we're still in the dark
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.420]   as to whether there's an explanation
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:53.620]   we would understand as an explanation at all.
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.420]   By the way, okay, I gotta give yet one more
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:56.780]   amazing Poincaré quote, 'cause this guy
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:59.080]   has never stopped coming up with great quotes.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.820]   Paul Erdős, another fellow who appears in the book,
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:05.500]   and by the way, he thinks about this notion of distance
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.540]   of personal affinity, kind of like what you're talking about,
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.260]   that kind of social network and that notion of distance
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.260]   that comes from that, so that's something that Paul Erdős--
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.340]   - Erdős did?
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.020]   - Well, he thought about distances and networks.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.780]   I guess he didn't think about the social network--
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:18.620]   - Oh, that's fascinating.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.060]   That's how it started, that story of Erdős number.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.820]   Yeah, okay, sorry to distract.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:25.100]   - But Erdős was sort of famous for saying,
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.820]   and this is sort of along the lines of what we were saying,
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:31.340]   he talked about the book, capital T, capital B, the book,
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:33.420]   and that's the book where God keeps the right proof
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:36.340]   of every theorem, so when he saw a proof he really liked,
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.980]   it was really elegant, really simple,
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:39.820]   like that's from the book, that's like you found
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.000]   one of the ones that's in the book.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.700]   He wasn't a religious guy, by the way.
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.020]   He referred to God as the supreme fascist.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:49.720]   But somehow he was like, I don't really believe in God,
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.060]   but I believe in God's book.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:54.980]   But Poincaré, on the other hand,
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.020]   and by the way, there are other,
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.700]   Hilda Hudson is one who comes up in this book.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:00.800]   She also kind of saw math.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:03.940]   She's one of the people who sort of develops
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:06.900]   the disease model that we now use,
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.380]   that we use to sort of track pandemics,
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.380]   this SIR model that sort of originally comes
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.940]   from her work with Ronald Ross.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:14.500]   But she was also super, super, super devout,
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.380]   and she also, sort of on the other side
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:18.580]   of the religious coin, was like, yeah,
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.700]   math is how we communicate with God.
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.560]   She has a great, all these people are incredibly quotable.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.700]   She says, you know, math is,
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:26.620]   the truth, the things about mathematics,
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.460]   she's like, they're not the most important of God thoughts,
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.660]   but they're the only ones that we can know precisely.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.020]   So she's like, this is the one place
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.460]   where we get to sort of see what God's thinking
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.340]   when we do mathematics.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.140]   - Again, not a fan of poetry or music.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.020]   Some people say Hendrix is like,
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:44.300]   some people say chapter one of that book is mathematics,
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.840]   and then chapter two is like classic rock.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:51.340]   Right, so like, it's not clear that the--
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.720]   I'm sorry, you just sent me off on a tangent,
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.040]   just imagining like Erdős at a Hendrix concert,
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.460]   trying to figure out if it was from the book or not.
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.960]   What I was coming to was just to say,
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.320]   but what Poincaré said about this is he's like,
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:08.440]   if this has all worked out in the language of the divine,
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:12.440]   and if a divine being came down and told it to us,
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.000]   we wouldn't be able to understand it, so it doesn't matter.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.360]   So Poincaré was of the view that there were things
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.320]   that were sort of inhumanly complex,
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.000]   and that was how they really were.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.740]   Our job is to figure out the things that are not like that.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.560]   - That are not like that.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.460]   All this talk of primes got me hungry for primes.
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:32.520]   You wrote a blog post, "The Beauty of Bounding Gaps,"
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.240]   a huge discovery about prime numbers
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.280]   and what it means for the future of math.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.780]   Can you tell me about prime numbers?
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.820]   What the heck are those?
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:42.780]   What are twin primes?
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.700]   What are prime gaps?
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.720]   What are bounding gaps in primes?
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.780]   What are all these things?
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:49.780]   And what, if anything,
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:52.100]   or what exactly is beautiful about them?
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:57.100]   - Yeah, so prime numbers are one of the things
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:01.180]   that number theorists study the most and have for millennia.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:06.220]   They are numbers which can't be factored.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.140]   And then you say, like, five.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.780]   And then you're like, wait, I can factor five.
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:11.820]   Five is five times one.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.500]   Okay, not like that.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.540]   That is a factorization.
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.700]   It absolutely is a way of expressing five
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.380]   as a product of two things.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:19.540]   But don't you agree that there's
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.900]   something trivial about it?
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.300]   It's something you could do to any number.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.340]   It doesn't have content the way that if I say
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:27.640]   that 12 is six times two or 35 is seven times five,
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.960]   I've really done something to it.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:29.800]   I've broken up.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.740]   So those are the kind of factorizations that count.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:34.460]   And a number that doesn't have a factorization like that
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:38.100]   is called prime, except, historical side note,
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:42.440]   one, which at some times in mathematical history
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.020]   has been deemed to be a prime, but currently is not.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.140]   And I think that's for the best.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.020]   But I bring it up only because sometimes people think
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.220]   that these definitions are kind of,
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.540]   if we think about them hard enough,
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.700]   we can figure out which definition is true.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.820]   - No, there's just an artifact of mathematics.
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.060]   - Yeah, we do.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:00.900]   - So it's--
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.460]   - It's a question of which definition is best for us,
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:04.300]   for our purposes.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.020]   - Well, those edge cases are weird, right?
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:11.020]   So it can't be, it doesn't count when you use yourself
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:15.020]   as a number or one as part of the factorization,
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.300]   or as the entirety of the factorization.
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:22.900]   So you somehow get to the meat of the number
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.180]   by factorizing it.
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:27.420]   And that seems to get to the core of all of mathematics.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.920]   - Yeah, you take any number and you factorize it
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.420]   until you can factorize no more.
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:33.900]   And what you have left is some big pile of primes.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.380]   I mean, by definition, when you can't factor anymore,
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:39.020]   when you're done, when you can't break the numbers up
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:40.900]   anymore, what's left must be prime.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.460]   You know, 12 breaks into two and two and three.
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.860]   So these numbers are the atoms,
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:49.380]   the building blocks of all numbers.
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:52.180]   And there's a lot we know about them,
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:53.420]   but there's much more that we don't know them.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.340]   I'll tell you the first few.
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:58.160]   There's two, three, five, seven, 11.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.780]   By the way, they're all gonna be odd from then on,
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.060]   because if they were even, I could factor two out of them.
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.300]   But it's not all the odd numbers.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.460]   Nine isn't prime, 'cause it's three times three.
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.860]   15 isn't prime, 'cause it's three times five, but 13 is.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:09.700]   Where were we?
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:13.820]   Two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17, 19.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.900]   Not 21, but 23 is, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.060]   Okay, so you could go on.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.580]   - How high could you go if we were just sitting here?
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:20.980]   By the way, your own brain.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:23.940]   Continuous, without interruption.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.940]   Would you be able to go over 100?
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.080]   - I think so.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.060]   There's always those ones that trip people up.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.740]   There's a famous one, the Grotendieck prime, 57.
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.340]   Like sort of Alexander Grotendieck,
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.700]   the great algebraic geometer, was sort of giving
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:38.660]   some lecture involving a choice of a prime in general,
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.460]   and somebody said, like, can't you just choose a prime?
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.500]   And he said, okay, 57, which is in fact not prime.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.780]   It's three times 19.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.620]   - Oh, damn.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.260]   - But it was like, I promise you in some circles
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:50.500]   it's a funny story, okay.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:55.780]   - There's a humor in it.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:59.220]   - Yes, I would say over 100 I definitely don't remember.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.420]   Like 107, I think.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.260]   I'm not sure.
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:08.500]   - So is there a category of fake primes
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.900]   that are easily mistaken to be prime?
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.700]   Like 57, I wonder.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:19.700]   - Yeah, so I would say 57 and 51
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.860]   are definitely like prime offenders.
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:23.020]   Oh, I didn't do that on purpose.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.300]   - Oh, well done.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:25.340]   - Didn't do it on purpose.
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:28.180]   Anyway, there are definitely ones that people,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.660]   or 91 is another classic, seven times 13.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.900]   It really feels kind of prime, doesn't it?
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:33.740]   But it is not.
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:36.900]   But there's also, by the way,
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.580]   but there's also an actual notion of pseudo prime,
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.460]   which is a thing with a formal definition,
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:43.380]   which is not a psychological thing.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:47.540]   It is a prime which passes a primality test
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.380]   devised by Fermat, which is a very good test,
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.540]   which if a number fails this test,
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.580]   it's definitely not prime.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:55.620]   And so there was some hope that,
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.300]   oh, maybe if a number passes the test,
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.420]   then it definitely is prime.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:00.660]   That would give a very simple criterion for primality.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.980]   Unfortunately, it's only perfect in one direction.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:08.980]   So there are numbers, I wanna say 341 is the smallest,
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.380]   which pass the test, but are not prime, 341.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.740]   - Is this test easily explainable or no?
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.820]   - Yes, actually.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.260]   Ready, let me give you the simplest version of it.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:19.340]   You can dress it up a little bit,
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.640]   but here's the basic idea.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.140]   I take the number, the mystery number.
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.300]   I raise two to that power.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:32.620]   So let's say your mystery number is six.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.860]   Are you sorry you asked me?
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:34.700]   Are you ready to throw it?
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.100]   - No, you're breaking my brain again, but yes.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.180]   - Let's do it.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:40.020]   We're gonna do a live demonstration.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:43.300]   Let's say your number is six.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:45.940]   So I'm gonna raise two to the sixth power.
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.260]   Okay, so if I were working, I'd be like,
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.740]   that's two cubed squared, so that's eight times eight.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.620]   So that's 64.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.480]   Now we're gonna divide by six,
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.940]   but I don't actually care what the quotient is,
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.060]   only the remainder.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:01.380]   So let's see, 64 divided by six is,
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:04.480]   well, there's a quotient of 10, but the remainder is four.
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.620]   So you failed because the answer has to be two.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:13.220]   For any prime, let's do it with five, which is prime.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:15.540]   Two to the fifth is 32.
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.260]   Divide 32 by five, and you get six
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:21.460]   with a remainder of two.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:24.220]   - With a remainder of two, yeah.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.700]   - For seven, two to the seventh is 128.
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:29.440]   Divide that by seven, and let's see.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.580]   I think that's seven times 14.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.420]   Is that right?
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.240]   No.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:39.700]   Seven times 18 is 126, with a remainder of two, right?
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:43.340]   128 is a multiple of seven plus two.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.480]   So if that remainder is not two--
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.320]   - Then that's definitely not prime.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.460]   - Then it's definitely not prime.
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:53.300]   - And then if it is, it's likely a prime, but not for sure.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:54.620]   - It's likely a prime, but not for sure.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.220]   And there's actually a beautiful geometric proof,
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.200]   which is in the book, actually.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.700]   That's one of the most granular parts of the book,
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.420]   'cause it's such a beautiful proof, I could not give it.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:05.380]   So you draw a lot of opal and pearl necklaces,
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.220]   and spin them.
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:07.420]   That's kind of the geometric nature
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:09.980]   of this proof of Fermat's little theorem.
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:13.620]   So yeah, so with pseudoprimes,
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.740]   there are primes that are kind of faking it.
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.540]   They pass that test, but there are numbers
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:17.940]   that are faking it that pass that test,
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.300]   but are not actually prime.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.820]   But the point is,
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:28.860]   there are many, many, many theorems about prime numbers.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.140]   - Are there, like there's a bunch of questions to ask.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:34.700]   Is there an infinite number of primes?
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:37.500]   Can we say something about the gap between primes
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:41.020]   as the numbers grow larger and larger and larger and so on?
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.220]   - Yeah, it's a perfect example of your desire
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.660]   for simplicity in all things.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.300]   You know what would be really simple?
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.820]   If there was only finitely many primes,
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:51.560]   and then there would be this finite set of atoms
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.880]   that all numbers would be built up on.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.900]   That would be very simple and good in certain ways,
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:58.900]   but it's completely false.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.220]   And number theory would be totally different
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.040]   if that were the case.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:01.880]   It's just not true.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.700]   In fact, this is something else that Euclid knew.
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.540]   So this is a very, very old fact,
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:10.340]   like much before, long before we had anything
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.180]   like modern number theory.
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.140]   - The primes are infinite.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.020]   - The primes that there are, right, the infinite primes.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:15.460]   - There's an infinite number of primes.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.740]   So what about the gaps between the primes?
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:20.460]   - Right, so one thing that people recognized
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.220]   and really thought about a lot is that the primes,
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.840]   on average, seem to get farther and farther apart
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.020]   as they get bigger and bigger.
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.100]   In other words, it's less and less common.
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.100]   Like I already told you of the first 10 numbers,
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:32.900]   two, three, five, seven, four of them are prime.
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:34.660]   That's a lot, 40%.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:38.500]   If I looked at 10-digit numbers,
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.580]   no way would 40% of those be prime.
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.980]   Being prime would be a lot rarer,
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.900]   in some sense because there's a lot more things
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.820]   for them to be divisible by.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.100]   That's one way of thinking of it.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.380]   It's a lot more possible for there to be a factorization
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:50.340]   because there's a lot of things
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:52.100]   you can try to factor out of it.
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:53.380]   As the numbers get bigger and bigger,
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:55.220]   primality gets rarer and rarer.
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:00.260]   The extent to which that's the case,
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:01.700]   that's pretty well understood.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:03.980]   But then you can ask more fine-grained questions.
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:04.860]   Here is one.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:11.740]   A twin prime is a pair of primes that are two apart,
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:14.940]   like three and five, or like 11 and 13,
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.340]   or like 17 and 19.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.160]   One thing we still don't know is
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.960]   are there infinitely many of those?
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.100]   We know on average they get farther and farther apart,
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:26.500]   but that doesn't mean there couldn't be occasional
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:30.180]   folks that come close together.
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:32.940]   And indeed, we think that there are.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:35.220]   And one interesting question,
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:39.420]   'cause I think you might say,
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:41.020]   how could one possibly have a right
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:44.020]   to have an opinion about something like that?
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.660]   We don't have any way of describing
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:48.420]   a process that makes primes.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:52.300]   Sure, you can look at your computer and see a lot of them,
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.860]   but the fact that there's a lot,
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.900]   why is that evidence that there's infinitely many?
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:57.620]   Maybe I can go on my computer and find 10 million.
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:59.900]   Well, 10 million is pretty far from infinity,
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.580]   so how is that evidence?
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:02.480]   There's a lot of things.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.140]   There's a lot more than 10 million atoms.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.460]   That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.300]   in the universe.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:07.700]   I mean, on most people's physical theories,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.140]   there's probably not, as I understand it.
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:13.180]   Okay, so why would we think this?
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:16.660]   The answer is that it turns out to be
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.700]   incredibly productive and enlightening
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:23.260]   to think about primes as if they were random numbers,
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.940]   as if they were randomly distributed
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.100]   according to a certain law.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.060]   Now, they're not.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:27.900]   They're not random.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:28.900]   There's no chance involved.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.180]   It's completely deterministic
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.660]   whether a number is prime or not,
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:35.460]   and yet it just turns out to be phenomenally useful
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:38.140]   in mathematics to say,
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:41.780]   even if something is governed by a deterministic law,
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.140]   let's just pretend it wasn't.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.480]   Let's just pretend that they were produced
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.600]   by some random process and see if the behavior
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.980]   is roughly the same,
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.660]   and if it's not, maybe change the random process.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.100]   Maybe make the randomness a little bit different
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.820]   and tweak it and see if you can find a random process
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:55.380]   that matches the behavior we see,
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:58.460]   and then maybe you predict that other behaviors
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:02.900]   of the system are like that of the random process.
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:04.060]   And so that's kind of like, it's funny,
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:05.260]   because I think when you talk to people
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.420]   about the twin prime conjecture,
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.940]   people think you're saying,
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:12.400]   wow, there's like some deep structure there
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:15.180]   that like makes those primes be like close together
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.540]   again and again, and no,
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:18.260]   it's the opposite of deep structure.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:19.780]   What we say when we say we believe
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:21.500]   the twin prime conjecture is that we believe
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.540]   the primes are like sort of strewn around pretty randomly,
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.660]   and if they were, then by chance you would expect
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.180]   there to be infinitely many twin primes,
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.620]   and we're saying, yeah, we expect them to behave
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:32.500]   just like they would if they were random dirt.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.860]   - You know, the fascinating parallel here
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:38.380]   is I just got a chance to talk to Sam Harris,
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:42.220]   and he uses the prime numbers as an example often.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:45.460]   I don't know if you're familiar with who Sam is.
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:49.280]   He uses that as an example of there being no free will.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.360]   Wait, where does he get this?
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.680]   - Well, he just uses as an example of it might seem
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.440]   like this is a random number generator,
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.760]   but it's all like formally defined.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.080]   So if we keep getting more and more primes,
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:09.160]   then like that might feel like a new discovery,
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:12.120]   and that might feel like a new experience, but it's not.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.320]   It was always written in the cards.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.680]   But it's funny that you say that
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:18.280]   because a lot of people think of like randomness.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.440]   The fundamental randomness within the nature of reality
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.960]   might be the source of something
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.840]   that we experience as free will.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.240]   And you're saying it's like useful to look at prime numbers
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.240]   as a random process in order to prove stuff about them,
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.860]   but fundamentally, of course, it's not a random process.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:40.960]   - Well, not in order to prove stuff about them
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.780]   so much as to figure out what we expect to be true
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.620]   and then try to prove that.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:45.960]   'Cause here's what you don't wanna do,
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.380]   try really hard to prove something that's false.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:51.120]   That makes it really hard to prove the thing if it's false.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.040]   So you certainly wanna have some heuristic ways
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.160]   of guessing, making good guesses about what's true.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.720]   So yeah, here's what I would say.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:58.720]   You're gonna be imaginary Sam Harris now.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.000]   You are talking about prime numbers,
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:01.840]   and you are like,
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.040]   "But prime numbers are completely deterministic."
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:04.880]   And I'm saying like,
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.000]   "Well, but let's treat them like a random process."
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.200]   And then you say,
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.560]   "But you're just saying something that's not true.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.960]   "They're not a random process, they're deterministic."
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.080]   And I'm like, "Okay, great, you hold to your insistence
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:13.920]   "that it's not a random process.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.820]   "Meanwhile, I'm generating insight about the primes
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:17.700]   "that you're not because I'm willing to sort of pretend
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:18.600]   "that there's something that they're not
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.460]   "in order to understand what's going on."
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.960]   - Yeah, so it doesn't matter what the reality is.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.960]   What matters is what framework of thought
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:30.800]   results in the maximum number of insights.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.440]   - Yeah, 'cause I feel, look, I'm sorry,
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.220]   but I feel like you have more insights about people
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.360]   if you think of them as like beings
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.120]   that have wants and needs and desires
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.920]   and do stuff on purpose.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.860]   Even if that's not true,
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.540]   you still understand better what's going on
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:44.640]   by treating them in that way.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.520]   Don't you find, look, when you work on machine learning,
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.540]   don't you find yourself sort of talking about
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:52.800]   what the machine is trying to do in a certain instance?
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.960]   Do you not find yourself drawn to that language?
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.480]   - Well, I-- - Oh, it knows this,
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.000]   it's trying to do that, it's learning that.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.960]   - I'm certainly drawn to that language
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.400]   to the point where I receive quite a bit of criticisms
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.400]   for it 'cause I, you know, like--
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.040]   - Oh, I'm on your side, man.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.720]   - So especially in robotics, I don't know why,
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.260]   but robotics people don't like to name their robots.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:17.000]   Or they certainly don't like to gender their robots
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.760]   because the moment you gender a robot,
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.600]   you start to anthropomorphize.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.440]   If you say he or she, you start to,
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.800]   in your mind, construct like a life story in your mind.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.040]   You can't help it.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.520]   There's like, you create like a humorous story
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.600]   to this person, you start to, this person, this robot,
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.320]   you start to project your own,
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.800]   but I think that's what we do to each other.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.480]   I think that's actually really useful
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:42.640]   for the engineering process,
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.580]   especially for human-robot interaction,
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.620]   and yes, for machine learning systems,
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.020]   for helping you build an intuition
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.900]   about a particular problem.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.920]   It's almost like asking this question,
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.940]   you know, when a machine learning system fails
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.860]   in a particular edge case, asking like,
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:59.820]   "What were you thinking about?"
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.980]   Like, asking like almost like when you're talking about
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:06.620]   to a child who just did something bad,
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:09.400]   you wanna understand like, what was,
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.060]   how did they see the world?
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.040]   Maybe there's a totally new,
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.520]   maybe you're the one that's thinking
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.840]   about the world incorrectly.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.880]   And yeah, that anthropomorphization process,
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.400]   I think is ultimately good for insight,
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.640]   and the same as I agree with you,
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.680]   I tend to believe about free will as well.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.900]   Let me ask you a ridiculous question, if it's okay.
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:30.240]   - Of course.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.400]   - I've just recently, most people go on like rabbit hole,
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:37.360]   like YouTube things, and I went on a rabbit hole
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.800]   often do of Wikipedia,
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.800]   and I found a page on finitism,
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.080]   ultra finitism and intuitionism,
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.160]   or I forget what it's called.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.120]   - Yeah, intuitionism.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.740]   - Intuitionism.
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:55.600]   That seemed pretty interesting.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.420]   I have it on my to-do list to actually like look into,
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:00.800]   like, is there people who like formally,
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.600]   like real mathematicians are trying to argue for this.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:07.480]   But the belief there, I think, let's say finitism,
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:10.160]   that infinity is fake.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.880]   Meaning infinity may be like a useful hack for certain,
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.900]   like a useful tool in mathematics,
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:22.500]   but it really gets us into trouble,
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:26.680]   because there's no infinity in the real world.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.020]   Maybe I'm sort of not expressing that fully correctly,
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:33.420]   but basically saying like there's things there,
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.080]   once you add into mathematics,
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.080]   things that are not provably within the physical world,
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.840]   you're starting to inject, to corrupt your framework
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:46.680]   of reason.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.240]   What do you think about that?
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.560]   - I mean, I think, okay, so first of all,
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.040]   I'm not an expert, and I couldn't even tell you
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.960]   what the difference is between those three terms,
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.000]   finitism, ultra finitism, and intuitionism.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000]   Although I know they're related,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.680]   I tend to associate them with the Netherlands in the 1930s.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.920]   - Okay, I'll tell you, can I just quickly comment,
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.880]   because I read the Wikipedia page?
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.920]   The difference in ultra-
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.520]   - That's like the ultimate sentence of the modern age.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.680]   Can I just comment, because I read the Wikipedia page.
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.680]   That sums up our moment.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.520]   - Bro, I'm basically an expert.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:22.600]   Ultra finitism, so finitism says that the only infinity
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.240]   you're allowed to have is that the natural numbers
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.160]   are infinite.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.280]   So like those numbers are infinite.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:32.240]   So like one, two, three, four, five,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.300]   the integers are infinite.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.600]   The ultra finitism says, nope, even that infinity is fake.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.520]   That's-
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.160]   - I'll bet ultra finitism came second.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.800]   I'll bet it's like when there's like a hardcore scene,
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.240]   and then one guy's like, oh, now there's a lot of people
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.200]   in this scene, I have to find a way to be more hardcore
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.240]   than the hardcore people.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.480]   - It's all back to the emo talk, yeah.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.800]   Okay, so is there any, are you ever,
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.080]   'cause I'm often uncomfortable with infinity,
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.440]   like psychologically.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.600]   I have trouble when that sneaks in there.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.640]   It's 'cause it works so damn well,
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.360]   I get a little suspicious,
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.560]   because it could be almost like a crutch
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.520]   or an oversimplification that's missing something profound
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.440]   about reality.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:20.720]   - Well, so first of all, okay, if you say like,
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.920]   is there like a serious way of doing mathematics
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:29.300]   that doesn't really treat infinity as a real thing,
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.880]   or maybe it's kind of agnostic, and it's like,
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.620]   I'm not really gonna make a firm statement
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:33.920]   about whether it's a real thing or not.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.360]   Yeah, that's called most of the history of mathematics.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.360]   Right, so it's only after Cantor, right,
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:43.120]   that we really are sort of, okay, we're gonna like,
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.600]   have a notion of like the cardinality of an infinite set
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:49.040]   and like do something that you might call
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.280]   like the modern theory of infinity.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.040]   That said, obviously, everybody was drawn to this notion,
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.720]   and no, not everybody was comfortable with it.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.640]   Look, I mean, this is what happens with Newton, right?
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:01.320]   I mean, so Newton understands that to talk about tangents
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:03.440]   and to talk about instantaneous velocity,
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:06.560]   he has to do something that we would now call
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:08.660]   taking a limit, right?
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.220]   The fabled dy over dx, if you sort of go back
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.080]   to your calculus class, for those who've taken calculus,
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:14.800]   remember this mysterious thing.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.320]   And you know, what is it?
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.160]   What is it?
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.360]   Well, he'd say like, well, it's like you sort of
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:24.040]   divide the length of this line segment
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.240]   by the length of this other line segment,
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.280]   and then you make them a little shorter,
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:27.520]   and you divide again, and then you make them
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:28.740]   a little shorter, and you divide again,
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:29.720]   and then you just keep on doing that
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.760]   until they're like infinitely short,
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.520]   and then you divide them again.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.360]   These quantities that are like, they're not zero,
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:41.360]   but they're also smaller than any actual number,
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.440]   these infinitesimals.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.360]   Well, people were queasy about it,
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.200]   and they weren't wrong to be queasy about it, right?
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:50.080]   From a modern perspective, it was not really well formed.
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.280]   There's this very famous critique of Newton
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.480]   by Bishop Berkeley, where he says like,
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:57.840]   what, these things you define, like, you know,
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.280]   they're not zero, but they're smaller than any number.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:02.360]   Are they the ghosts of departed quantities?
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.600]   (laughing)
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.840]   That was this like, ultra-par.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.680]   - That's a good line.
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:06.840]   - Of Newton.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.040]   And on the one hand, he was right.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.720]   It wasn't really rigorous by modern standards.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.960]   On the other hand, like, Newton was out there
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.360]   doing calculus, and other people were not, right?
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.400]   - It works, it works.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:20.640]   - I think a sort of intuitionist view, for instance,
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:23.640]   I would say would express serious doubt.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.920]   And it's not just infinity.
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:28.080]   It's like saying, I think we would express serious doubt
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.320]   that like, the real numbers exist.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:36.280]   Now, most people are comfortable with the real numbers.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.160]   - Well, computer scientists with floating point number,
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:42.680]   I mean, floating point arithmetic.
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.680]   - That's a great point, actually.
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:48.360]   I think, in some sense, this flavor of doing math,
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:51.200]   saying we shouldn't talk about things
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.600]   that we cannot specify in a finite amount of time,
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.960]   there's something very computational in flavor about that.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.560]   And it's probably not a coincidence
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.720]   that it becomes popular in the '30s and '40s,
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:04.960]   which is also kind of like the dawn of ideas
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.160]   about formal computation, right?
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.920]   You probably know the timeline better than I do.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:09.600]   - Sorry, what becomes popular?
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.160]   - These ideas that maybe we should be doing math
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.120]   in this more restrictive way, where even a thing that,
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.520]   because look, the origin of all this is like,
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.640]   a number represents a magnitude, like the length of a line.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:26.080]   So, I mean, the idea that there's a continuum,
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.600]   there's sort of like, is pretty old,
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:31.920]   but just 'cause the thing is old
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:34.200]   doesn't mean we can't reject it if we want to.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.600]   - Well, a lot of the fundamental ideas in computer science,
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:40.060]   when you talk about the complexity of problems,
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:45.080]   to Turing himself, they rely on infinity as well.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.600]   The ideas that kind of challenge that,
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.800]   the whole space of machine learning,
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:51.000]   I would say, challenges that.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.020]   It's almost like the engineering approach to things,
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.640]   like the floating point arithmetic.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:57.360]   The other one that, back to John Conway,
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.160]   that challenges this idea, I mean,
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:04.280]   maybe to tie in the ideas of deformation theory
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.280]   and limits to infinity, is this idea of cellular automata.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:17.360]   With John Conway looking at "The Game of Life,"
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:20.840]   Stephen Wolfram's work, that I've been a big fan of
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.560]   for a while, of cellular automata.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.880]   I was wondering if you have ever encountered
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.920]   these kinds of objects,
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.320]   you ever looked at them as a mathematician,
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:34.320]   where you have very simple rules of tiny little objects,
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.000]   that when taken as a whole, create incredible complexities,
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.800]   but are very difficult to analyze,
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:41.960]   very difficult to make sense of,
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.120]   even though the one individual object, one part,
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.960]   it's like what we were saying about Andrew Wiles,
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:49.800]   like you can look at the deformation of a small piece
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.360]   to tell you about the whole.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.440]   It feels like with cellular automata,
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.400]   or any kind of complex systems,
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.800]   it's often very difficult to say something
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:01.640]   about the whole thing,
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.120]   even when you can precisely describe the operation
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.400]   of the local neighborhoods.
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.960]   - Yeah, I mean, I love that subject.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:12.640]   I haven't really done research in it myself.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.520]   I've played around with it.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.040]   I'll send you a fun blog post I wrote,
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.360]   where I made some cool texture patterns
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:20.080]   from cellular automata that I, but--
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.480]   - And those are really always compelling,
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:24.120]   is like you create simple rules,
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.800]   and they create some beautiful textures.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:26.640]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:28.000]   - Actually, did you see there was a great paper,
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000]   I don't know if you saw this,
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.640]   like a machine learning paper.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.480]   - Yes, yes.
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:32.320]   - I don't know if you saw the one I'm talking about,
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.400]   where they were learning the textures,
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.640]   like let's try to reverse engineer,
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.200]   and learn a cellular automaton that can produce texture
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.320]   that looks like this, from the images.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:43.800]   Very cool, and as you say, the thing you said is,
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.040]   I feel the same way when I read machine learning papers,
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.640]   that what's especially interesting
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.520]   is the cases where it doesn't work.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.920]   Like what does it do when it doesn't do
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.360]   the thing that you tried to train it to do?
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.480]   That's extremely interesting.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.120]   Yeah, yeah, that was a cool paper.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:58.360]   So yeah, so let's start with the game of life.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.320]   Let's start with, or let's start with John Conway.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.080]   So Conway, so yeah, so let's start with John Conway again.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.620]   Just, I don't know, from my outsider's perspective,
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:11.520]   there's not many mathematicians that stand out
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.800]   throughout the history of the 20th century.
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:15.080]   He's one of them.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:18.200]   I feel like he's not sufficiently recognized.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.120]   - I think he's pretty recognized.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.080]   - Okay, well.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:24.320]   - I mean, he was a full professor at Princeton
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:25.160]   for most of his life.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.040]   He was sort of in, certainly at the pinnacle of.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.120]   - Yeah, but I found myself, every time I talk about Conway
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:32.180]   and how excited I am about him,
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:36.620]   I have to constantly explain to people who he is.
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:39.520]   And that's always a sad sign to me.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.480]   But that's probably true for a lot of mathematicians.
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.160]   - I was about to say, I feel like you have
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.920]   a very elevated idea of how famous,
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:46.680]   this is what happens when you grow up in the Soviet Union,
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.840]   or you think the mathematicians are very, very famous.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:51.800]   - Yeah, but I'm not actually so convinced
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.600]   at a tiny tangent that that shouldn't be so.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:57.600]   I mean, there's, it's not obvious to me
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:00.600]   that that's one of the, like, if I were to analyze
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:04.080]   American society, that perhaps elevating mathematical
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.000]   and scientific thinking to a little bit higher level
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.700]   would benefit the society.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.260]   Well, both in discovering the beauty of what it is
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:14.960]   to be human and for actually creating cool technology,
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.200]   better iPhones.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.120]   But anyway, John Conway.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:20.000]   - Yeah, and Conway is such a perfect example
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.040]   of somebody whose humanity was, and his personality
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.040]   was like wound up with his mathematics, right?
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:26.760]   It's what's not, sometimes I think people
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:28.640]   who are outside the field think of mathematics
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:31.220]   as this kind of like cold thing that you do
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.080]   separate from your existence as a human being.
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.760]   No way, your personality is in there,
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.120]   just as it would be in like a novel you wrote
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.080]   or a painting you painted, or just like the way
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:40.080]   you walk down the street.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.760]   Like, it's in there, it's you doing it.
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.560]   And Conway was certainly a singular personality.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:50.960]   I think anybody would say that he was playful,
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:54.240]   like everything was a game to him.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:56.600]   Now, what you might think I'm gonna say,
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.280]   and it's true, is that he sort of was very playful
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.800]   in his way of doing mathematics.
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:03.700]   But it's also true, it went both ways.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:06.240]   He also sort of made mathematics out of games.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.880]   He like looked at, he was a constant inventor of games
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:11.240]   with like crazy names, and then he would sort of
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.120]   analyze those games mathematically.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.240]   To the point that he, and then later collaborating
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.680]   with Knuth, like, you know, created this number system,
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:23.720]   the serial numbers, in which actually each number
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:25.200]   is a game.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:26.640]   There's a wonderful book about this called,
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:27.920]   I mean, there are his own books, and then there's
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.760]   like a book that he wrote with Burle Camp and Guy
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:34.760]   called Winning Ways, which is such a rich source of ideas.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:41.740]   And he too kind of has his own crazy number system,
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.240]   in which, by the way, there are these infinitesimals,
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.680]   the ghosts of departed quantities, they're in there.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:48.840]   Now, not as ghosts, but as like certain kind
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.020]   of two-player games.
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:57.960]   So, you know, he was a guy, so I knew him when I was
[01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:01.280]   a post-doc, and I knew him at Princeton,
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.620]   and our research overlapped in some ways.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:05.480]   Now, it was on stuff that he had worked on many years
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:07.400]   before, the stuff I was working on kind of connected
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.560]   with stuff in group theory, which somehow seems
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:10.440]   to keep coming up.
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.000]   And so I often would like sort of ask him a question,
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.660]   I would sort of come upon him in the common room,
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.080]   and I would ask him a question about something.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:23.760]   And just, anytime you turned him on, you know what I mean?
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.860]   You sort of asked a question, it was just like turning
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.160]   a knob and winding him up, and he would just go,
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.720]   and you would get a response that was like,
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.360]   so rich and went so many places, and taught you so much.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.360]   And usually had nothing to do with your question.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.200]   - Yeah.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:43.060]   - Usually your question was just a prompt to him.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.560]   You couldn't count on actually getting the question
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:45.400]   answered.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.400]   - He had those brilliant, curious minds, even at that age.
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.360]   Yeah, it was definitely a huge loss.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:55.800]   But on his Game of Life, which was, I think he developed
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:58.800]   in the '70s, as almost like a side thing,
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.640]   a fun little experiment.
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:01.400]   - Yeah, the Game of Life is this,
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:05.160]   it's a very simple algorithm.
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:08.600]   It's not really a game, per se, in the sense of the kinds
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:10.400]   of games that he liked, where people played against
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.400]   each other, but essentially it's a game that you play
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:20.380]   with marking little squares on a sheet of graph paper.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.340]   And in the '70s, I think he was literally doing it
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:24.220]   with a pen on graph paper.
[02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:26.660]   You have some configuration of squares, some of the squares
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.900]   on the graph paper are filled in, some are not.
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:32.340]   And then there's a rule, a single rule, that tells you
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:36.460]   at the next stage, which squares are filled in,
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:38.100]   and which squares are not.
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:39.740]   Sometimes an empty square gets filled in,
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:40.580]   that's called birth.
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:43.020]   Sometimes a square that's filled in gets erased,
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:43.940]   that's called death.
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.860]   And there's rules for which squares are born
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.100]   and which squares die.
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:53.660]   The rule is very simple, you can write it on one line.
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:56.220]   And then the great miracle is that you can start
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:00.580]   from some very innocent-looking little small set of boxes
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:04.180]   and get these results of incredible richness.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.700]   And of course, nowadays you don't do it on paper.
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:07.020]   Nowadays you do it on a computer.
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:09.340]   There's actually a great iPad app called Golly,
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:12.820]   which I really like, that has Conway's original rule
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:15.600]   and gosh, hundreds of other variants.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:17.580]   And it's lightning fast, so you can just be like,
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:21.620]   I wanna see 10,000 generations of this rule play out
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:23.020]   faster than your eye can even follow.
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:25.140]   And it's amazing, so I highly recommend it
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:26.380]   if this is at all intriguing to you,
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:29.460]   getting Golly on your iOS device.
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:30.780]   - And you can do this kind of process,
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:33.660]   which I really enjoy doing, which is almost
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:37.220]   like putting a Darwin hat on or a biologist hat on
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:41.500]   and doing analysis of a higher level of abstraction,
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.540]   like the organisms that spring up.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:45.140]   'Cause there's different kinds of organisms.
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:46.880]   Like you can think of them as species
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:48.620]   and they interact with each other.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:51.020]   They can, there's gliders, they shoot,
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:54.320]   there's like things that can travel around,
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.720]   there's things that can, glider guns,
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:58.480]   that can generate those gliders.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.140]   - Exactly, right, these can--
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:02.420]   - You can use the same kind of language as you would
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:04.620]   about describing a biological system.
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:06.260]   - So it's a wonderful laboratory
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:07.940]   and it's kind of a rebuke to someone
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:10.980]   who doesn't think that very, very rich,
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:15.340]   complex structure can come from very simple
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:18.940]   underlying laws, like it definitely can.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:20.620]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:23.680]   If you just picked some random rule,
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:26.220]   you wouldn't get interesting complexity.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:28.380]   I think that's one of the most interesting things
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:31.460]   of these, one of the most interesting features
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:32.740]   of this whole subject, that the rules
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.140]   have to be tuned just right.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:36.700]   Like a sort of typical rule set doesn't generate
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:38.780]   any kind of interesting behavior.
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:43.780]   But some do, and I don't think we have a clear way
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.420]   of understanding which do and which don't.
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:47.340]   Maybe Stephen thinks he does, I don't know.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:48.860]   - No, no, it's a giant mystery.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:51.820]   What Stephen Wolfram did is,
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:55.540]   now there's a whole interesting aspect
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.620]   to the fact that he's a little bit of an outcast
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:59.900]   in the mathematics and physics community
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:02.660]   because he's so focused on a particular,
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.780]   his particular work, I think if you put ego aside,
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:09.100]   which I think, unfairly, some people are not able
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.880]   to look beyond, I think his work is actually quite brilliant.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:13.840]   But what he did is exactly this process
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:16.940]   of Darwin-like exploration, is taking these very simple
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:19.880]   ideas and writing a thousand page book on them,
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:23.500]   meaning like, let's play around with this thing, let's see.
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:25.460]   And can we figure anything out?
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.320]   Spoiler alert, no, we can't.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.940]   In fact, he does a challenge, I think it's like
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:34.140]   a rule 30 challenge, which is quite interesting,
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:36.380]   just simply for machine learning people,
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:40.460]   for mathematics people, is can you predict
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.820]   the middle column?
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.980]   For his, it's a 1D cellular automata.
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:49.940]   Can you, generally speaking, can you predict anything
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:53.100]   about how a particular rule will evolve,
[02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:54.380]   just in the future?
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:58.020]   Very simply, just looking at one particular part
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:00.540]   of the world, just zooming in on that part,
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:04.740]   you know, 100 steps ahead, can you predict something?
[02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:08.800]   And the challenge is to do that kind of prediction,
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:10.340]   so far as nobody's come up with an answer,
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:14.600]   but the point is, we can't, we don't have tools,
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.140]   or maybe it's impossible, or, I mean,
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:19.980]   he has these kind of laws of irreducibility,
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:21.500]   they hear first, but it's poetry,
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:22.880]   it's like we can't prove these things.
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:25.240]   It seems like we can't, that's the basic,
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:28.500]   it almost sounds like ancient mathematics
[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:30.060]   or something like that, where you're like,
[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:32.660]   the gods will not allow us to predict
[02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:36.460]   the cellular automata, but that's fascinating
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:39.100]   that we can't, I'm not sure what to make of it,
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:42.540]   and there's power to calling this particular set
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:45.460]   of rules game of life, as Conway did,
[02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:49.500]   because I'm not exactly sure, but I think he had a sense
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:53.220]   that there's some core ideas here that are fundamental
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:56.540]   to life, to complex systems, to the way life
[02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:57.520]   emerged on Earth.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.760]   I'm not sure I think Conway thought that.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:03.240]   It's something that, I mean, Conway always had
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:05.920]   a rather ambivalent relationship with the game of life,
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:10.920]   because I think he saw it as, it was certainly
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:14.720]   the thing he was most famous for in the outside world,
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:18.680]   and I think that he, his view, which is correct,
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.360]   is that he had done things that were much deeper
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:22.120]   mathematically than that, you know what I mean?
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:24.320]   And I think it always aggrieved him a bit
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:26.240]   that he was like the game of life guy,
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.640]   when he proved all these wonderful theorems,
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:32.120]   and created all these wonderful games,
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.620]   created the theorem of numbers.
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:37.680]   He was a very tireless guy who just did
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:40.840]   an incredibly variegated array of stuff,
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:43.640]   so he was exactly the kind of person who you would
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:45.640]   never want to reduce to one achievement,
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.920]   you know what I mean?
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.400]   - Let me ask about group theory.
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.800]   You mentioned it a few times.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.440]   What is group theory?
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:57.420]   What is an idea from group theory that you find beautiful?
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:01.960]   - Well, so I would say group theory sort of starts
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:04.480]   as the general theory of symmetry,
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:08.240]   is that people looked at different kinds of things
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:12.920]   and said, as we said, oh, it could have,
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:16.400]   maybe all there is is symmetry from left to right,
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:17.720]   like a human being, right?
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:21.040]   That's roughly bilaterally symmetric, as we say.
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:24.240]   So there's two symmetries, and then you're like,
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:25.460]   well, wait, didn't I say there's just one,
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:26.700]   there's just left to right?
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:30.100]   Well, we always count the symmetry of doing nothing.
[02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:31.860]   We always count the symmetry that's like,
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:33.100]   there's flip and don't flip.
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.220]   Those are the two configurations that you can be in.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:36.060]   So there's two.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:40.240]   You know, something like a rectangle
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:41.560]   is bilaterally symmetric.
[02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:42.600]   You can flip it left to right,
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:44.540]   but you can also flip it top to bottom.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.680]   So there's actually four symmetries.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:50.320]   There's do nothing, flip it left to right,
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:53.020]   and flip it top to bottom, or do both of those things.
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:59.700]   A square, there's even more,
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:01.700]   because now you can rotate it.
[02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:03.080]   You can rotate it by 90 degrees.
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:04.920]   So you can't do that, that's not a symmetry of the rectangle.
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:06.180]   If you try to rotate it 90 degrees,
[02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:08.880]   you get a rectangle oriented in a different way.
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:13.160]   So a person has two symmetries, a rectangle four,
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:15.420]   a square eight, different kinds of shapes
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:17.520]   have different numbers of symmetries.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.940]   And the real observation is that
[02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:21.940]   that's just not like a set of things.
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:25.060]   They can be combined.
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:27.700]   You do one symmetry, then you do another.
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:31.020]   The result of that is some third symmetry.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:34.840]   So a group really abstracts away this notion of saying,
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:41.180]   it's just some collection of transformations
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.980]   you can do to a thing where you combine
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:44.380]   any two of them to get a third.
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:45.620]   And so, you know, a place where this comes up
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:48.260]   in computer science is in sorting,
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:50.500]   because the ways of permuting a set,
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.340]   the ways of taking sort of some set of things
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:53.260]   you have on the table and putting them
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:54.260]   in a different order,
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:56.100]   shuffling a deck of cards, for instance,
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:57.580]   those are the symmetries of the deck.
[02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:58.420]   And there's a lot of them.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:00.140]   There's not two, there's not four, there's not eight.
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:01.580]   Think about how many different orders
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:02.620]   a deck of card can be in.
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:05.980]   Each one of those is the result of applying a symmetry
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.660]   to the original deck.
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.060]   So a shuffle is a symmetry, right?
[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.620]   You're reordering the cards.
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:12.940]   If I shuffle and then you shuffle,
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:16.020]   the result is some other kind of thing
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:17.780]   you might call a double shuffle,
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:19.980]   which is a more complicated symmetry.
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:22.180]   So group theory is kind of the study
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:25.980]   of the general abstract world that encompasses
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:27.020]   all these kinds of things.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:29.380]   But then of course, like lots of things
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:31.780]   that are way more complicated than that.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:33.540]   Like infinite groups of symmetries, for instance.
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:35.100]   - So they can be infinite, huh?
[02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:35.940]   - Oh yeah.
[02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:36.780]   - Okay.
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:37.620]   - Well, okay, ready?
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:41.180]   Think about the symmetries of the line.
[02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:45.020]   You're like, okay, I can reflect it left to right,
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:46.820]   you know, around the origin.
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.580]   Okay, but I could also reflect it left to right,
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:52.180]   grabbing somewhere else, like at one or two
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.620]   or pi or anywhere.
[02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.420]   Or I could just slide it some distance.
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:57.340]   That's a symmetry.
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:58.540]   Slide it five units over.
[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:01.220]   So there's clearly infinitely many symmetries of the line.
[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:03.500]   That's an example of an infinite group of symmetries.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:06.940]   - Is it possible to say something that kind of captivates,
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:09.420]   keeps being brought up by physicists,
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:11.740]   which is gauge theory, gauge symmetry,
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:14.900]   as one of the more complicated type of symmetries?
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:18.380]   Is there an easy explanation of what the heck it is?
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.860]   Is that something that comes up on your mind at all?
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.340]   - Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:24.380]   but I can say this.
[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:29.380]   It is certainly true that it has been a very useful notion
[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:31.860]   in physics to try to say, like,
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.580]   what are the symmetry groups of the world?
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:35.660]   Like, what are the symmetries
[02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:36.980]   under which things don't change, right?
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:39.220]   So we just, I think we talked a little bit earlier
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:40.700]   about it should be a basic principle
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:44.180]   that a theorem that's true here is also true over there.
[02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:45.660]   And same for a physical law, right?
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:47.660]   I mean, if gravity is like this over here,
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:49.140]   it should also be like this over there.
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:52.620]   Okay, what that's saying is we think translation in space
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:53.980]   should be a symmetry.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:56.500]   All the laws of physics should be unchanged
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:57.820]   if the symmetry we have in mind
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:59.660]   is a very simple one like translation.
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:03.780]   And so then there becomes a question,
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:07.940]   like what are the symmetries of the actual world
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:09.780]   with its physical laws?
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:12.860]   And one way of thinking, this is an oversimplification,
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:15.940]   but like one way of thinking of this big shift
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:22.380]   from before Einstein to after
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.260]   is that we just changed our idea
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:29.740]   about what the fundamental group of symmetries were.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:31.780]   So that things like the Lorenz contraction,
[02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:34.300]   things like these bizarre relativistic phenomena
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:37.660]   where Lorenz would have said, oh, to make this work,
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:42.660]   we need a thing to change its shape.
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:47.460]   If it's moving nearly the speed of light.
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:50.260]   Well, under the new framework, it's much better.
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.700]   He's like, oh no, it wasn't changing its shape.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.420]   You were just wrong about what counted as a symmetry.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:57.380]   Now that we have this new group, the so-called Lorenz group,
[02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:59.220]   now that we understand what the symmetries really are,
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:00.300]   we see it was just an illusion
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:02.940]   that the thing was changing its shape.
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:05.780]   - Yeah, so you can then describe the sameness of things
[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:08.820]   under this weirdness that is general relativity,
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:09.660]   for example.
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:14.420]   - Yeah, yeah, still.
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:16.940]   I wish there was a simpler explanation of exact,
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:19.820]   I mean, gauge symmetries,
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:22.380]   pretty simple general concept
[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:24.360]   about rulers being deformed.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:29.820]   It's just that I've actually just personally
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:34.740]   been on a search, not a very rigorous or aggressive search,
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:38.000]   but for something I personally enjoy,
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000]   which is taking complicated concepts
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.800]   and finding the minimal example
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:47.600]   that I can play around with, especially programmatically.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.440]   - That's great.
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:50.220]   This is what we try to train our students to do, right?
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:52.620]   I mean, in class, this is exactly what,
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.600]   this is best pedagogical practice.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.380]   - I do hope there's simple explanation,
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:02.380]   especially I've, in my drunk, random walk,
[02:13:02.380 --> 02:13:06.620]   drunk walk, whatever that's called,
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:09.120]   sometimes stumble into the world of topology
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:13.140]   and quickly, you know when you go into a party
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:16.000]   and you realize this is not the right party for me?
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.780]   So whenever I go into topology,
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:22.220]   it's like so much math everywhere.
[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:23.300]   I don't even know what,
[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:26.300]   it feels like, this is me being a hater,
[02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:27.620]   I think there's way too much math.
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.980]   Like there are two, the cool kids who just wanna have,
[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:33.140]   like everything is expressed through math
[02:13:33.140 --> 02:13:35.060]   because they're actually afraid to express stuff
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:37.140]   simply through language.
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.620]   That's my hater formulation of topology.
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:41.620]   But at the same time, I'm sure that's very necessary
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.260]   to do sort of rigorous discussion.
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:44.660]   But I feel like--
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:46.300]   - But don't you think that's what gauge symmetry is like?
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:47.500]   I mean, it's not a field I know well,
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:48.540]   but it certainly seems like--
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:49.820]   - Yes, it is like that.
[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:52.500]   But my problem with topology, okay,
[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:56.620]   and even like differential geometry,
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:14:00.980]   is like you're talking about beautiful things.
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.940]   Like if they could be visualized,
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:05.620]   it's open question if everything could be visualized,
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:06.780]   but you're talking about things
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:09.860]   that could be visually stunning, I think.
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:14.400]   But they are hidden underneath all of that math.
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:19.220]   Like if you look at the papers that are written in topology,
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:21.580]   if you look at all the discussions on Stack Exchange,
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:23.940]   they're all math dense, math heavy.
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.220]   And the only kind of visual things
[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:29.540]   that emerge every once in a while
[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:32.700]   is like something like a Mobius strip.
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:33.540]   Every once in a while,
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:38.540]   some kind of simple visualizations.
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:40.460]   Well, there's the vibration,
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:41.780]   there's the hop vibration,
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:43.140]   or all of those kinds of things
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:46.660]   that some grad student from like 20 years ago
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:50.180]   wrote a program in Fortran to visualize it, and that's it.
[02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:52.620]   And it just, you know, it makes me sad
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:55.020]   because those are visual disciplines,
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:57.900]   just like computer vision is a visual discipline.
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:14:59.660]   So you can provide a lot of visual examples.
[02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:03.340]   I wish topology was more excited
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:07.180]   and in love with visualizing some of the ideas.
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:08.060]   - I mean, you could say that,
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:09.020]   but I would say for me,
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:11.900]   a picture of the hop vibration does nothing for me.
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:13.140]   Whereas like when you're like,
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:14.700]   oh, it's like about the quaternions,
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:16.060]   it's like a subgroup of the quaternions,
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:17.860]   and I'm like, oh, so now I see what's going on.
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:18.860]   Like, why didn't you just say that?
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:20.540]   Why were you like showing me this stupid picture
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:22.420]   instead of telling me what you were talking about?
[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:24.980]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:25.820]   - I'm just saying, no,
[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:27.340]   but it goes back to what you were saying about teaching,
[02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:29.740]   that like people are different in what they'll respond to.
[02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:31.020]   So I think there's no, I mean,
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:32.460]   I'm very opposed to the idea
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:34.380]   that there's one right way to explain things.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:37.220]   I think there's a huge variation in like, you know,
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:39.020]   our brains like have all these like weird,
[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:40.860]   like hooks and loops,
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:43.260]   and it's like very hard to know like what's gonna latch on,
[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:46.100]   and it's not gonna be the same thing for everybody.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:49.460]   So I think monoculture is bad, right?
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:51.540]   I think that's, and I think we're agreeing on that point,
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:53.300]   that like, it's good that there's like
[02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:54.580]   a lot of different ways in
[02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:56.460]   and a lot of different ways to describe these ideas
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:58.100]   because different people are gonna find
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:15:59.740]   different things illuminating.
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:04.420]   - But that said, I think there's a lot to be discovered
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:09.420]   when you force little like silos of brilliant people
[02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:15.260]   to kind of find a middle ground,
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:20.220]   or like aggregate or come together in a way.
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:23.560]   So there's like people that do love visual things.
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:25.740]   I mean, there's a lot of disciplines,
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:27.020]   especially in computer science,
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.140]   that are obsessed with visualizing, visualizing data,
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:31.500]   visualizing neural networks.
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:34.100]   I mean, neural networks themselves are fundamentally visual.
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:36.820]   There's a lot of work in computer vision that's very visual.
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:39.140]   And then coming together with some folks
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:41.140]   that were like deeply rigorous
[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:43.620]   and are like totally lost in multi-dimensional space
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.220]   where it's hard to even bring them back down to 3D.
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:50.300]   They're very comfortable in this multi-dimensional space.
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:53.500]   So forcing them to kind of work together to communicate,
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:57.300]   because it's not just about public communication of ideas.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:59.180]   It's also, I feel like when you're forced
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:00.580]   to do that public communication,
[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:02.100]   like you did with your book,
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:05.780]   I think deep, profound ideas can be discovered
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:08.740]   that's like applicable for research and for science.
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.980]   Like there's something about that simplification,
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:15.380]   not simplification, but distillation or condensation
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:17.020]   or whatever the hell you call it,
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:19.860]   compression of ideas that somehow
[02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:22.160]   actually stimulates creativity.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.220]   And I'd be excited to see more of that
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:27.820]   in the mathematics community.
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:28.660]   Can you--
[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:29.500]   - Let me make a crazy metaphor.
[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:31.140]   Maybe it's a little bit like the relation
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:32.620]   between prose and poetry, right?
[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:33.700]   I mean, you might say,
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:34.980]   "Why do we need anything more than prose?
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:36.460]   "You're trying to convey some information."
[02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:38.500]   So you just say it.
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.500]   Well, poetry does something, right?
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:43.340]   It's sort of, you might think of it as a kind of compression.
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:44.940]   Of course, not all poetry is compressed.
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:47.660]   Like not all, some of it is quite baggy.
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:52.660]   But like you are kind of, often it's compressed, right?
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:55.600]   A lyric poem is often sort of like a compression
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.740]   of what would take a long time
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:00.300]   and be complicated to explain in prose
[02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:03.300]   into sort of a different mode
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:05.360]   that is gonna hit in a different way.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:08.980]   - We talked about Poincaré conjecture.
[02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:14.640]   There's a guy, he's Russian, Grigori Perlman.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.600]   He proved Poincaré's conjecture.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:19.180]   If you can comment on the proof itself,
[02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:21.560]   if that stands out to you as something interesting,
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:23.160]   or the human story of it,
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:26.960]   which is he turned down the Fields Medal for the proof.
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:32.760]   Is there something you find inspiring or insightful
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:36.160]   about the proof itself or about the man?
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:40.600]   - Yeah, I mean, one thing I really like about the proof,
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:42.920]   and partly that's because it's sort of a thing
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:45.080]   that happens again and again in this book.
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:46.480]   I mean, I'm writing about geometry
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:47.740]   and the way it sort of appears
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:50.200]   in all these kind of real world problems.
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.720]   But it happens so often that the geometry
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:56.920]   you think you're studying is somehow not enough.
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:59.240]   You have to go one level higher in abstraction
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.600]   and study a higher level of geometry.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:04.080]   And the way that plays out is that,
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:06.380]   Poincaré asks a question about a certain kind
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:07.840]   of three-dimensional object.
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.320]   Is it the usual three-dimensional space that we know,
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:13.060]   or is it some kind of exotic thing?
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:15.120]   And so of course, this sounds like it's a question
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:17.600]   about the geometry of the three-dimensional space.
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:20.200]   But no, Perelman understands.
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:21.920]   And by the way, in a tradition that involves
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.560]   Richard Hamilton and many other people,
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.320]   like most really important mathematical advances,
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:27.400]   this doesn't happen alone.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:28.480]   It doesn't happen in a vacuum.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:30.160]   It happens as the culmination of a program
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:31.280]   that involves many people.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.400]   Same with Wiles, by the way.
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:33.480]   I mean, we talked about Wiles,
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:36.200]   and I want to emphasize that starting all the way back
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:38.160]   with Kummer, who I mentioned in the 19th century,
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:42.200]   but Gerhard Frey and Maser and Ken Ribbit
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.200]   and like many other people are involved
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.200]   in building the other pieces of the arch
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:48.280]   before you put the keystone in.
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:50.360]   - We stand on the shoulders of giants.
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:51.180]   - Yes.
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:56.080]   So what is this idea?
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.420]   The idea is that, well, of course,
[02:19:57.420 --> 02:19:59.900]   the geometry of the three-dimensional object itself
[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:01.640]   is relevant, but the real geometry,
[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:04.720]   you have to understand, is the geometry of the space
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:07.400]   of all three-dimensional geometries.
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.680]   Whoa.
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.520]   You're going up a higher level.
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:12.000]   Because when you do that, you can say,
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:17.000]   now let's trace out a path in that space.
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.800]   There's a mechanism called Ricci flow.
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.080]   And again, we're outside my research area,
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:23.320]   so for all the geometric analysts
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.760]   and differential geometers out there listening to this,
[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:29.440]   if I, please, I'm doing my best and I'm roughly saying it.
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:32.200]   So the Ricci flow allows you to say like,
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:35.360]   okay, let's start from some mystery three-dimensional space,
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.720]   which Poincaré would conjecture is essentially
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:39.480]   the same thing as our familiar three-dimensional space,
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:41.200]   but we don't know that.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:44.120]   And now you let it flow.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:47.460]   You sort of like let it move in its natural path,
[02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:50.080]   according to some almost physical process,
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:51.400]   and ask where it winds up.
[02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:54.320]   And what you find is that it always winds up.
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:55.680]   You've continuously deformed it.
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.280]   There's that word deformation again.
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:00.160]   And what you can prove is that the process doesn't stop
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.080]   until you get to the usual three-dimensional space.
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:04.640]   And since you can get from the mystery thing
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:08.400]   to the standard space by this process of continually changing
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:13.000]   and never kind of having any sharp transitions,
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.320]   then the original shape must have been the same
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:17.520]   as the standard shape.
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.800]   That's the nature of the proof.
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:20.480]   Now, of course, it's incredibly technical.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.520]   I think, as I understand it,
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:23.400]   I think the hard part is proving
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:25.680]   that the favorite word of AI people,
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.920]   you don't get any singularities along the way.
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.520]   But of course, in this context,
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:34.400]   singularity just means acquiring a sharp kink.
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:37.040]   It just means becoming non-smooth at some point.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:41.000]   So just saying something interesting about formal,
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.400]   about the smooth trajectory through this weird space.
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:46.720]   - Yeah, but yeah, so what I like about it
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:48.280]   is that it's just one of many examples
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:51.640]   of where it's not about the geometry you think it's about.
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:55.960]   It's about the geometry of all geometries, so to speak.
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:59.360]   And it's only by kind of like being jerked out of Flatland,
[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:00.200]   right, same idea.
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:04.120]   It's only by sort of seeing the whole thing globally at once
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:05.840]   that you can really make progress on understanding
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:08.440]   the one thing you thought you were looking at.
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:09.520]   - It's a romantic question,
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:11.160]   but what do you think about him
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:13.000]   turning down the Fields Medal?
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.040]   Is that just, are Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:20.000]   just the cherry on top of the cake
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.960]   and really math itself,
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:25.240]   the process of curiosity,
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:28.480]   of pulling at the string of the mystery before us,
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:29.560]   that's the cake?
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:33.800]   And then the awards are just icing.
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:37.200]   - Man, clearly I've been fasting and I'm hungry,
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:42.200]   but do you think it's tragic
[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:46.360]   or just a little curiosity that he turned down the medal?
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:48.400]   - Well, it's interesting because on the one hand,
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.760]   I think it's absolutely true that right,
[02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:55.440]   in some kind of like vast spiritual sense,
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:57.320]   like awards are not important,
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:59.240]   like not important the way that sort of like
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:01.240]   understanding the universe is important.
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:03.320]   On the other hand,
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:05.440]   most people who are offered that prize accept it.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:10.440]   It's, so there's something unusual about his choice there.
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:14.400]   I wouldn't say I see it as tragic.
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.200]   I mean, maybe if I don't really feel like
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:19.280]   I have a clear picture of why he chose not to take it.
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.120]   I mean, it's not,
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:22.080]   he's not alone in doing things like this.
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:25.280]   People sometimes turn down prizes for ideological reasons,
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:28.000]   probably more often in mathematics.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.720]   I mean, I think I'm right in saying that Peter Schultz
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:33.880]   like turned down sort of some big monetary prize
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:36.600]   'cause he just, you know, I mean, I think he,
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:39.200]   at some point you have plenty of money
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:41.280]   and maybe you think it sends the wrong message
[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:44.360]   about what the point of doing mathematics is.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.520]   - I do find that there's--
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:47.480]   - But most people accept.
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:48.800]   You know, most people give it a prize,
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:49.620]   most people take it.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:50.840]   I mean, people like to be appreciated,
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:52.480]   but like I said, we're people.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.320]   - Yes.
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:54.640]   - Not that different from most other people.
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:57.840]   - But the important reminder that that turning down
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:01.480]   the prize serves for me is not that there's anything wrong
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:03.600]   with the prize and there's something wonderful
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:04.960]   about the prize, I think.
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:07.640]   The Nobel prize is trickier
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:10.360]   because so many Nobel prizes are given.
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:12.320]   First of all, the Nobel prize often forgets
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:15.640]   many of the important people throughout history.
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:18.960]   Second of all, there's like these weird rules to it
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.120]   that's only three people and some projects
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:24.080]   have a huge number of people and it's like this,
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:29.080]   it, I don't know, it doesn't kind of highlight
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:32.280]   the way science has done on some of these projects
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.660]   in the best possible way.
[02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:34.960]   But in general, the prizes are great.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:37.360]   But what this kind of teaches me and reminds me
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.920]   is sometimes in your life, there'll be moments
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:46.200]   when the thing that you would really like to do,
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:49.620]   society would really like you to do
[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:53.920]   is the thing that goes against something you believe in,
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:56.040]   whatever that is, some kind of principle,
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:59.840]   and stand your ground in the face of that.
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:02.680]   It's something, I believe most people
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:05.120]   will have a few moments like that in their life,
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:06.440]   maybe one moment like that.
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:09.100]   And you have to do it, that's what integrity is.
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.160]   So it doesn't have to make sense to the rest of the world,
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.520]   but to stand on that, to say no, it's interesting.
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.480]   'Cause I think-- - But do you know
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:20.040]   that he turned down the prize in service of some principle?
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:20.960]   'Cause I don't know that.
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:22.720]   - Well, yes, that seems to be the inkling,
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:24.560]   but he has never made it super clear.
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:26.960]   But the inkling is that he had some problems
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.720]   with the whole process of mathematics
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:32.000]   that includes awards, like this hierarchies
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.520]   and the reputations and all those kinds of things,
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:37.680]   and individualism that's fundamental to American culture.
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.200]   He probably, 'cause he visited the United States quite a bit,
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:46.200]   that he probably, it's all about experiences.
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:51.520]   And he may have had some parts of academia,
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:54.760]   some pockets of academia can be less than inspiring,
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:57.640]   perhaps sometimes, because of the individual egos involved.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:01.200]   Not academia, people in general, smart people with egos.
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.640]   And if you interact with a certain kinds of people,
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:07.480]   you can become cynical too easily.
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:10.760]   I'm one of those people that I've been really fortunate
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:12.840]   to interact with incredible people at MIT
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.560]   and academia in general, but I've met some assholes.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.080]   And I tend to just kind of,
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:19.200]   when I run into difficult folks,
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:21.360]   I just kind of smile and send them all my love
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.080]   and just kind of go around.
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:26.720]   But for others, those experiences can be sticky.
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:29.800]   Like they can become cynical about the world
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.640]   when folks like that exist.
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:35.480]   So he may have become a little bit cynical
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:37.200]   about the process of science.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:38.600]   - Well, you know, it's a good opportunity.
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:40.200]   Let's posit that that's his reasoning,
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:42.360]   'cause I truly don't know.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:43.800]   It's an interesting opportunity to go back
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:46.320]   to almost the very first thing we talked about,
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:48.360]   the idea of the Mathematical Olympiad.
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:50.520]   Because of course, that is,
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:52.120]   so the International Mathematical Olympiad
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:54.640]   is like a competition for high school students
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:55.880]   solving math problems.
[02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:59.240]   And in some sense, it's absolutely false
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:00.400]   to the reality of mathematics.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:03.760]   Because just as you say, it is a contest
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:05.240]   where you win prizes.
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:10.160]   The aim is to sort of be faster than other people.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:13.880]   And you're working on sort of canned problems
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:15.720]   that someone already knows the answer to,
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:18.520]   like not problems that are unknown.
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.600]   So, you know, in my own life,
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:21.960]   I think when I was in high school,
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:24.320]   I was like very motivated by those competitions.
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.160]   And like I went to the Math Olympiad.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:28.600]   - You won it twice and got, I mean.
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:30.200]   - Well, there's something I have to explain to people,
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:32.240]   because it says, I think it says on Wikipedia
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:33.480]   that I won a gold medal.
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:35.280]   And in the real Olympics,
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.440]   they only give one gold medal in each event.
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:38.520]   I just have to emphasize
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:40.840]   that the International Math Olympiad is not like that.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:42.240]   The gold medals are awarded
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:45.040]   to the top 1/12 of all participants.
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:47.320]   So sorry to bust the legend or anything like that.
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.840]   - Well, you're an exceptional performer
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:51.840]   in terms of achieving high scores on the problems,
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:53.240]   and they're very difficult.
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.280]   So you've achieved a high level of performance on the--
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:57.880]   - In this very specialized skill.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.520]   And by the way, it was a very Cold War activity.
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:04.640]   You know, in 1987, the first year I went, it was in Havana.
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:06.120]   Americans couldn't go to Havana back then.
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:08.720]   It was a very complicated process to get there.
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:10.120]   And they took the whole American team
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.600]   on a field trip to the Museum of American Imperialism
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:16.660]   in Havana so we could see what America was all about.
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:22.580]   - How would you recommend a person learn math?
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:26.380]   So somebody who's young or somebody my age
[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:29.740]   or somebody older who've taken a bunch of math
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:32.100]   but wants to rediscover the beauty of math
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:34.700]   and maybe integrate it into their work more so
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:38.540]   than the research space and so on.
[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:40.660]   Is there something you could say about the process
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:45.660]   of incorporating mathematical thinking into your life?
[02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:48.340]   - I mean, the thing is it's in part
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:49.700]   a journey of self-knowledge.
[02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:52.540]   You have to know what's gonna work for you
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:54.780]   and that's gonna be different for different people.
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:58.100]   So there are totally people who at any stage of life
[02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:00.820]   just start reading math textbooks.
[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:02.460]   That is a thing that you can do
[02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:05.420]   and it works for some people and not for others.
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:07.220]   For others, a gateway is, you know,
[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:09.620]   I always recommend like the books of Martin Gardner,
[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:11.420]   another sort of person we haven't talked about,
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:14.340]   but who also, like Conway, embodies that spirit
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:17.380]   of play, he wrote a column in Scientific American
[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:19.820]   for decades called "Mathematical Recreations"
[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:22.700]   and there's such joy in it and such fun.
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:25.380]   And these books, the columns are collected into books
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:27.500]   and the books are old now, but for each generation
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.140]   of people who discover them, they're completely fresh.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:32.540]   And they give a totally different way into the subject
[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:35.140]   than reading a formal textbook,
[02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:38.660]   which for some people would be the right thing to do.
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:40.900]   And, you know, working contest style problems too,
[02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:43.100]   those are bound to books, like especially like writing
[02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:44.580]   to books, like especially like Russian
[02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:45.660]   and Bulgarian problems, right?
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:47.780]   There's book after book of problems from those contexts.
[02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:50.060]   That's gonna motivate some people.
[02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:51.580]   For some people, it's gonna be like watching
[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:54.300]   well-produced videos, like a totally different format.
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:56.060]   Like I feel like I'm not answering your question.
[02:29:56.060 --> 02:29:57.780]   I'm sort of saying there's no one answer
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.340]   and like it's a journey where you figure out
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:01.900]   what resonates with you.
[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:04.300]   For some people, it's the self-discovery
[02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:06.780]   is trying to figure out why is it that I wanna know.
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:07.620]   Okay, I'll tell you a story.
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:10.540]   Once when I was in grad school, I was very frustrated
[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:12.500]   with my like lack of knowledge of a lot of things.
[02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:14.100]   As we all are, because no matter how much we know,
[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:15.820]   we don't know much more and going to grad school
[02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:18.780]   means just coming face to face with like the incredible
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:20.340]   overflowing vault of your ignorance, right?
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:23.740]   So I told Joe Harris, who was an algebraic geometer
[02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:26.540]   a professor in my department, I was like,
[02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:27.620]   I really feel like I don't know enough
[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:29.340]   and I should just like take a year of leave
[02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:32.620]   and just like read EGA, the holy textbook,
[02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:34.460]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:35.740]   elements of algebraic geometry.
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:38.700]   This like, I'm just gonna, I feel like I don't know enough.
[02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:42.060]   So I was gonna sit and like read this like 1500 page,
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:44.060]   many volume book.
[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:48.300]   And he was like, Professor Harris was like,
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:49.460]   that's a really stupid idea.
[02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:50.820]   And I was like, why is that a stupid idea?
[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:52.660]   Then I would know more algebraic geometry.
[02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:53.940]   He's like, because you're not actually gonna do it.
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:55.780]   Like you learn.
[02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.140]   I mean, he knew me well enough to say like,
[02:30:57.140 --> 02:30:58.860]   you're gonna learn because you're gonna be working
[02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:01.060]   on a problem and then there's gonna be a fact from EGA
[02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:03.020]   you need in order to solve your problem
[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:05.300]   that you wanna solve and that's how you're gonna learn it.
[02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:06.820]   You're not gonna learn it without a problem
[02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:07.980]   to bring you into it.
[02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:10.660]   And so for a lot of people, I think if you're like,
[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:12.420]   I'm trying to understand machine learning
[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:14.420]   and I'm like, I can see that there's sort of
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:19.420]   some mathematical technology that I don't have.
[02:31:19.420 --> 02:31:22.580]   I think you like let that problem
[02:31:22.580 --> 02:31:26.020]   that you actually care about drive your learning.
[02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:27.860]   I mean, one thing I've learned from advising students,
[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:31.140]   you know, math is really hard.
[02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:35.860]   In fact, anything that you do right is hard.
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:40.140]   And because it's hard, like,
[02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:42.260]   you might sort of have some idea that somebody else gives you
[02:31:42.260 --> 02:31:44.460]   oh, I should learn X, Y, and Z.
[02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:46.380]   Well, if you don't actually care, you're not gonna do it.
[02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:47.420]   You might feel like you should,
[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:48.860]   maybe somebody told you you should,
[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:51.740]   but I think you have to hook it to something
[02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:52.700]   that you actually care about.
[02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:54.500]   So for a lot of people, that's the way in.
[02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:57.180]   You have an engineering problem you're trying to handle.
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:59.500]   You have a physics problem you're trying to handle.
[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:02.020]   You have a machine learning problem you're trying to handle.
[02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:04.980]   Let that, not a kind of abstract idea
[02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:08.340]   of what the curriculum is, drive your mathematical learning.
[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:12.180]   - And also just as a brief comment, that math is hard.
[02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:15.220]   There's a sense to which hard is a feature, not a bug.
[02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:16.980]   In the sense that, again,
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:19.740]   maybe this is my own learning preference,
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:23.660]   but I think it's a value to fall in love
[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:26.020]   with the process of doing something hard,
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:29.220]   overcoming it, and becoming a better person
[02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:31.060]   because like, I hate running.
[02:32:31.060 --> 02:32:34.500]   I hate exercise to bring it down to like the simplest hard.
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:39.780]   And I enjoy the part once it's done,
[02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:42.020]   the person I feel like for the rest of the day
[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:43.100]   once I've accomplished it.
[02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:45.180]   The actual process, especially the process
[02:32:45.180 --> 02:32:47.540]   of getting started in the initial,
[02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:49.580]   like it really, I don't feel like doing it.
[02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:51.660]   And I really have, the way I feel about running
[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:55.140]   is the way I feel about really anything difficult
[02:32:55.140 --> 02:32:58.500]   in the intellectual space, especially in mathematics,
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:01.860]   but also just something that requires
[02:33:01.860 --> 02:33:04.860]   like holding a bunch of concepts in your mind
[02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:08.260]   with some uncertainty, like where the terminology
[02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:10.260]   or the notation is not very clear.
[02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:13.340]   And so you have to kind of hold all those things together
[02:33:13.340 --> 02:33:16.060]   and like keep pushing forward through the frustration
[02:33:16.060 --> 02:33:19.660]   of really like obviously not understanding certain,
[02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:21.660]   like parts of the picture,
[02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:24.380]   like your giant missing parts of the picture,
[02:33:24.380 --> 02:33:26.580]   and still not giving up.
[02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:29.020]   It's the same way I feel about running.
[02:33:29.020 --> 02:33:32.820]   And there's something about falling in love
[02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:36.140]   with the feeling of after you went through the journey
[02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.180]   of not having a complete picture,
[02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:40.620]   at the end, having a complete picture,
[02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:42.460]   and then you get to appreciate the beauty
[02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:46.020]   and just remembering that it sucked for a long time
[02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:48.780]   and how great it felt when you figured it out,
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:49.940]   at least at the basic.
[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:52.020]   That's not sort of research thinking,
[02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:55.220]   'cause with research, you probably also have to
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:57.260]   enjoy the dead ends.
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:02.540]   With learning math from a textbook or from video,
[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:03.380]   there's a nice--
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:04.580]   - I don't think you have to enjoy the dead ends,
[02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:06.340]   but I think you have to accept the dead ends.
[02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:07.960]   Let's put it that way.
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:11.180]   - Well, yeah, enjoy the suffering of it.
[02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:17.060]   The way I think about it, I do, there's an--
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:19.060]   - I don't enjoy the suffering, it pisses me off,
[02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:21.220]   but I accept that it's part of the process.
[02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:22.420]   - It's interesting, there's a lot of ways
[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:24.540]   to kind of deal with that dead end.
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:26.420]   There's a guy who's an ultra marathon runner,
[02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:30.060]   Navy SEAL, David Goggins, who kind of,
[02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:32.800]   I mean, there's a certain philosophy of like,
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:36.000]   most people would quit here.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.420]   And so if most people would quit here, and I don't,
[02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:45.140]   I'll have an opportunity to discover something beautiful
[02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:46.400]   that others haven't yet.
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:52.900]   So like, any feeling that really sucks,
[02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:56.940]   it's like, okay, most people would just like
[02:34:56.940 --> 02:34:58.620]   go do something smarter.
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:03.100]   And if I stick with this, I will discover a new garden
[02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:06.100]   of fruit trees that I can pick.
[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:08.340]   - Okay, you say that, but like, what about the guy
[02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:11.260]   who like wins the Nathan's hot dog eating contest every year?
[02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:13.980]   Like when he eats his 35th hot dog, he like correctly says,
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:16.020]   like, okay, most people would stop here.
[02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:18.420]   Are you like lauding that he's like,
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:19.980]   no, I'm gonna eat the 36th hot dog?
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:21.580]   - I am, I am, I am.
[02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:26.260]   In the long arc of history, that man is onto something.
[02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:28.380]   Which brings up this question.
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:30.940]   What advice would you give to young people today,
[02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:33.980]   thinking about their career, about their life,
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:37.260]   whether it's in mathematics, poetry,
[02:35:37.260 --> 02:35:39.340]   or hot dog eating contest?
[02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:40.620]   (laughing)
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:42.740]   - And you know, I have kids, so this is actually
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:43.860]   a live issue for me, right?
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:45.700]   I actually, it's not a thought experiment.
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:47.900]   I actually do have to give advice to young people
[02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:48.740]   all the time.
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:50.540]   They don't listen, but I still give it.
[02:35:50.540 --> 02:35:55.340]   You know, one thing I often say to students,
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:56.740]   I don't think I've actually said this to my kids yet,
[02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:58.980]   but I say it to students a lot, is,
[02:35:58.980 --> 02:36:02.020]   you know, you come to these decision points,
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:06.620]   and everybody is beset by self-doubt, right?
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:09.740]   It's like, not sure what they're capable of,
[02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:14.740]   like, not sure what they really wanna do.
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:16.540]   I always, I sort of tell people, like,
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:18.460]   often when you have a decision to make,
[02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:22.740]   one of the choices is the high self-esteem choice.
[02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:24.620]   And I always tell them, make the high self-esteem choice.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:26.780]   Make the choice, sort of take yourself out of it,
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:29.620]   and like, if you didn't have those,
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:32.180]   you can probably figure out what the version of you
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:34.180]   that feels completely confident would do,
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:36.500]   and do that, and see what happens.
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:40.100]   And I think that's often, like, pretty good advice.
[02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:41.860]   - That's interesting, sort of like,
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:44.980]   you know, like with Sims, you can create characters.
[02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:47.820]   Like, create a character of yourself
[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:50.260]   that lacks all of the self-doubt.
[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:52.940]   - Right, but it doesn't mean, I would never say to somebody,
[02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:56.220]   you should just go have high self-esteem.
[02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:57.180]   You shouldn't have doubts.
[02:36:57.180 --> 02:36:58.220]   No, you probably should have doubts.
[02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:01.340]   It's okay to have them, but sometimes it's good to act
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:04.260]   in the way that the person who didn't have them would act.
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:08.460]   - That's a really nice way to put it.
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:13.060]   Yeah, that's like, from a third-person perspective,
[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:16.540]   take the part of your brain that wants to do big things.
[02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:18.180]   What would they do?
[02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:20.060]   That's not afraid to do those things.
[02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:21.500]   What would they do?
[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:24.420]   Yeah, that's really nice.
[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:26.340]   That's actually a really nice way to formulate it.
[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:27.540]   That's very practical advice.
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:29.100]   You should give it to your kids.
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:32.660]   Do you think there's meaning to any of it,
[02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:35.780]   from a mathematical perspective, this life?
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:40.900]   If I were to ask you, we're talking about primes,
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:42.480]   talking about proving stuff.
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:47.340]   Can we say, and then the book that God has,
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:50.540]   that mathematics allows us to arrive at something about,
[02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:52.820]   in that book, there's certainly a chapter
[02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:54.980]   on the meaning of life in that book.
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:57.380]   Do you think we humans can get to it?
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:37:59.500]   And maybe, if you were to write Cliff Notes,
[02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:01.500]   what do you suspect those Cliff Notes would say?
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.340]   - I mean, look, the way I feel is that,
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.900]   you know, mathematics, as we've discussed,
[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:07.580]   like it underlies the way we think
[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:09.220]   about constructing learning machines.
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:10.560]   It underlies physics.
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:14.600]   It can be, I mean, it does all this stuff.
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:17.180]   And also, you want the meaning of life?
[02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:18.820]   I mean, it's like, we already did a lot for you.
[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:19.880]   Like, ask a rabbi.
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:22.600]   (laughing)
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:24.680]   No, I mean, I think, you know, I wrote a lot
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:27.720]   in the last book, How Not to Be Wrong.
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:30.660]   I wrote a lot about Pascal, a fascinating guy,
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:35.120]   who is a sort of very serious religious mystic,
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.200]   as well as being an amazing mathematician.
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:38.860]   And he's well-known for Pascal's Wager.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:40.240]   I mean, he's probably, among all mathematicians,
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:42.320]   he's the one who's best known for this,
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:44.120]   can you actually apply mathematics
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.880]   to kind of these transcendent questions?
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:53.040]   But what's interesting, when I really read Pascal
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.560]   about what he wrote about this,
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:56.320]   you know, I started to see that people often think,
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.960]   oh, this is him saying, I'm gonna use mathematics
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.340]   to sort of show you why you should believe in God.
[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:04.480]   You know, to really, that's,
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:07.240]   mathematics has the answer to this question.
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:08.920]   But he really doesn't say that.
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.880]   He almost kind of says the opposite.
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:15.160]   If you ask Blaise Pascal, like, why do you believe in God?
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:16.600]   He'd be like, oh, 'cause I met God.
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:20.160]   You know, he had this kind of like psychedelic experience,
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:23.400]   this like mystical experience, where, as he tells it,
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:24.960]   he just like directly encountered God.
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:26.060]   It's like, okay, I guess there's a God.
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:27.960]   I met him last night, so that's it.
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:29.120]   That's why he believed.
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:30.320]   It didn't have to do with any kind of,
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:32.520]   you know, the mathematical argument was like
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:36.760]   about certain reasons for behaving in a certain way.
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:38.320]   But he basically said, like, look,
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:41.080]   like math doesn't tell you that God's there or not.
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:44.360]   Like, if God's there, he'll tell you, you know?
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:45.720]   You don't even-- - I love this.
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:50.440]   So you have mathematics, you have, what do you have?
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:53.760]   Like, ways to explore the mind, let's say psychedelics.
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:56.600]   You have like incredible technology.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.640]   You also have love and friendship.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:01.800]   And like, what the hell do you wanna know
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:02.880]   what the meaning of it all is?
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:04.920]   Just enjoy it. (laughs)
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:07.000]   I don't think there's a better way to end it, Jordan.
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.520]   This was a fascinating conversation.
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:13.520]   I really love the way you explore math in your writing,
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:18.440]   the willingness to be specific and clear
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:21.200]   and actually explore difficult ideas,
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.120]   but at the same time stepping outside
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:25.080]   and figuring out beautiful stuff.
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:30.080]   And I love the chart at the opening of your new book
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:33.280]   that shows the chaos, the mess that is your mind.
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:35.560]   - Yes, this is what I was trying to keep in my head
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:38.040]   all at once while I was writing.
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:40.680]   And I probably should have drawn this picture earlier
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:41.520]   in the process.
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:43.080]   Maybe it would have made my organization easier.
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:45.400]   I actually drew it only at the end.
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:48.600]   - And many of the things we talked about are on this map.
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:51.800]   The connections are yet to be fully dissected
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:52.640]   and investigated.
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:56.720]   And yes, God is in the picture.
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:59.480]   - Right on the edge, right on the edge, not in the center.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:01.660]   - Thank you so much for talking to me.
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:03.440]   It is a huge honor that you would waste
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:04.840]   your valuable time with me.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:06.680]   - Thank you, Lex.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:07.800]   We went to some amazing places today.
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.640]   This was really fun.
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:11.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.360]   with Jordan Ellenberg.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:16.640]   And thank you to Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:18.000]   and Indeed.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.360]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.120]   And now let me leave you with some words from Jordan
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:26.640]   in his book, "How Not to Be Wrong."
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.600]   "Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of X-ray specs
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:33.500]   that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:35.780]   and chaotic surface of the world."
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:38.520]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:41.100]   (upbeat music)
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:43.680]   (upbeat music)
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:53.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
