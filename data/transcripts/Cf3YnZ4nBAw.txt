[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.000]   is the subject of our talk today.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.240]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Dr. Wade Pfau.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.680]   Welcome, doctor.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.600]   Thanks, and feel free to call me Wade.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.160]   It's great to be on the podcast.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.960]   Well, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.680]   The Bogle Heads are extremely interested in the work
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.240]   that you're doing, and I think it's fascinating.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.520]   I've read all your books, and we've
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.880]   got a lot to talk about, a lot to get through today.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.120]   But before we get there, let's start
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   by having you tell us a little bit of something
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.000]   about yourself.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.400]   You decided to go into this field,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.080]   and what was your motivation?
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.640]   Sure.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.880]   Going back to the early days, I grew up in Michigan and Iowa,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.440]   went to--
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.960]   majored in economics, went to grad school for economics.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.440]   And then from there, just slowly started
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   stumbling into personal financial planning.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.800]   My dissertation was about the Bush Commission proposal
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.880]   to create personal retirement accounts
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.360]   by carving out part of Social Security.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.520]   I was just exploring how that might work out in practice.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.960]   And that really became the foundation
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.760]   for what I'm doing today in terms
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.720]   of simulating retirement outcomes based
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.280]   on different strategies.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.080]   I did spend 10 years in Japan as an economics professor.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440]   That was my first job out of grad school,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.560]   focusing more on the pension systems
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.000]   and developing in emerging market countries.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.240]   But in wanting to move to the US and find something
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.080]   more marketable here, started studying for the CFA curriculum
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.240]   and so forth.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.840]   And I came across this 4% rule of thumb
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.560]   about how much you could spend from a retirement portfolio.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   So from that, I had another data set, the 4% rules,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.640]   just based on US historical data.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.480]   But I had the global returns data
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.200]   for 20 developed market countries.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.880]   And I was curious, did the 4% rule
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.120]   work with other countries' data?
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.280]   And that really became my introduction
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.440]   into the world of retirement income.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.200]   When you started researching safe retirement rates using
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.720]   basically what you call the probability-based system, which
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.280]   is a stock and bond and cash portfolio,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   you discovered that there was risks to that.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.480]   And basically, you came up with three risks--
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.200]   longevity risk, a sequence of return risk,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.840]   and also spending shocks.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.560]   And those three things together gave you the idea
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.640]   that maybe that's not the most optimal way
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.320]   to build a portfolio for retirement.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.720]   Could you explain those risks and why it may not
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.200]   be the most optimal way?
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.720]   Right.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.320]   I mean, the 4% rule, this idea that if I had a million dollars,
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   I could take out $40,000 in the first year
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.480]   and then every year just spend that same amount
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.960]   with inflation adjustments.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   That's the fundamental way the investments world thinks
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.960]   about retirement income.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.840]   Of course, there's a lot of variations on it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.240]   But that's the fundamental idea.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.600]   And the way it seeks to manage these three
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.880]   types of retirement risks may not be the most efficient way.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.440]   With longevity risk, this is the idea
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.000]   that you might live longer than anticipated.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.960]   The 4% rule is meant to be conservative in the sense
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.480]   that it plans for longer-than-life expectancy.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.920]   In 1994, the article was written,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.200]   which now is 26 years ago.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.400]   The idea was a 65-year-old couple--
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   it's pretty unlikely that either of them would live past 95.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.280]   So if you build a plan that worked for 30 years,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.680]   you should be in good shape.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.360]   Now, there's no protection there.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.160]   You might live longer than 30 years.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.760]   But at least you're trying to be conservative in that regard.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.120]   And then it's the same sort of story with the market risk.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.360]   The 4% rule, it introduced the idea
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.520]   of sequence of returns risk into financial planning
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.560]   because it accounted for how the market volatility impacted
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.680]   a sustainable spending rate.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.280]   And it was based on the worst-case 30-year period
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.520]   in terms of not necessarily the average return over 30 years,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.280]   but the retirement that had the most negative experience early
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.440]   in the 30 years.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   And well, in this case, it was in the mid-1960s.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.600]   Markets do great after about 1982,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.920]   but it was still this worst-case scenario
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.120]   through the sequence of returns risk.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.960]   But you try to spend conservatively,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.080]   that your plan will work in the worst-case 30-year period
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.680]   from history.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.360]   And so people who are comfortable with it
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.440]   are comfortable with that being an appropriate way
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.840]   to manage the market risk in the sequence of returns risk
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.080]   based on a worst-case historical experience.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.720]   And then the spending shocks.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.000]   So these are, well, I've got my baseline retirement budget.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.200]   I want to spend the $40,000 a year.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.160]   But I may have surprises along the way
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.520]   with long-term care, big health care
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   bills, different types of events that can happen.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.320]   And the 4% rule, strictly speaking,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.600]   doesn't help manage spending shocks
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.040]   because it does anticipate just spending your budget,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.680]   you're going to end up with zero after 30 years.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.280]   But that's only supposed to happen
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.640]   in the worst-case scenario.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.080]   So if you're in any other sort of scenario,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.760]   you don't necessarily end up at zero.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.560]   And so you would have some excess funds
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.920]   available to provide a source of spending for spending shocks.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.400]   And that's how the 4% rule manages
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.600]   those types of retirement risks.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.440]   Now, it's not necessarily the most efficient way
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.320]   to manage these risks because it really just
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.360]   means I'm going to be extra conservative to try
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.040]   to not run out of money.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.520]   I may not be conservative enough.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.760]   There could be a new worst-case scenario.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.920]   But most of the time, I would just end up underspending
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.320]   and then have a bigger legacy at the end
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.280]   than I otherwise had anticipated.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.400]   But you also wrote in your latest book,
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.800]   Safety First Retirement Planning,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.120]   which is a whole different way of doing this, that--
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.680]   and I'll quote-- "there is no such thing as a safe withdrawal
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.600]   rate.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.840]   A safe withdrawal rate is unknown and unknowable."
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.280]   So your research has shown that even if you said,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.040]   well, let's make it a 3% rate instead of a 4% rate,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.000]   even then it might not work.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.080]   Yeah, that's just kind of the academic concept behind,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.880]   well, if you are trying to spend a fixed amount
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   from a volatile investment portfolio,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.520]   that there really is no such thing as a, quote unquote,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   "safe withdrawal rate."
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.880]   Anything could fail.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's the inherent issue of volatility with fixed spending.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.120]   And so if you wanted to have fixed spending,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.440]   you probably shouldn't have the volatility in the portfolio.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.800]   Or if you want the volatility in the portfolio,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.680]   your spending should also be flexible or volatile
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.720]   or adjust for the portfolio performance.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.240]   The 4% rule of thumb does assume you use 50% to 75% stocks
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.760]   throughout retirement.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.360]   And that inherently creates the most sequence risk,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   because it leaves you the most exposed
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.960]   to being forced to settle assets at a loss in a market downturn.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.280]   Right now, if I wanted the 30 years of inflation
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.240]   adjusted spending with where KIPP's yields are,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.920]   at this point, we're getting close to about a 3% safe
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.760]   withdrawal rate.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.200]   And that would ensure you run out of money
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.000]   at the end of 30 years, because you build a ladder of Treasury
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.440]   inflation-protected securities.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.240]   And if I'm trying to spend more than that,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.760]   I'm investing more aggressively.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.880]   I'm hoping and anticipating that the upside from the stock
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.560]   market will allow for a higher spending rate.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.760]   But if I get a poor sequence of market returns early on,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.680]   I end up having to sell principal
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.520]   and digging a hole for my portfolio.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.120]   And so the portfolio may not recover with the overall market.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.160]   And so that's really the risk created
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   by that sort of probability-based approach
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.720]   in the purest form, with how the 4% rule is structured.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.240]   And your solution to this is what's
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.800]   called the safety-first retirement approach, which
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.720]   would also feed in, basically, annuities, and life insurance,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.120]   and perhaps reverse mortgages, and other types of assets
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.960]   into the portfolio to try to mitigate the longevity risk.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.400]   So in a broad sense, could you talk
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.520]   about the safety-first retirement planning approach?
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.560]   So and to just be clear, I know some Bogleheads take issue
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.000]   with, which can be expensive assets to use, annuities.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.440]   We know life insurance, reverse mortgages,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.680]   all can have significant costs attached to them.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.080]   But what really-- and the reason I
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.120]   find that these things can help in retirement
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.680]   is because of this sequence of returns risk
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.120]   and how small changes to this need
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.160]   to take distributions from a portfolio at a loss
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.440]   can really disrupt the retirement plan,
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   and how just being able to cut back a little bit on that
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   can have such a huge positive net impact on the retirement
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.360]   plan, that that's kind of the avenue
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.000]   where these different types of tools can help.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It goes back to just looking at what's
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   the efficient frontier for retirement income
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.600]   with an article I wrote now about eight years ago,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.240]   and just finding that stock bond allocations are really
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.960]   the least efficient way to try to meet a spending
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   goal with downside market risk, while also preserving
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.880]   an average, like the highest average legacy at the end
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.800]   as well, that if you basically shift from bonds to income
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.880]   annuities so that--
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.720]   I mean, an income annuity is effectively a bond portfolio
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.920]   held by the insurance company.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.360]   But rather than paying coupons for a fixed number of years,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.080]   they pay for the lifetime.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.720]   They hedge your longevity risk.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.360]   If you end up living to 110, they pay you until you're 110.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.280]   Now, if you end up only living to 70,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.640]   they don't pay you until you're 70.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   But by pooling that risk, you can have your retirement
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.320]   outcome based more on an average experience,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.280]   rather than if you have this worry about outliving
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.000]   your money and therefore spend less,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.240]   just try to stretch those assets out for longer.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.800]   That's where the stock income annuity
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.680]   mix can work better for retirement
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   than a stock bond mix.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.760]   And that's a basic idea that safety first is.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.280]   It's based on more academic type models,
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.560]   going back at least to the 1920s, which
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.000]   is, if you have a basic spending floor where you really
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.840]   don't want your spending to have to drop
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.640]   below a particular level, the most efficient approach
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.720]   is you lock in that level with lifetime protections
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.440]   through risk pooling.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.280]   And then you can invest the rest more aggressively
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   and spend more aggressively at a variable rate, so something
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.600]   like just following RMD rules on here's
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.320]   how much I'm going to spend from my discretionary investment
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.760]   portfolio.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.800]   That increasing spending rate as I age
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.440]   from an aggressive portfolio mixed with an income floor,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.480]   that that's a more efficient way to build a retirement income
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.720]   strategy than something like using the 4% rule
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.360]   from a total return, like 60-40 style investment portfolio.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.480]   This sounds an awful lot like a replacement almost
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.880]   for defined benefit plans, which 50 years ago, a lot of workers
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.920]   had defined benefit plans, which were this annuity based
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.960]   on risk pooling, correct?
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.560]   And so people had this money coming in
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.000]   for the rest of their life.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.400]   Now that defined benefit plans have gone away,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.000]   it sounds like what you're advocating for at a basic sense
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   is to replace that.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.960]   And Moshe Molesky even calls it pensionize your nest egg.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.840]   That's the idea.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.800]   With Social Security and with traditional defined benefit
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.400]   pensions, we do get risk pooling.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.760]   And with a defined benefit pension,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.360]   the longevity risk is pooled.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   Some workers don't live as long as others, and some live longer.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.560]   And also market risk is pooled because the insurer,
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.480]   assuming they select the correct average,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.560]   they base outcomes on an average rate of return
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.240]   that some people would have been better off on their own
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.840]   with their own sequence of returns.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.640]   Others would have been worse off.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.920]   But that market risk over time gets pooled.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.640]   And so a defined benefit pension,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.160]   it pays your pension based on an average market performance
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   and based on a formula linked to your work history
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.960]   versus in a defined contribution pension,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.440]   where if you're investing that in a market portfolio,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.120]   you're now fully taking on the market
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.320]   risk of your specific sequence of returns.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.400]   And if you're going to do systematic distributions
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.640]   and not use any sort of annuity, you're
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.360]   then also taking on that longevity risk.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.920]   So indeed, annuities just provide a way
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.120]   to create that pension with that risk pooling
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.920]   that if you had a defined benefit pension,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.640]   you would have been getting that way before.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.920]   We're not talking about everybody here.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:15.480]   I think that the target market for what you're talking about
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.560]   are people who ordinarily would have had, say,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.520]   a defined benefit plan.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.240]   We're not talking about people who have $10 million
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.360]   and only spend $150,000 a year, correct?
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   Well, I mean, to some extent, correct.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.120]   But at the end of the day, it's still the same sort of idea
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.680]   that anyone--
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.560]   now, they're not going to run out of money, clearly.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   But to the extent that you take some of your bonds
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.680]   or if somebody in that situation might
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.720]   have a big pile of cash sitting on the sidelines,
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.360]   if you took some of that and put that into that lifetime income
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.760]   annuity, and then you feel all the more comfortable investing
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.520]   what's left more aggressively, though you're not
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.920]   going to run out of money anyway,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.840]   you're creating a better foundation
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.720]   that you're, at least if you live past life expectancy,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.400]   going to be able to leave behind a larger legacy than if you
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.160]   still just spent your $150,000 a year from a 60/40 allocation
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.200]   on a $10 million portfolio.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.960]   It's just this mathematical outcome
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.000]   that doesn't depend on the spending rate.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.600]   Now, if you are more constrained,
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.800]   you can see a more noticeable increase
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.280]   in your probability of success.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.480]   It's not that you're going to see the success rate increase
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:24.960]   there.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.640]   If you've got $10 million and you're
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.720]   spending $150,000 a year, your probability of success
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.200]   is probably 99% no matter what you do.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   But still, in terms of legacy, it's
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.800]   what's the most efficient way to build the retirement strategy?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.000]   And in that regard, using bonds to fund the retirement budget
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.360]   is really the least efficient way you can approach things.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.600]   I did a little math to take a look
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.360]   at if my wife and I decided to take $1 million
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.640]   and annuitize it at age 62--
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.720]   I am 62, and she's 60--
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   went to the website that you recommended,
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.080]   which is-- what's the website?
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.480]   Immediateannuities.com.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.760]   Immediateannuities.com.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.480]   OK, not a plug for Immediate Annuities.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.560]   We are non-commercial.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.960]   But I went there, and I plug in some numbers.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.520]   And I see, well, what could I get right now at 62?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   And my wife is 60.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.280]   If we put $1 million into this-- and it came out to $46,000
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.040]   a year, I believe it was, with 4.6%.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.080]   And then I said, what if I never spent that money?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.880]   What if I just took that money and I invested in it
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.040]   in Treasury bonds?
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.800]   So as the money came in, I invested in today's Treasury
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.760]   bond rates.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.520]   At what point would I actually make more money
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   than if I just took that million dollars
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.320]   and invested it in Treasury bonds?
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.560]   And quite frankly, doing that gave me a much higher legacy
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.440]   rate of return, as long as one of us lived until we were--
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.480]   I think it was one of us had to live until our 80s.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.000]   And if one of us lived until our 80s,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.400]   by taking the higher return from the annuity
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.200]   and just taking the income from that
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.680]   and investing it in the same Treasury bond
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.240]   that we would have bought, we ended up
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.480]   having a higher legacy.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.680]   So the return, if you live long enough,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   the return from the annuity is higher.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.560]   And if you could explain why that is.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.160]   It's not just interest rates that
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.920]   drive the return on an annuity, correct?
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.320]   It's the pool of investors that you're in.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:27.800]   Right.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.200]   I mean, the income annuity, you really
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.120]   want to think about it as the cash flows,
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.160]   because there is an underlying interest rate,
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.640]   but it's not reported.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.880]   It's part of the payout rate that you get quoted.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.920]   And that's what you see.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.200]   It's the payout rate.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.720]   If I put in a million dollars, how much
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.640]   will I get on a monthly and annual basis
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.360]   for the rest of my life?
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.000]   And so naturally, the longer you live,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.600]   the more cash flows you're getting back
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.520]   on your initial investment.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.720]   Now, with a pure life-only income annuity,
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.000]   the return is going to be negative
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.600]   until you get your full premium back as payments,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.880]   and then you'd have an internal rate of return of 0%.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.280]   And then as you live beyond life expectancy,
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.040]   your return gets higher and higher.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.880]   And if you live into your 90s, yeah, you're--
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.280]   or even to beat bonds, probably more like your mid
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   to late 80s.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.440]   Depending on what the interest rate was on the bond,
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.040]   it came out to 87 or so.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.560]   One of us had to live till we were 87.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.200]   And then if I would have just invested
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.520]   100% in a treasury bond versus investing in the annuity,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.600]   taking the money and put that into a treasury bond,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.880]   that's when I started making money in the annuity.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.280]   And if you're both in average health, at least--
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.720]   not even good health, but just average health--
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.000]   for a couple, the joint longevity
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.400]   is going to be higher than 87, especially
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.960]   if you're non-smokers, that you have a 50% chance that at least
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.000]   one of you is still alive in the early 90s.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.560]   So the probabilities are in your favor
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.400]   of living long enough, where you can beat out
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.760]   bonds with an income annuity.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.360]   You're right.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.400]   As far as a legacy asset and what
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   I'm going to leave to my children,
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.120]   even if I'm not going to be needing
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.960]   the income from an annuity, it's actually
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.840]   sometimes a good investment.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.320]   Right.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   If you're comparing just annuities versus bonds and not--
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.760]   because then you can add in the stock market as well.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.680]   But with annuities versus bonds, you're
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.720]   going to be lagging on the legacy for a while,
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.880]   because bonds, you still have the full liquidity for that.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.760]   But yeah, once you're past life expectancy--
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.560]   and then with the bonds, eventually, you're
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.320]   going to deplete that entirely.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.200]   And then you could talk about whether there's
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.120]   a reverse legacy.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.560]   Like, if I was just going to fund my retirement with bonds
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.360]   and I outlive the age that I anticipated,
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.800]   I'll need someone to take care of me at that point.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.640]   But with the annuity, though you may be giving up
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.800]   legacy in the early years-- and we're
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.400]   talking about a partial annuity strategy--
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.040]   in reality, no one's going to put all their money
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.640]   in the income annuity.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.200]   So legacies may lag for a while.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.360]   But if somebody ends up having a short retirement,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.840]   their heirs are going to be getting a lot anyway.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.560]   It's really with the long term, where you still
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.480]   can have a reasonable legacy with a partial annuity
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.080]   strategy versus with the bonds.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.680]   Eventually, they run out, and you don't have any spending
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.240]   source at that point.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   So it's changing the dynamics of what
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.880]   the legacy will be over time.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.600]   The annuity strategy will have a lower legacy
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.920]   before life expectancies, but a bigger legacy
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.600]   after life expectancies.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.440]   And that's because of that risk pooling,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.080]   where as you live longer, more and more of your spending
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.280]   is coming through the subsidies of these mortality credits
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.080]   that investments just simply don't provide.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.200]   It's the premiums from the short-lived helping
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.620]   to pay to the long-lived, raising
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.600]   that standard of living for everyone in that risk pool.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.520]   And that's what they call mortality credits.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.760]   In other words, I'm kind of making a bet
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   that I'm going to live longer than you,
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.440]   and we're all in the same pool together.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.520]   But I think my genes are better than your genes,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.120]   and my wife's genes are better than everybody else's genes
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.880]   in the pool, too.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.280]   So if we get in this pool, and if we actually win,
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.640]   we only have to be on the top 50% as far as our longevity,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.400]   if you will, we come out ahead.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.320]   Right, and you can't think of it that way.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   But often, behaviorally, it's not necessarily
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.160]   good to think about annuities as bets or investments.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.400]   Because you can frame any sort of insurance that way.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.920]   Like if I buy homeowners insurance,
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.440]   I'm making a bet that my house will burn down.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.620]   And if it does, I'll get this big payout.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.660]   And with the annuity, it's a little bit different.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.320]   It's to protect a good outcome in a scenario
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.680]   where I live a long time.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.760]   And therefore, my retirement becomes more expensive,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.960]   and I don't have the resources to fund that sort of longevity.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.080]   So it's insurance against outliving my assets
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.000]   more than it's a bet that will pay off
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.960]   if I beat the rest of the risk pool.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.040]   I mean, you can think about it either way.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.520]   Think about the insurance side as well.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.360]   When you're looking at your retirement plan,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.400]   you say there were basically four priorities.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.920]   And you start from the bottom and work your way up.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.680]   And at the bottom is your basic needs.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.720]   In other words, how much you need to live on.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.960]   And this is where the annuities could help,
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.600]   along with Social Security.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.520]   And then the next thing you have is called a contingency fund.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.360]   Now, a lot of people think of that as an emergency fund.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.040]   But I think the word contingency fund is actually
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.880]   probably a better word.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.720]   Your house could need a new roof.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.400]   That's not an emergency, but it is a contingency.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.240]   The next level is discretionary and then legacy.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.360]   So I like the way that you prioritize that.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.320]   Then you basically looked at this and said,
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.960]   this is how you have to think about your retirement.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   And you have to fill your basic needs bucket first
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.160]   with known income.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.800]   And then you have to have a contingency fund.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.840]   And then you could have your discretionary fund,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.800]   which might be filled more with equity,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.840]   and a legacy, which might be filled
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.560]   with equity and fixed income or real estate or something.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.880]   Am I getting that correct?
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.400]   Yeah, yeah, that's the idea.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.720]   Anyway, it's a contingency fund.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.680]   It's really for any of these spending shocks.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.560]   So in retirement, there can be a lot more health-related
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.920]   or long-term care and so forth.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.840]   So yeah, right, it's more than an emergency fund.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.360]   But yeah, that's the basic order of prioritizing and working
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.720]   your way up to your financial goals.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.840]   In your book, you talked about those liabilities
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.680]   of your basic needs and contingency and discretionary
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.120]   and legacy.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.840]   And you married them up against your assets.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.520]   So you did liability matching.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.840]   These assets would be used to match up
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.920]   against these liabilities.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.680]   Yeah, and that's an important part of the safety-first
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.240]   approach.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.320]   It's an asset liability matching problem.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.160]   The liabilities are just the expenses
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.400]   associated with your goals, which you are describing.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.160]   And I use the term 4Ls as well, the longevity, lifestyle,
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.000]   liquidity, and legacy, are your 4Ls,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.040]   longevity about your core expenses,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.240]   lifestyle about discretionary, liquidity for the contingencies,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.360]   and then legacy for legacy, of course.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.120]   Those are the liabilities associated with your goals.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:12.920]   And then positioning your assets to match to those goals
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.520]   with reliable income assets, so things like Social Security,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.800]   individual bonds, traditional pensions, and then annuities
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.640]   as well, potentially, and then diversified portfolio,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   and then reserve assets.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.840]   And so with this asset liability matching,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.760]   that's another thing where you can't double-count assets.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.120]   So reserve assets are just what you
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   have that's not already earmarked for something else.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.600]   And that's important in the context of retirement income,
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.200]   because if I believe in the 4% rule
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.600]   and I'm looking to spend $40,000 and I have a million dollars,
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.640]   so I put it in a brokerage account
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.040]   and put it in a 50/50 stock bond mix, do I have any liquidity?
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.400]   Technically, the answer is yes.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.600]   My brokerage account's liquid.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.200]   But in the meaningful sense of this retirement income problem,
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.320]   the answer is no.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.440]   The entire million dollars is earmarked for that $40,000
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.600]   spending goal.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.920]   And even though I could spend it on something else,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.600]   doing so directly jeopardizes that future spending goal.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.440]   And so the reserve assets are just
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.360]   what you still have available for contingencies that
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.320]   are not earmarked for one of your other three L's--
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.880]   your lifestyle, longevity, or legacy goals.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.760]   OK, well, now we're going to dig into all
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.360]   these different insurance products,
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.600]   because they can be very simple, and they
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.400]   can be very complicated.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.160]   And in your book, you go through them all.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.960]   And some of them, believe me, especially
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.760]   when I got to the variable annuity,
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.320]   it got to be extremely complicated.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.800]   And I don't know how anybody could keep
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.760]   this in their head difficult. But let's go ahead
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.720]   and move on to the different types of annuities,
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.560]   because you talk about them all in the book.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.280]   And there's the basic immediate annuity, deferred annuity,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.840]   getting into a whole life policy.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.920]   If you could go through the pluses
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.200]   and minuses of each one of these types of annuities,
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.520]   that would be great.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.880]   Yeah, so on the annuity side, the spectrum
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.240]   would be the simple income annuity,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.960]   so single premium immediate annuity,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.920]   or deferred income annuity.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   Those are fixed annuities.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.920]   They're on one side of the spectrum
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.360]   in terms of the most guaranteed income,
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.440]   but the least or no liquidity, and least or no--
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.960]   showing no upside exposure.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.760]   And then as you move along the spectrum from that end
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.000]   towards the other end, it's going to be the fixed index
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.440]   annuity and then the variable annuity.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.880]   So the fixed index annuity is in the middle,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.160]   where it is a fixed annuity, but it's deferred.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.520]   You haven't locked up your money with it in the sense
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.560]   that you still have access to the funds.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.440]   And they're generally based on some sort
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.600]   of a financial derivative strategy.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   That's where you can read about how
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.920]   people can create their own fixed index annuity return
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.800]   structures.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.440]   They can't create the mortality credits
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.800]   if you have a guaranteed living withdrawal benefit.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.840]   But it's generally, you have principal protection
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.680]   because the insurance company buys enough bonds
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.640]   to protect your principal.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.440]   And then with what's left over, they
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.120]   buy some call options to give you
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   some exposure to the upside.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.000]   It's like the very basic level of how they work.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.160]   So downside protection with some upside exposure
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.400]   and with a guaranteed living withdrawal benefit
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.880]   can provide that lifetime income.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.920]   And especially with the tax deferral,
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.800]   their returns could be competitive with a bond
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.200]   portfolio after taxes.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.680]   And then you've got moving along the variable annuity
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.480]   at the other end, which would generally then have
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.400]   the least downside protection.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.320]   You can have the guaranteed lifetime income,
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.040]   but it would generally be lower than what
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.520]   an income annuity or a fixed index annuity would provide.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   But the most upside potential with the ability
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.880]   to invest in an underlying asset allocation and sub-accounts
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.720]   that are not the same as mutual funds,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.800]   but they're the annuity equivalent of mutual funds.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.040]   And then also the liquidity as well,
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.400]   because it's a deferred annuity.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.280]   You still can tap into and get access to those funds
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.480]   if you wanted to get them back and take them out
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.800]   of the annuity.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.080]   So that's the spectrum.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.760]   Income annuity, fixed index annuity, variable annuity.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.080]   And where you end up on that spectrum
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.480]   really just depends on that trade-off
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.880]   between the most income in the worst-case scenario
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.560]   versus maybe less income in the worst-case scenario,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.080]   but the most potential for a higher income
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.400]   if markets end up doing well.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.080]   You recommend that if people are going
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.280]   to buy an immediate annuity, that they should first
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.040]   not take Social Security, delay Social Security.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.920]   Oh, yeah, yeah, that's an important point,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.960]   because step one of thinking about annuities
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.080]   is delay Social Security, because delaying--
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.240]   especially for the higher earner in the couple.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.720]   The spouse might start sooner.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.160]   Delaying Social Security age 70, the delay credits
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.800]   that you get from doing that were based on the situation
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.240]   in 1983, when people were not living as long,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.720]   when the assumed real interest rate was 2.9%
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   instead of the negative territory that it is now.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.640]   And so the implied benefit of delaying Social Security--
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.360]   if you think of if I delay Social Security,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.520]   the benefits I give up become a premium for at least
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.080]   the difference in benefits.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.320]   The benefit increase I get at 70,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.080]   that's a really high assumed payout rate,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.880]   much higher than any commercial annuity could provide.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.440]   And so it'd be really inefficient
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   to start Social Security at age 62,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.800]   and then also buy an annuity.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.480]   First, delay Social Security to 70,
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.520]   then figure out what's going to be your income gap
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.680]   at that point, and then think about the annuity from there.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.160]   I kind of think of it in many ways
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.480]   as if you're going to go buy an immediate annuity that you are
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.400]   trying to beat the pool, you're trying
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.720]   to be in the 50% that outlives the rest of the pool,
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.560]   that you have other people in the pool who
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.200]   are thinking the same thing.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.920]   They're healthy, and they think their longevity
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.520]   is going to beat the pool.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.920]   So everybody who's in that pool is, I think,
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:38.440]   probably more healthier than, say, the average person
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.120]   out there.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.960]   But that's not the case with Social Security.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.560]   I mean, everybody's in the pool.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   So if you're healthier, delaying seems to me
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   to be the best option.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely, right.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.160]   With annuities, there's adverse selection,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.400]   that those who have a feeling they're
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.240]   more likely to live longer are more likely to buy the annuity.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.800]   But right, Social Security is based
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.560]   on the aggregate US population.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.760]   And so to the extent--
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.800]   there's all these factors that are correlated with longevity.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.360]   Some people, because they have more of a long-term focus--
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.320]   and this is going to be a lot of bogey heads,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.920]   they're just higher education, higher income levels,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.440]   saving and accumulating more wealth--
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.920]   that ultimately, they're going to have a longer average
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.680]   lifetime than the average American.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.120]   So that's even speaking stronger to the idea
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.200]   of delaying Social Security, because your likelihood
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.360]   of living beyond the breakeven ages
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.280]   is all the more greater than the average person.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.320]   And generally, it's once you get past age 80,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.080]   you benefit from delaying Social Security.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.120]   And 80 is well below life expectancies
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.560]   for almost anyone who's going to be listening to a podcast
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.520]   about retirement income.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.160]   But I mean, there's going to be accidents or illnesses that
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.320]   happen randomly on occasion.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.920]   But the average person listening to this type of podcast
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.000]   will live dramatically longer than the average American.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.880]   And that's even a stronger case for delaying Social Security
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.760]   and for annuities.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.280]   You also talk about another type of insurance,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.000]   which is called whole life.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.560]   Normally, out there in the world,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.120]   it's stay away from whole life.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   But what you're saying, and you're
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.000]   making the argument that this could actually
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   be a good option for people.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.320]   Yeah, that's what I found in doing my simulations.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.560]   And just to be clear, I'm still a little bit
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.160]   young to be buying the annuities.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.880]   I anticipate doing that, but still in my early 40s.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.240]   But after doing this work on whole life insurance--
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.480]   and I am at the right age, so I found it so compelling--
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.840]   I did get myself a big whole life policy.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.000]   I know bogey heads generally don't like it.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.560]   But it's not about whole life versus the stock market.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.520]   This is about as a replacement for bonds.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.560]   If you just think about the cash value
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.280]   as an alternative for taxable bond investments,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.440]   it can be competitive in that regard.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.600]   But the simulations I do, they start
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.200]   at somebody who's still either 35 or 40 years old.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.080]   And they decide they need life insurance pre-retirement.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.200]   Then they think about, do they buy term and invest
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.760]   the difference?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.040]   Or do they buy whole life insurance, which
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.080]   is going to have a much higher premium
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.920]   and is going to reduce the amount they have
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.400]   in their investment accounts, but then lays
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.680]   the foundation for then having different strategies
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.480]   for retirement income and comparing, well,
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.960]   what sort of approach where I'm going
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.840]   to have a limited amount of savings each year
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.000]   and I can allocate that between investments, term insurance,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.840]   and whole life insurance?
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.640]   What can lay me the best foundation
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.800]   to get the most spending and legacy in retirement?
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.200]   And finding there were a number of different ways
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.080]   that whole life insurance can fit into that puzzle
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:54.440]   to support more income and/or more legacy in retirement.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.320]   And I found it compelling enough to actually begin
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.680]   implementing this for myself.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.720]   We just had the discussion about the annuity,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.400]   that the simple income annuity often
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.920]   has the most downside income.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.240]   And that's true, like a single life-only single premium
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.360]   immediate annuity would have the highest payout rate.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.440]   And then if you have two spouses with annuities,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.240]   the way you protect the spouse would be you get a joint life,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.600]   or you get a cash refund, or you keep
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   the liquidity for the underlying contract value and so forth.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.640]   And then that's your life insurance, in that case.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.760]   You get a lower guaranteed payout rate
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.480]   because you're building in more protection through the annuity.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.000]   And I compare that to, well, what
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.320]   if I just had the death benefit to back up the annuity premium?
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.720]   So in retirement, you could get a single life,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.240]   life-only income annuity backed by the life insurance.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.080]   And I found that that sort of approach
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.740]   could work much better than by term and a vested difference,
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.000]   and then doing systematic distributions,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.720]   or even by term and a vested difference,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.880]   and then by a joint life income annuity at retirement.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.240]   And then the other approach, it's
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.120]   really about the sequence of returns risk.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.720]   And it's this buffer asset, which I first really learned
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.560]   about on the reverse mortgage side.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.760]   But cash value life insurance is the other major example
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.040]   of a buffer asset.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.640]   It's this idea you have something
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.520]   outside your investment portfolio that's not
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.040]   correlated with the portfolio that
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   can be a temporary spending resource
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.640]   to help avoid having to sell assets when they're
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.240]   at a loss, or in trouble.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.560]   The rule that I found worked best
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.520]   is whenever your remaining investment assets are
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.000]   less than the amount they were at the start of retirement
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.440]   in nominal terms, draw from the buffer asset if you have it.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.840]   And that can really help manage sequence of returns risk
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.920]   and help to preserve the portfolio in a way
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.600]   that the gains in the portfolio can more than
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.720]   offset the fees associated with the buffer asset,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.600]   whether that's the expensive reverse mortgage,
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.160]   or whether that's the life insurance that has, of course,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.360]   the insurance fees, but you're getting the death
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.160]   benefit for that, but also just anything else related
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.600]   to the complexity of the contract
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.400]   and how that can lead to commissions or fees that
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.040]   are otherwise hard to tease out what exactly they are.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.600]   But looking at real policies, finding
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.680]   that you can support more spending and/or more legacy
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.640]   at the end of retirement as well with these more
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.760]   integrated strategies.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.000]   But it's the same idea again.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.560]   It's not that you're selling stocks to buy the insurance.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.600]   It's you're selling bonds to buy the insurance.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.320]   Try to keep the same amount of stocks,
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.520]   but you just position bonds so that they're not
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.560]   all held in bond funds.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.960]   They're also held in income annuities
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.520]   or in whole life insurance.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.400]   And I just found the results to be really compelling
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.920]   and tested many different variations on it.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.120]   I agree it's counterintuitive and surprising,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.560]   because I do come from the investments only world,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.560]   but I found it compelling enough to actually implement
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.680]   for myself.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.720]   So just a couple of clarifications.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.120]   When you're talking about your buffer assets,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.320]   you're talking about if you have a downturn in the market
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.680]   and you don't want to have to sell stock in order
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.360]   to take the money to live on, that you
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.720]   go to one of these buffer assets like the cash
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.920]   value in a whole life policy or like a reverse mortgage.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.440]   And that's where you get the money from in the year or two
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.160]   in which the markets are down.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.280]   And then when the markets come back up,
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.000]   then you can go back to selling stock.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.880]   And this is the concept of a buffer asset.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.360]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.480]   And that because sequence of returns risk
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.720]   works in such odd ways, the synergies
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.240]   of being able to avoid having to sell at a downturn or at a loss
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.400]   are really compelling and really then lead to a much better
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.400]   outcome for the portfolio.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.440]   In both cases with the reverse mortgage or the cash value,
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.480]   you're treating it as a loan.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.120]   The reverse mortgage, you're borrowing
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.280]   from the home equity and the cash value.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.240]   You structure it as a loan from the policy.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.160]   So there's going to be a loan balance that
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.960]   grows with interest.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.080]   But the benefits to protecting the portfolio
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.400]   can more than offset the costs of the growing loan
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.560]   balance associated with the buffer asset.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.440]   So yeah, that's the idea.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.320]   We're going to talk about reverse mortgages.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.680]   But I think that before we do that,
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.080]   we need to kind of clear up a couple of things.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.240]   And that is, I live in a retirement community
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.760]   in an over 55 community.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.240]   And I get these invitations to go to dinners
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.080]   where they're put on by retirement specialists
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.200]   talking about giving me guaranteed retirement
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.600]   income for life.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   So I went to one of these free chicken dinners.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.280]   I'll tell you, it was the biggest farce
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.040]   I've ever been to in my life.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.360]   The guy used all kinds of emotional things
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.760]   to try to get--
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.200]   particularly targeted the woman in the audience--
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.120]   to say, you're never going to see your grandchildren again
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.400]   if your husband dies unless you come and see me.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.840]   And I'm going to make sure you get the income that you get.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.680]   I mean, it was a real sleaze.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.120]   And this is sort of the impression
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.360]   that people get about insurance and insurance salespeople.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.640]   So all of this stuff gets lumped under, don't do it.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.680]   Don't go there.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.440]   It's just high commission garbage.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.880]   Yeah, and I mean, as a starting point default assumption,
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.600]   that's probably a good rule to live by.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.800]   Because as annuities get more complicated,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.160]   they're not transparent.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.800]   So that can allow costs to be internalized in ways
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.400]   that are not at all obvious.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.600]   I mean, so the starting point is the simple income annuity.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.560]   And just the reason all these more complicated annuities
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.320]   developed was because the simple income annuity is
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.560]   you pay the premium, and then that asset disappears
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   from your balance sheet.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.640]   But you now have this protected monthly paycheck
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.800]   for the rest of your lifetime.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.560]   People were not comfortable giving up that liquidity.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.680]   And then also, they were not comfortable with giving
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.600]   an upside for that asset once you have the income annuity.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.280]   You can't strike it big in the stock market and so forth.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.880]   And so that's where these other types of annuities developed.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.640]   And these are deferred variable annuities or fixed index
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.720]   annuities.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.680]   And I think a lot of those chicken dinner type
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.080]   events are going to be for the fixed index annuities, where
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.000]   they might even portray them as get
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.280]   the returns of the stock market without the risk.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.800]   And that, to be clear, is also not how they work.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.720]   But it's easy to get misled about that.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.880]   But at a basic level-- and so the idea
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.400]   is there can be good competitively priced versions
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:45.880]   of those.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.340]   That's not necessarily what you're
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.080]   getting at one of the chicken dinner events.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.440]   But it's a way to still have the liquidity.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.440]   You don't have to annuitize the contract.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.120]   So you can still get your money back.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.160]   Now, there could be surrender charges and things.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.560]   But you still have access to the funds.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.960]   And then you still have some degree of upside exposure.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.000]   And the variable annuity usually would provide more upside
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.200]   exposure than a fixed index annuity.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.320]   But you have the underlying contract value.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.800]   You have the upside exposure.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.840]   And then you have this optional rider
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.040]   that really was developed just in the 1990s initially,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.720]   this guaranteed living withdrawal benefit
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.400]   that will provide you that guaranteed lifetime income.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.120]   And you're spending your own money
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.200]   as long as there's money left in the contract.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.920]   But the idea is if the contract depletes,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.120]   that's when the rider kicks in.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.760]   And you'll continue to receive that guaranteed income
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.040]   for the rest of your life.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.360]   So it works as a source of guaranteed lifetime income.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.000]   But the companies have just made these things so complex.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.520]   And every company uses different terminology.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.440]   And especially with the variable annuities,
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.200]   they have the guaranteed roll-up rates
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.040]   that people misunderstand to mean
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.360]   a guaranteed rate of return.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.520]   And so the point of those two chapters in the Safety First
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.880]   book was to just try to step back and describe
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.360]   how the annuities work.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.160]   So that if somebody is thinking about them,
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.720]   they at least know the basic underlying structure
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.000]   and know what questions to ask and know
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.600]   what they need to understand to determine
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.480]   if that's the right type of product for their situation.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.400]   But yeah, I mean, otherwise, the default
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.080]   is you do want to be quite cautious.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.480]   To me, the transparency of, say, an index mutual fund--
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.320]   here's the fee.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.520]   Here's what you get.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.160]   Here's the performance of the index.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.580]   Here's the performance of the fund.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.960]   It's very clear.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.160]   Even if you're doing a treasury bond, here's the interest.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.920]   This is what you're going to get.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.960]   Here's the bond.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.120]   If you go to a bank and you buy a CD,
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.600]   this is the annual percentage rate that you're going to get.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.920]   This is for how long.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   If you turn it in early, there's a penalty.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.080]   And it's all very simple and very clear.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.440]   And a lot of people can figure it out on their own.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.320]   And they'll end up buying index funds and CDs
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.840]   and keeping it simple.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.600]   But when it comes to insurance, boy,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.320]   things can get really messy.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.720]   I mean, how do you know you're working
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.600]   with an agent who actually cares about you?
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.480]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.920]   And since I'm not actually involved in selling insurance,
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.520]   these kinds of more practical issues--
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.440]   it's a good question that I don't necessarily
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.000]   have a good answer for.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.280]   Because you can't just go by on who has the nicest personality
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.480]   or who's a member of your church and so forth.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.760]   Because a lot of people can use these types
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:42.960]   of civic organizations to gain trust in inappropriate ways.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.200]   So yeah, I mean, I don't have a good answer.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   I think you probably want to just do more--
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.280]   especially like bogleheads who are
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.760]   more involved in this process-- do
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.640]   the research about the actual annuity products themselves,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.840]   figure out what annuity is right for you,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.640]   and then just, as necessary, use an agent to get what you want,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.440]   rather than having to rely on that agent to give you
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.120]   the proposals about what they want to sell you, I guess,
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.760]   would be the real starting point with that.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.280]   But do you see why there's kind of an aversion
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.160]   to doing the whole concept of the safety first?
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.060]   Not that it wouldn't work.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.400]   It all sounds good, and I'm sure that there are good companies
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.320]   out there to do it.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.960]   It's a question of how does an individual actually
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.720]   go out and decipher which are the good people to work with,
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.520]   and whoever's out there selling chicken dinners trying
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.520]   to capture a 10% commission and on to the next person?
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.360]   Makes it very difficult to, say, adopt
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.320]   your strategy, which probably should
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.480]   be adopted by more people.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.800]   The question is the process of how you actually ferret out
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.720]   all this stuff out there and actually come up
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.680]   with what is the way in which you do this.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   Yeah, and probably staying away from those chicken dinners
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.920]   is another sound bit of advice.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.880]   But increasingly, the annuities are now
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.800]   being offered on a fee-only basis, where
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   they don't pay commissions.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.400]   And so the traditional financial advisors
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.640]   who don't accept commissions and who just charge
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.440]   a fee from their clients to provide the advice
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.000]   are able to offer annuities to their clients as well.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.040]   And with the fee-only version, since it
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.600]   doesn't bake in a commission, it can have lower fees
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.080]   and also even perhaps not have surrender charges,
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.200]   or at least have dramatically lowered surrender charges
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.440]   as well.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.480]   But yeah, your point's valid that it's
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.720]   hard to know who you can trust in the world of annuity
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.520]   purchasing.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.120]   Let's talk about another buffer asset
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.440]   that you mentioned a few times now called a reverse mortgage,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.040]   which you wrote a book about.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.360]   In fact, it was your first book.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.400]   You wrote it in 2016.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.760]   Some of the rules and regulations
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.520]   have changed since the book has come out.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.880]   So could you go over reverse mortgages
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.760]   and how reverse mortgages could work
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.840]   into this whole retirement plan?
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.360]   Right.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.720]   So it's another tool that you can
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.920]   have as part of the toolkit.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.520]   And indeed, as people are starting
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.400]   to really figure out the value of reverse mortgages,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.600]   and it was possible to set one up for $125
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.400]   in some circumstances, in August 2017,
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.840]   there was a rule change introduced
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.440]   that got implemented October 1, 2017, that effectively,
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.640]   by increasing the initial mortgage insurance premiums,
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.600]   raised the initial cost of setting up a reverse mortgage
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.000]   quite dramatically.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.320]   I wasn't planning to do it, but I
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.440]   had to write a second edition of my book
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.800]   to redo all the analysis under the new rules.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.920]   Found the new rules did weaken the case for reverse mortgage,
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.560]   but didn't completely overturn it.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.840]   So the second edition of my book accounts for today's rules.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.280]   And it's the same idea.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.400]   If you can be strategic, and you open the reverse mortgage,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.320]   and then use it strategically alongside the investment
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.960]   portfolio, in any number of ways,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.400]   it can help lay a foundation for a better retirement outcome
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.640]   in terms of either supporting more spending
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.080]   and/or the same spending, but having more legacy
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.600]   at the end of retirement as well.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.320]   Where legacy in that case would be
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.200]   what's left in your investments plus the value of your home
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.400]   minus the loan balance due on the reverse mortgage,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.800]   where it's the buffer asset, same as we were just talking
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.280]   about with life insurance, that you have the reverse mortgage
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.680]   line of credit, and it's growing over time,
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.640]   and it can't be canceled or frozen.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.280]   And then rather than having to sell from your portfolio
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.960]   at a loss in a troubling time, you
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.200]   could tap into the reverse mortgage as a source of funds.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.840]   Again, it proceeds from a loan, so it's not taxable income.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.960]   It doesn't show up as part of your adjusted gross income.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.560]   And it can provide that bridge for spending.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.520]   You could also just set it up as a contingency fund
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.000]   as a way to have liquid contingency assets
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.400]   for any sort of spending shock.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.600]   So there's a lot of ways reverse mortgages can be used.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.200]   Wait, a lot of these ideas seem to make sense.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.480]   What stops people from doing it?
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.640]   In terms of annuities, there's this whole academic literature
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.880]   about the annuity puzzle, just trying
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.760]   to explain why people are not comfortable with annuities,
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.720]   and that we've talked already about the lack of liquidity
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.360]   and upside potential in a traditional income annuity.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.640]   Another thing is just people, they view it as the gamble,
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.600]   like we discussed, that if I buy the annuity
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.560]   and then I die early, the insurance company
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.280]   wins at my expense.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.240]   And people aren't always comfortable with that.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.280]   That's not strictly how the annuity works.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.200]   It's a long-lived in the risk pool
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.760]   that win at your expense rather than the insurance company.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.480]   But that can certainly be an impediment.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   And so there are things as well like charitable gift annuities
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.560]   where you can--
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.120]   usually the payout rate would be less
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.920]   with a charitable gift annuity because it's
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.520]   trying to build in something for the charity.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.360]   But in that case, you can frame it more as, well,
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.120]   the charity would win at my expense
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.240]   rather than the insurance company.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.280]   So that can be a potential solution to that annuity
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.480]   puzzle.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   Could you explain what a charitable gift annuity is?
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.440]   It's a way for charities to receive charitable contributions
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.960]   from individuals, but to link that as well to a lifetime
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.440]   income.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.640]   Now, charities have different approaches.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.560]   The safest approach for the charity is they take your gift
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.240]   and they purchase from a commercial insurer
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.400]   an annuity for you to pay you.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.440]   But because they're offering a lower payout rate
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.720]   than a commercial annuity, they're
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.240]   able to then keep part of that as a gift.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.440]   The riskier way for a charity to manage that
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.600]   would be to actually become an insurer themselves, so to speak,
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.480]   and to pay out the annuities through the collections
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.840]   that they receive.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.480]   But either way, the idea is they're
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.560]   paying below market rates as annuities.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.960]   And therefore, on average, are able to receive
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.120]   a charitable contribution so that people
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.120]   can make that gift sooner, but still receive a lifetime
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.240]   income connected to it.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.000]   So that they can also be thinking of it
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.720]   as it's like a way to mix their retirement
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.440]   spending and their charitable giving together
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.560]   into one overall strategy rather than keeping them separate.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.320]   How do the taxes work on that?
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.040]   In other words, you give a gift to charity
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.520]   and they buy you an annuity.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.840]   I mean, how much of a deduction do you get on the gift?
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.200]   And how much do you have to pay in taxes on the income
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.400]   that you get from the annuity?
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.640]   Well, you're not going to necessarily get the full tax
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.840]   deduction right away.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.520]   You probably do want to indeed talk to a CPA
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.560]   to make sure that you're getting all those specifics right.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.840]   Because indeed, part of a charitable gift annuity payment
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.440]   can be taxable income.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.240]   And as we talk as well about this annuity puzzle
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.120]   and kind of why don't people seem to like annuities,
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.720]   another idea that's been offered is
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.880]   it's been called the Scrooge McDuck effect.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.480]   Yeah, from the old cartoons.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.920]   He loved to jump into his money bin
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.240]   and swim through his money.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.840]   And it was like people want to see their money.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.000]   They may not have a money bin like Scrooge McDuck.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.800]   But when they look at their portfolio statement,
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   if they see a lot of funds, they feel wealthier.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.280]   And if you purchase an income annuity,
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.800]   you can lose that phenomenon.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.760]   The annuity has a present value of its lifetime future payments.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.560]   And that can be substantial.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.040]   But that's not usually reported anywhere.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.720]   And so people may feel poorer after purchasing an income
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.600]   annuity.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.280]   Because instead of having this pot of assets to look at,
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.800]   they do have a valuable asset.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.440]   They just don't get to see it.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.560]   And they don't appreciate it as much for that reason.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.200]   Let's jump into one topic that you
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.000]   talk about a lot that is not insurance related.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.320]   And that is using tips in a portfolio.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.800]   Well, so interest rates are very low now.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.640]   But that's true across the board.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.680]   If you're going to hold bonds in retirement,
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.040]   I think the case for tips would be much stronger
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.400]   than for traditional treasuries.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.480]   But at the end of the day, I don't just
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.640]   simply know how many different types of bond
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   holdings a retiree needs.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.840]   I would lean more towards using that income annuity approach
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.560]   instead.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.480]   But yeah, I mean, if you want inflation protection,
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.280]   tips and I-bonds are the bonds that can provide that to you.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.360]   Let's end with what you call the Retirement Research Manifesto,
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.280]   where you have eight points.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.240]   You put this in the beginning of all your books.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.760]   And I just want to go through them with you.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.000]   And comment quickly on each one.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.040]   The first one is play the long game.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.880]   You occasionally hear somebody say,
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.640]   oh, I don't need a retirement plan.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.640]   I'm going to be dead by 70.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.280]   And that's not really the way to think about retirement
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:55.760]   planning.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.520]   You've got to assume you're going to live a long time.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:03.240]   That's the foundation of how we mostly think about retirement.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.480]   But it's just important to have that reminder.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.960]   Number two, don't leave money on the table.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.840]   The idea there is to just be efficient with your planning.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.920]   And there's so many parts of retirement income
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.320]   where a small short-term expense can
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.280]   lead to a big long-term benefit.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.840]   And that's what I mean about not leaving money
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.240]   on the table in that regard.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.400]   Use reasonable expectations for portfolio returns.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.200]   I think that one's really important.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.160]   A lot of financial planning software
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.160]   just plugging in historical averages for everything,
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.480]   assuming bonds are going to average 5% or 6% returns when
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.760]   we see interest rates in the neighborhood of 1%.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.880]   You've got to be realistic, and especially with sequence risk.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.680]   Which leads into number four, be careful about plans that only
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.040]   work with high market returns.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.720]   So much of the simple stuff you'll see online
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.440]   is assume an 8% rate of return, and this or that happens.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.560]   And sure, it's easy to fund retirement with 8% returns.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.440]   But the probability of getting those
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.400]   is not necessarily all that high.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.960]   You've got to make sure you have a plan that can work,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.280]   even if you don't get 8% returns.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.160]   And that leads us to what we talked about today, number 5,
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.680]   build an integrated strategy to manage various retirement
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.320]   risks.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.720]   Bonds are a starting point.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.600]   And the way to try to spend more than just a simple bond
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.520]   portfolio, you have the diversified stock portfolio,
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.400]   aggressive portfolio, and get risk premium
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.440]   from the stock market.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.080]   Or you use an insurance approach and get risk pooling.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.480]   And either way, you have the potential to spend more,
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.920]   and they can manage these different risks, the longevity,
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.360]   the market risk, and the spending
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.960]   shocks in different ways.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.040]   So integrating tools together is important.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.560]   And number 6 is the reason I wanted you on the call today,
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.640]   because of what's going on in the financial markets
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.520]   with very low, historic low interest rates,
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.360]   negative interest rates all over the world.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.860]   Approach retirement income tools with an agnostic view.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:13.000]   Yeah, that's the important one, because if you
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.880]   come from a particular area, you think
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.680]   that's the solution for everything,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.440]   whether it's investments, whether it's insurance.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.160]   Even people who think that reverse mortgages are
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.480]   the solution for everything.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.680]   And at the end of the day, just keep an open mind
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.080]   about any sort of tool.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.200]   Think about how it can contribute to your plan.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.720]   And think about things that way.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.320]   Don't just exclude things without a deeper investigation.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.080]   Number 7, start by assessing all retirement assets
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.480]   and liabilities.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.360]   The retirement balance sheet, it's
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.360]   about asset liability matching.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.060]   And so you figure out your goals.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.720]   They lead to your liabilities or expenses.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.200]   And then you map your assets to those goals.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.280]   And you try to match up the risk characteristics.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.600]   So you don't want a lot of stock market investments
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.760]   for your basic expenses, that sort of thing.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.600]   But you need to think about the whole picture,
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.960]   about matching assets to liabilities.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.800]   And finally, distinguish between technical liquidity
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.240]   and true liquidity.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.720]   An investment portfolio can be technically liquid,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.480]   but with asset liability matching.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.160]   If I believe in the 4% rule, and I have $1 million,
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:30.120]   and I want to fund $40,000, that money, though technically
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.400]   liquid, is not true liquidity.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.120]   It's earmarked to meet my future spending.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.320]   True liquidity is when you have assets that are not
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.520]   earmarked for something else.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.760]   And then they became the source of reserves
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.680]   that can fund your contingencies in retirement.
