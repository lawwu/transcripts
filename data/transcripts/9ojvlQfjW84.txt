[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Well, did Jesus celebrate polygamy? It's an interesting question from a listener named
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.520]   Amy. "Hello, Pastor John. I know you have opposed polygamy on the podcast in episode
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.040]   860, but I'm curious, if Jesus was so opposed to it, why did he use the parable of the 10
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.520]   virgins in Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13? Why would Jesus use this parable if taking multiple
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.200]   wives was immoral?" Pastor John, what would you say to Amy? Let's read the parable. "Then
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.680]   the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.440]   bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, five were wise. For when the foolish took their
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.040]   As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.560]   a cry, 'Here's the bridegroom, come out to meet him.' Then all those virgins rose
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.840]   and trimmed their lamps, and the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.140]   for our lamps are going out.' But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.080]   enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' And while
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.800]   they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.360]   to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   'Lord, Lord, open to us.' But he answered, 'Julie, I say to you, I do not know you.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.940]   Watch therefore,'" this is Jesus' application, "'watch therefore, for you know neither
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.160]   the day nor the hour,'" meaning the day or the hour of the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.080]   Now Amy asks, if Jesus was opposed to polygamy, why did he use the parable of the ten virgins?
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.960]   And I assume Amy asked this question because she thinks the ten virgins are waiting to
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.040]   marry the bridegroom when he comes. And perhaps she's encouraged in that interpretation because
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   another bride is never mentioned in the parable. The bride is never mentioned. But that assumption
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.840]   that Amy seems to be making is not necessary or even likely, as Amy herself seems to imply.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.900]   First because Jesus is clear on what he thinks marriage is. It's rooted in God's design
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.120]   with Adam and Eve in Genesis 2. And so he says in Matthew 19, "For have you not read,"
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.600]   and he's referring back there to that Genesis passage, "Have you not read that he who created
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.920]   them from the beginning made them male and female and said, 'Therefore a man shall,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.200]   a man, one man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and the
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:13.440]   two," not ten, "two shall become one flesh." So it's much more likely that we should see
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.920]   these ten virgins as what we would call bridesmaids. We don't know the details of how they did
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.760]   weddings among the Jews in those days, but it's easy to imagine that the bride is in
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:38.900]   the house waiting at the feast in private, not seen yet, and the bridesmaids, their job
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.620]   is supposed to run out to the bridegroom and bring him in with a great feast to where the
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.280]   bride is waiting.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.160]   So here's a good principle to learn about parables at this point. Beware of letting
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.040]   imaginary details of parables—and that's what parables are, they're imaginary—take
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.480]   on meaning which would contradict the clear teaching of Jesus elsewhere. Parables are
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.840]   not that sort of teaching. They are verbal pictures to make a point, but not every brush
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   stroke in the picture is designed to make a separate point.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.000]   And let me illustrate from this very parable, this principle that I think is valuable here.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.500]   It ends with a pretty clear statement of application. Jesus says, "Therefore," so I've just told
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.160]   you this story, now here's the "therefore." "Therefore, watch, for you know neither
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.280]   the day nor the hour." So he's comparing the coming of Jesus the second time to the
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.560]   coming of the bridegroom at night, and they didn't know what time he was going to come.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.160]   He says, "Therefore, watch, for you know neither the day nor the hour." So the point
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:03.400]   we are to take away from five foolish virgins whose oil ran out, and five wise virgins who
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:11.640]   took thought to be ready with extra oil, was, "Watch, so that the Lord's second coming
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:19.600]   doesn't take you off guard like that." But what does "watch" mean? All ten were
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:27.160]   sleeping! All ten! The wise virgins were sleeping. They're not criticized for it. All ten were
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   sleeping. If you think "watching" means going to your window and looking into the
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.320]   sky for the imminent coming of Jesus, you're not getting what "watch" means here. Including
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.120]   these wise virgins who are sleeping. They are successfully watching. So what does "watch"
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.920]   mean? They're wise. They're watching where they're supposed to. It doesn't mean stay
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:56.840]   up all night. No, it means stay awake to your calling. Stay awake to your duty. Stay awake
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.720]   to the vigilance you should have spiritually in your life. "Watch" doesn't mean don't
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.600]   sleep. It means don't fail to avail yourself of all the spiritual resources you will need
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.500]   to persevere in your calling and your duty till Jesus comes. So he finds you doing your
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.920]   duty, which means running out to meeting when he comes, having done your duty. So in the
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.960]   parable the duty was, "Honor the bridegroom with a great welcome and bring him into the
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:32.540]   celebration so that he can eat with his wife." It didn't matter if you slept, provided that
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.980]   you had all the resources you need to wake up and be there doing what you're supposed
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:46.760]   to do. So when it says at the end, "Watch," the watchfulness is spiritual life, vitality,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.960]   readiness, vigilance, care. So the parable is not about polygamy or monogamy. It's not
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.020]   even about marriage. It's about what it means to live in the light of the second coming
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:11.480]   with spiritual wakefulness and vitality, always ready to be found doing what our duty is when
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.480]   he comes.

[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.160]   Great takeaway on eschatological wakefulness. Thank you, Pastor John. So good. And we did,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.720]   in fact, talk about polygamy in a past episode, in episode 860, number 860, which is titled,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.880]   "May I Have Two Wives, Six Vidos." That's the title. And that's one of our 1,300, over
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.800]   now 1,300 total episodes to date. Thank you for your interest and questions over the past
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.160]   six years. You can search all those episodes and read full transcripts that are online
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.320]   at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   Speaking of follow-up questions, our episode on fantasy sports gambling recently brought
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.000]   in a few of those questions as well. Specifically, isn't educated sports gambling as virtuous
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.040]   as playing the stock market? We'll talk financial risk-taking when we return on Monday. I'm
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.160]   Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening and have a great weekend.
