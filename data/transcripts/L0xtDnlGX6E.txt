[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   So I think that there's a variety of different value props and reasons
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.240]   why people seem to care about it.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.840]   One is the fact that it's not just one model nowadays, but it's
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.400]   sort of this ecosystem of models.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.920]   So we see this really incredible outpouring of, of these great models
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.280]   from wizard to Falcon to, you know, all of the Lama variants and things like this.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.000]   And people want to be able to access these models and they might not always
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.680]   be, you know, technically capable of doing it, they might not have
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.360]   computational resources to do it.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.240]   And so part of the GPT for all initiative has really been collecting these models
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.880]   that industries are creating and in groups are creating that are open source
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.680]   and compressing them so that people can run them, you know, on device and sort
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.560]   of providing them this easy to use launcher so that even if you are not
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.540]   comfortable on a command line, you can go to the website, double click a thing,
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.920]   and then get up and running with an open source language model.
