[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   The following is a short clip from a sermon on Hebrews chapter 7 verse 25
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.160]   about the ongoing intercession of Christ on our behalf. In it, John Piper reminds
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.800]   us of our greatest problem and of our greatest hope. Here's what he said. "From
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   what am I being saved? Now the reason I start with this is because in our
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.120]   culture, which is increasingly a post-Christian culture, you can't assume
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   that the word 'saved' 'are you saved' means anything to anybody or that the word
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.960]   'salvation' means anything. They might fill those words up with meaning totally
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.240]   contrary to the Bible and so we have to get at least our heads and our hearts
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.200]   straight on this matter of what we are being saved from. Now let me pose the
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.960]   question for you. Don't jump around to other parts of the Bible, just stay right
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.840]   here with this verse. If I say my ongoing salvation depends on Christ's ongoing
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.400]   intercessory work for me with the Father, what do I need saving from? The Father, God.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.360]   Else I would not need an intercessor. Intercessors interpose themselves to
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.640]   help fix something that isn't fixed or to keep something fixed that is fixed.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.560]   The big issue is God's wrath. Now let's just get this real clear and real
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.800]   straight because I have the feeling we live in such a kind of touchy-feely day
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.640]   that Christianity is being so psychologized and so therapeutized that
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.920]   we really do believe this book was written for our mental health. It wasn't.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.840]   It was written to help us get right with a wrathful God. God is one great massive
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:22.080]   fire of holiness. He hates sin and cannot abide it. We are little ant-like
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   sinners of sin and if we got within 10 trillion miles of this God, we'd be
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.000]   consumed. The problem in the universe is not our fragile marriages. The problem in
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.960]   the universe is not my failing health. The problem in the universe is not my
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.800]   wayward children. The problem in the universe is not the conflicts at work.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.560]   The problem that the Bible was written to deal with is I have no hope of
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   drawing near to God without being consumed because I'm a sinner and unless
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.440]   there is some kind of priest who can wrap me around with all he is and take
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.760]   me into the center of this fire, there's no hope for me at all. That's what the
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.000]   Bible is about. Now there are some spin-offs for our mental health and our
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.880]   marriages and our kids and our jobs but those are just spin-offs folks and if
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.800]   everything went wrong and this got right, you would leap for joy forever and ever
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:46.320]   and ever because God is the main issue. Life is very short. Sin is very horrid.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:55.000]   Salvation is so needy. So key. We need this reminder over and over again. This was
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   John Piper in his sermon "Jesus from Melchizedek to Eternal Savior" preached
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.740]   on December 1, 1996. The excerpt was recommended from podcast listener
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.600]   Michael Mitchell from Nashville, Tennessee. Thank you Michael for this
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.440]   clip. You can download the full message and over 1,200 others from our website

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.440]   Pastor John and he will explain one incredible way the local church trumps
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.800]   Twitter and Facebook. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
