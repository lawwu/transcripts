[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Every day is not a Friday, but today is a Friday.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And yesterday we talked about podcast preachers and how prominent preachers affect our evaluation of pastors in our local churches.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   One way to appreciate your local church pastor is simply to let him know that you appreciate him.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And Pastor John, when you were a pastor, what things most encouraged you?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   When you think back on the pictures drawn by kids in the church or the phone calls from folks thanking you or encouraging notes that you got in the mail,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   what as a pastor, what things most encouraged you?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   To go to the hospital and find a young couple holding a dead baby and trusting God.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I don't want to minimize, Tony, the preciousness of notes and phone calls.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Every one of us needs that kind of affirmation.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Sam Crabtree, my precious partner for goodness, 20 years or so, wrote a book.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I'm glad he wrote the book on affirmation.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And Sam's good at it, and I needed it from him because he makes the case.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   There's a God-centered way of recognizing the grace of God in people's lives and pointing it out to God's glory and also for their encouragement.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I want to believe that God is using me in the ministry.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Often the devil whispers, "You're wasting your time," or, "You're just a vain prig anyway, and all you want is the approval of men."
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And I need sober statements from people about blessings that have come to their lives through what I've written or what I've said or what I did.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But I'm just saying yes to that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Yes, amen.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Do that for your pastor.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Do it more than you think he needs it.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   He probably doesn't get too much of that.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   But what will make a pastor most deeply thrilled is when he sees the truth of a life of faith that he's been teaching for years actually lived out.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   When he sees his people doing the hard thing.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   When I look at a group of people on Tuesday night going to Nicollet Avenue and bearing witness to Jesus boldly in evangelism, I say, "Yes, Lord, yes!"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The spillover is happening.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's happening.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   People are testifying to the truth of what they've come to love at Bethlehem, and they're going out and they're saying it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So seeing the actual lived outness of that.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And to go back where I started, to watch people suffer well.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I mean, a huge part of my ministry is to take the teachings of 1 Peter where he says, "Brothers, do not think that something unusual is happening to you when you endure fiery trial."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And I think most Americans do feel like something unusual is happening to us if we walk through fire.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I've devoted a lot of my ministry to try to help people say, "It's not unusual.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's coming.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It will be your father's love, not your father's opposition when it comes.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Trust him, even if you can't explain the details of it."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And when I watch people respond that way to suffering, I feel like I have not wasted my life.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So, yes, write the notes, make the phone calls, point out evidences of grace in your pastor's life.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And the usefulness that God has made him to you.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And then devote most of your energies to becoming the kind of person that he's been preaching for you to be.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Wonderful.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We will be back on Monday with a new episode.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And Selection Sunday is this weekend.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Some of you know what I'm talking about.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I can hear the madness creeping its way into March now.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Pastor John, on Tuesday, we will talk about basketball and March madness.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And trust me, you will not want to miss this epic episode, which also happens to be episode number 300 in the Ask Pastor John podcast series.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Epic, I think, is the word.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   [End of session]
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   [End of session]
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   [End of session]
