[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.100]   - All right, thanks Shane.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.920]   All right, how are we doing here?
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.420]   How many total questions we're gonna try to do today?
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.040]   - We have two more questions,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.080]   two or three more questions
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.400]   depending on what you're feeling.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.040]   - All right, well, let's do one more
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.560]   and then we might check in with our sponsors
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.400]   and do another.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.360]   - Okay, so the next question is from,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.160]   it's about lifestyle planning
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.080]   and there's some struggles to stay disciplined.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.320]   So we'll hear what it says.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.280]   - Hi Cal, this is Ina and besides being a homemaker,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.200]   I learn languages autonomously
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.400]   and I have my own language school.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.440]   My question has to do with rituals and motivation.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.680]   I have done life-centric career planning as you recommend
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.280]   and truly believe that at least
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.800]   for the current season of my life,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.320]   I have chosen adequate goals towards the future I desire.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.360]   Nevertheless, I find that some days
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.820]   I really do struggle to stay disciplined
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.600]   and to show up in the morning and get to work.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.480]   Thinking back on advice you've given on this podcast,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.120]   there are at least two ways I can approach this.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.000]   One is to automate the process with a specific when,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.600]   what, where and how
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.160]   so that I can let the power of habit take control
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.700]   and the other is to seek a variety of awe-inspiring places
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480]   to keep my brain interested and to jog my memory
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.920]   about why this work is important in the first place.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.840]   Which of these options would you suggest
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.320]   for someone who still has to periodically
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.500]   drag herself to her desk?
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.760]   - That's a good question, Ina.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.880]   So I think there's a few things that are relevant here
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.560]   and you hit on some of them.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520]   So my answer is gonna overlap pretty strongly
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.160]   with what you were just saying.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.560]   Automation is key
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.060]   and automation can mean multiple different things
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.900]   in this context.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.200]   So as you hinted, automation could just mean
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.580]   this is when, where and how I do this work.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.900]   So I don't even have to think about it,
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.580]   I get back from the gym
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.700]   and then we have a desk put aside for bills.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.000]   And that is when I do it, right after the gym on Wednesdays
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.680]   and that's when I do the bills.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.520]   And you know what?
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.120]   I always collect the bills from the mail
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.440]   and put them in a two process sorter on that desk
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.680]   so I know where they are.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.520]   And you know what?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.480]   I have stamps there and the envelopes there
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.080]   so it's real easy to do.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.280]   There is an actual boost you get from organization
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.640]   where you say I built out a system for this.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.580]   It's kind of fun to execute a system
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.600]   and see everything was here and it works really well
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.340]   and then you're more likely to actually do the work.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.140]   So you have that type of automation.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.260]   The other type of automation is literally automating it.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.540]   You're not gonna have someone else do this.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.260]   Especially when it comes to work, household admin work.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.380]   I think Laura Vanderkam has a good book about this,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.940]   "162 Hours" and she's a big advocate for this
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.620]   of to the extent that you can afford it,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.620]   this is where you should be putting a lot of your money
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.480]   is towards automating stuff in the house,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.360]   getting household admin off of your plate.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.760]   You have someone who does laundry,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.940]   someone who does your yard work,
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.400]   the handyman who comes once a month
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.560]   and you have this list that grows
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.640]   and he just takes it and does those things around the house.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   And her point, which I think is a good one,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.520]   is that is a super high return investment in money.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.000]   And what happens instead is people often say,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.680]   well, I technically could do these things
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.020]   so I'd rather spend that money on, you know,
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.580]   something more fleeting or superficial.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.240]   And it's actually what it got a lot more return
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.200]   in your life just to take those things off your plate.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.080]   So literal automation, I think,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.240]   is a priority to the extent that you could do it.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.340]   The second thing to do here is reduction.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.140]   So just taking things off your plate.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.680]   Sometimes when you're not able to get started on things
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.240]   it's because you're overloaded, there's too much,
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.440]   your mind is exhausted, it knows it's not sustainable.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.240]   So I'm not gonna do this, I'm sorry,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.800]   I'm not gonna help on that committee.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.600]   This is a bridge too far with like my exercise routine,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.160]   whatever it is, reduction.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.400]   So when your load is reasonable, it's easier to execute
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.600]   because you're playing with your wiring here.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   Your brain is very good at the things important,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   let's set a plan, let's execute that plan,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   let's feel really good because we got the plan done.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.160]   If you overload that part of your brain,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.200]   it short circuits and you lose all of that
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.040]   evolutionarily optimized inducements
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.560]   to actually do the daily work that's important.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.160]   We are wired to do daily stuff that's important
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.080]   for the survival of us and our families, right?
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.840]   So let's take advantage of those mechanisms,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.600]   but you can't take advantage of those mechanisms
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.320]   if there's 75 things on your list.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.120]   And then clarity would be my final suggestion
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.040]   and that is something you touched on before.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.240]   Here's my vision, lifestyle-centric career planning,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.660]   where we wanna be in five years,
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.800]   where we wanna be in 10 years,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920]   where we wanna be later this year.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.000]   This is how everything fits in,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.640]   these type of more mundane chores,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.220]   we've really automated and structured
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.480]   and there's these other things I'm doing
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.200]   that's really fulfilling and we're saving up to do this.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.360]   You have this vision that this is all a part of that,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.680]   you mentioned that as being important,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   you are right that that is important.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.280]   You are building towards a vision
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.600]   that you believe in and think is important.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.960]   You're working backwards from that positive goal,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.160]   it's very important to keep things moving.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.080]   So if you have kids, for example,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.700]   there's a couple natural milestones to think about.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.360]   There's a sort of young kid period,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.960]   which is sort of a survival mode.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.480]   There's a steady state period
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.720]   where you have grammar school aged kids
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.080]   and what you want life to be like there,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.120]   time with them, the role of work, where you live,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.360]   really thinking through what that experience is like,
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.640]   you have a really clear vision for,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.840]   okay, when does the last kid leave the house?
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   These are the changes that are happening then,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.560]   I think it's a great time to have
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.040]   a more substantial change to your lifestyle.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.360]   So you have these very clear visions
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.840]   that you're working backwards from,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.560]   that you're working towards with your day-to-day efforts.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.400]   And that, again, you're very right to point that out.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.840]   So automate, reduce, clarify.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.480]   Do those three things,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.680]   that's what's needed to keep making progress
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.560]   in a disciplined fashion on the stuff that's annoying,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.240]   but has to get done.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.160]   That's how you avoid just being paralyzed
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.440]   by exhaustion and indecision and lack of motivation.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.080]   (upbeat music)
