[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Does profanity and crude talk make us more relatable and effective in our engagement
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.420]   with the culture around us?
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.640]   The question comes in a lot in the inbox, and this time it arrives in the form of an
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.080]   email from a podcast listener named Eden.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.920]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm a freshman at a Bible college and a trend is sweeping the
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.960]   campus.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.960]   That is profanity.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.680]   I have never been under the impression that it is okay for Christians to cuss, but many
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.960]   students here justify their language as a means to engage in the world.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.060]   Is there scripture that supports this idea?
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.840]   Is it okay for a Christian to use crude language to gain the ear of non-Christians?"
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.600]   Pastor John, how would you respond to this trend?
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.720]   Well, I have three responses.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   Number one, this kind of thinking strikes me as being all of a piece with those Christians
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.000]   today who are voting into office candidates who in another generation would have been
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.280]   called "letchers" and "perverts."
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.080]   Now, here's the connection.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.120]   Issues of moral character, that is, issues of biblical uprightness, are being subordinated
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.920]   to our own strategies for how to make the world a better place.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:34.400]   Those who put immoral people in office reveal that their strategy prioritizes political
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.280]   power over the fruits of godliness as a way to make the world a better place.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.040]   They prioritize political power over the fruits of godliness.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.720]   And those who use vulgar language in order to engage the world in the hope of making
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.040]   it a better place reveal that their strategy for making the world a better place prioritizes
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.240]   being culturally cool over the fruits of godliness.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.160]   In both cases, our trust has shifted from the power of God to work through the humility
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.880]   of holiness onto the power of our own cleverness, whether it be political shrewdness or cultural
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.800]   savvy.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.640]   And I regard this approach to life and transformation as hopelessly flawed.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.920]   It will not bring the kingdom.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.040]   It will not transform culture.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.240]   It will not convict sinners.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.480]   It will backfire and destroy the credibility of the Christian church.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   That process has happened before.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.700]   It is happening again as we speak.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.880]   We have tried this.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.800]   The effort to become like the world in order to save the world in the process, we lose
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.280]   the very thing that we're saving the world for.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   That's been tried.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   We do this cyclically.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.240]   I think at the heart of the mistake this time is not only a loss of confidence in the power
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.440]   of God and the truth of His Word, but even more deeply, a loss of authentic thrill that
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.320]   in Christ and His way and His Word, we have found a way of life that is joyfully, magnificently
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.720]   superior to that the world has to offer.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.360]   We've lost the authentic thrill that our way is better.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.800]   Deep down, these students are probably using vulgar language not because they love lost
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:52.320]   people and want to rescue them for radical purity before a holy God, but rather, they
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.080]   do actually enjoy using that language and being like the world.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.720]   It feels cool.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.920]   It feels good, which means the battle is lost even before it begins.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.920]   That's my first response.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.440]   Here's number two.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.320]   A second response is that we are naive in the extreme if we think that the world will
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.040]   be persuaded about the radically countercultural claims of Jesus Christ, and they really are
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.960]   radical, probably more than these students realize.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.340]   We're naive to think that the world's going to be persuaded about these radical claims
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.120]   of Christ because we make a few superficial changes in the way we talk or the kind of
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.400]   parties we throw.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.080]   I mention that because somebody raised the same issue down in Texas recently.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.920]   This I regard as a ridiculous approach to the pursuit of the miracle of transformed
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   hearts.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.540]   According to the New Testament, what will get the attention of the world and penetrate
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.800]   possibly to the inner recesses of their hearts is not cultural similarity with the world,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.360]   but sacrificial service to the world.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.840]   I'm going to say that again, because that's the heart of the matter on this point.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.440]   What's going to get the world, grab them by the scruff of their neck and shake them
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.160]   into reality, is not cultural similarity with the world.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.480]   "Wow, you Christians know how to throw good parties.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.840]   I think I'll be a Christian.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.480]   What kind of conversion is that?"
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.560]   Not cultural similarity with the world, but sacrificial service to the world.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.640]   In other words, it's not risque language that will waken the dead, but radical love.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.240]   "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good deeds, your sacrificial
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.840]   loving good deeds, and give glory to your Father who is in heaven," Jesus said.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.480]   That may cause the world to be shocked and ask if there is a God in heaven, and if Christ
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.600]   did die for sinners and rise again from the dead.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.160]   I don't think a few changes in words are going to make us more credible on those radical
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   points.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.360]   Here's my last response.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:24.240]   I would point Eden to a passage of Scripture, namely Ephesians 5, verses 3 through 4.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:32.000]   It goes like this, "Sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.600]   be named among you as is proper among saints.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:47.040]   Let there be no filthiness, nor foolish talk, nor crude joking which are out of place or
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   not fitting or unseemly."
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.840]   The Greek, aneken.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.400]   "But instead, let there be thanksgiving."
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.940]   Three observations.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:04.000]   Number one, this kind of nitty-gritty micro personal concern with language is actually
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   there in the New Testament.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.760]   Sometimes we Christians would prefer, it seems, "I wish we could just talk about macro issues
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.520]   like global warming and war and international relations.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.120]   Who cares about crude joking?"
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.920]   Well, Jesus.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.120]   Jesus is Lord of the micro and the macro matters of life, and they're more closely related
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   than people think.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.920]   Number two, second observation about this text in Ephesians.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:41.520]   Paul introduces the moral category of "not fitting" or "not proper" or "out of place."
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.880]   In other words, Christians don't just live by a list.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.360]   We discern what is suitable and fitting in a hundred situations.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.120]   Paul says vulgarity is not fitting.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   Number three, and here's what may be the most surprising thing of all and might go to the
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.060]   heart of the matter best for these young people.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:12.200]   The alternative to crude, vulgar language that Paul mentions is not clean language,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.960]   but thanksgiving.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.600]   In Paul's mind, the problem with people who resort to filthiness and foolish talk and
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:26.160]   cussing and crude and vulgar language is that they have a gratitude deficiency.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.600]   Something's wrong in the heart, and he puts his finger on it.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.800]   They're not overflowing with humble thankfulness.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.760]   That's their problem.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:44.640]   So for these three reasons, I would say to Eden, you may relax and joyfully go about
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.740]   your business, keeping your mouth free from vulgarity, but don't put all the emphasis
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.480]   on what you don't do.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:03.160]   Instead, fill your mouth with Christ-exalting truth, overflowing humble thankfulness, and
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:10.080]   pursue the very good works that Jesus says have a much better chance of impressing the
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   world than if we would just adopt a little bit of their language, which they themselves
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   know is cheap.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   Amen.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.200]   That's a helpful, wide-ranging answer on living a life in this world that's not cheap.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for making the Ask Pastor John podcast part of

[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.960]   Well we are now done for the week, but on Monday we're going to return to ask this,
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.540]   why will some of us get lesser rewards in heaven, and why will some of us get more rewards
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.040]   in heaven?
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   Why the distinction?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:10.960]   And won't this discrepancy cause all sorts of eternal regret and tension among us?
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.280]   This is a really good and important question from a Sharp podcast listener.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.840]   I don't think you want to miss this one.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   It's on Monday.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.880]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
