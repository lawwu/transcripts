[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.640]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.800]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.520]   My guest today is John.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.440]   John, you told me that you've done that, right?
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.360]   You have built financial freedom in 10 years or less, right?
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680]   So we're going to hear your story.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   Definitely.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.720]   And it's not 10 years or less.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   Maybe that's because I chose to live in an expensive part of the country that is Silicon
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.800]   Valley, so it took me a lot longer.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.320]   And of course, I was not as frugal as I could be in the initial days and I still am not.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.160]   So it took me a slightly longer 12 years, but I think it'll be an interesting episode
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   for your listeners.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.880]   So you were born and raised in India.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.880]   That is correct.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.720]   So tell us your story of how you ended up in the United States and then tell us a little
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.480]   bit about your financial freedom journey.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   Sure.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.960]   So I was born in India and I think the advantage of being born in India is the fact that it
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.200]   has a pretty good demographic in terms of the urban area speaking English.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.720]   So at least that outlet is there.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.600]   But I think also in the fact that I was born in a stable family where my parents were always
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.240]   focused on education, ensured the fact that I was always keeping up with my grades, making
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.000]   sure that while the other kids were out partying or having fun, I was like, "Oh, let me do
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   my homework.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.720]   Let me keep up with the studies."
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   Because I think with India and most of other Asian countries, which are highly populated,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.680]   you either need to be at the top 10 or 20% if you want to be somewhere in life or you
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   just stagnate and live along.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.080]   So are you the doctor or are you the lawyer?
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   Which one are you?
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   Neither.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   Actually, I'm the engineer.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.600]   Oh, you're the engineer and your brother's the doctor.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.080]   No, actually, the weird part is he took science as well and then he came along into the similar
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   kind of fields.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.320]   But yeah, I think those are the similar kind of areas which you can go, a doctor, a lawyer,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.240]   an engineer, and those are kind of the respected professions.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.680]   Because way back when I was in India and growing up, it was a very closed economy, I would
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.660]   say, and these were the professions which were more paying well.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.520]   There was a government sector and that was it, but the private sector was not really
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.440]   organized or opened up.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.160]   But recently when I went back, like last year or the year before, I saw that the economy
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.280]   has totally opened up.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.560]   Now you can get a job in marketing or something as well.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.960]   What do you mean by closed economy?
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   You mean that...
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.040]   How do you mean?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   So there was not a lot of foreign direct investment, so you not have a multinational coming in.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440]   You would have more or less the local companies.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.400]   So your earning potential would be limited, your career path would be limited, and those
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.000]   kind of factors would inhibit how much you could earn, how much you could save, how much
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.040]   you could invest, and how free could you live.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.500]   So the idea is previously if you wanted to work in marketing, for example, you could
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.860]   maybe parlay that into a job at a local firm, but there wasn't a big upside potential.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.860]   That is correct.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.560]   So let's say it was going to be a relatively small Indian firm, but now you can go into
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.680]   marketing and you work with a big global multinational and have massive career potential.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   Exactly.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   Understood.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   Understood.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   Okay, so keep going.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   Sure.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.040]   So I think that was an important factor, and both my parents initially were working, and
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.640]   at some point in time my mother decided it makes sense to actually work with us at home,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.140]   and she actually decided to quit her job and then work and make sure we got our studies
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.880]   done, our good grades.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.420]   So that journey continued, and then after that I did my engineering studies.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.420]   In India?
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.420]   In India.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.200]   Is it common that Indian mothers would choose to stay home with the children?
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.480]   So I think it's a mix, honestly.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.200]   Not many would stay.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.800]   It depends on the circumstances and if they are able to contribute to the education.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.240]   Luckily, my dad had a government job, and my mom had a government job too, and at some
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.480]   point in time because of, so we were never rich, we just had a middle class lifestyle.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.640]   I mean, to be honest, even like we would get clothes only for our birthday and then Christmas
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.520]   maybe, and not a huge birthday party, nothing other than your relatives calling to just
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.480]   wish you for your birthday, but that was it, right?
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.880]   So we never, I wouldn't say we were starving or went hungry, but we had a pretty decent
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.600]   life but not a crazy extravagant life, so.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Okay.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Go on.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.760]   So I think at that point in time I decided, okay, it makes sense for me to do engineering.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.360]   The good part about education back in India is it is merit-based in the sense that if
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.700]   I have 100 seats available for engineering, 50% would be available at a very cheap rate.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.060]   The other 50% would be available at eight times the cost, so you would have other students
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.520]   subsidizing you, and you need to then figure out based on your grades which category you
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   fall in.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.920]   Do you fall in the higher category of payment or the lower category of payment?
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.720]   And at some point in time I said, I don't want that debt on my, although my parents
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.520]   were willing to share that and they were like, okay, you can go ahead and choose whatever
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   you want.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.800]   I was like, okay, it makes more sense for me to take the effort to then work on my grades
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.080]   to make sure that on a merit-based, they have an entrance exam, so make sure I have those
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.040]   necessary grades so that I'm in the top of the class and thereby I have my choice of
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.880]   the free seat or what is called the lower payment seat and then have someone else subsidize
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   me.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.560]   So I think in that factor I was lucky and that was more or less my engineering background.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.520]   Is engineering school, is that kind of analogous to the American school, 18 to 22 type of thing?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   Correct.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.760]   That is very analogous to the American school.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.000]   So you graduated with a bachelor's degree in engineering at 22.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Right.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.800]   And then after that I decided to work in the local computer companies over there for a
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.760]   year or two and then incidentally when I was working over there, I thought it made sense
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.800]   for me to work on projects which they were doing for a multinational firm like GE.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.040]   As I was working on those projects, I gained enough knowledge and expertise that one of
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.560]   the big five consulting firms of the US wanted to bid on similar projects to do for that
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.640]   firm.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.880]   And then I was like, okay, it makes sense for me to apply and see if I can try my luck
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   over there.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   And fortunately, I got through the interviews and all of it and they were like, hey, why
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   don't you actually come here and see how it works for it?
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.320]   And I was like, huh?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.600]   No one in my family before that had actually left India.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.800]   More or less what my parents had done was actually move from the villages to the city
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   of Bombay, but that was it.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.080]   Nothing more than that.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080]   And so it was a big step.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.440]   The only thing I knew about the US I'd never visited.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.780]   It was only watching episodes of Friends on television, but that's it.
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.780]   Nothing more than that.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.000]   And I was like, okay, let me see what I can do.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160]   So I had a job offer in hand and then-
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.200]   Wait a second.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.560]   On Friends, no one had jobs.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   They just sat around and did nothing.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.760]   So why did you get a job?
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   Well, Chandler had some jobs and Ross had a decent enough job.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   So I think that works.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.160]   Every now and then they would show them at work when it fit into the plot line.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:24.880]   It's the funniest thing about soap operas and sitcoms and such is it's just, I mean,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.920]   it doesn't parallel life in any way.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.440]   My wife and I laugh about it, how you never see people working.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.080]   You never see, it's a totally different foreign thing.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   Right.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.080]   So keep going.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080]   I have to record you.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.520]   But at least the lifestyle I think helped me understand, okay, oh, this is what happens.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.720]   There are coffee shops, people go in and sit around, talk around.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.480]   Because for me it was all a foreign concept.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.760]   I'd never even left the country, although we had traveled extensively within the country,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   never left the country.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.160]   So I was like, okay, so I have a job offer, then how much money do I have?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.440]   And then finally had just $1,000 cash in my pocket.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.840]   And I said, okay, let me take the shot and come over here and see how it goes.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.120]   And the scary part is-- You've been able to save $1,000 working in
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120]   India.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   Yes.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   Okay.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.520]   And that was partially between, I would say $500 and then $500 from my parents.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.680]   And then I was like, okay, let me take this cash and let me take a job offer and see how
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   it goes.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.320]   And then I landed over here, but that was all I landed with.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.720]   Do you have any idea how much your parents were earning in their government jobs at the
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   time, about that time?
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.280]   What would be the standard pay for a government worker?
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.080]   I did not have a good idea.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.160]   And in fact, I don't do even now.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.520]   I think we talked about finances in general, but not the specific figures.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   Okay.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.680]   So you came to the United States with how much in your pocket then?
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.680]   Just $1,000.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   $1,000.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.100]   And where did you land?
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.840]   So I landed on the East Coast in Connecticut.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   And I was there, I was like, huh, I hope I have enough money and they pay me on time
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.880]   in the next 15 days because A, I signed a lease for like $500 rent because I will soon
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.800]   run out of money and B, then I don't have money for a plane ticket back home.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.720]   And this is kind of a, it's a big fight consulting firm, but then also you have to remember that
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.840]   this is kind of the timeframe where firms like Arthur Anderson just suddenly went belly
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.200]   up and then it's, yeah, it's scary.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.240]   So that was a big risk I would say, looking back.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.680]   And I was like, maybe I was a little crazy taking that chance, but I said, okay, let
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680]   me come here.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.760]   And then it was not easy at that point in time because everything like even buying a
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.280]   cell phone or needing to sign a lease, people want social security, people want credit history
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.720]   and had none of that other than like a job offer.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.760]   And even opening a bank account was not easy.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.240]   So I think I had to go through all the struggles.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   And that's when I started becoming interested in finance because in India at that point
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.580]   in time, at least credit cards were absolutely no, no, no one had credit cards to be honest.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.320]   So did all of that and then tried to slowly go on the internet, learn things.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.880]   Even back home, we did not have good internet.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.960]   In fact, growing up, we did not even have a telephone in the house.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.320]   It was so uncommon.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.640]   If you have to use a telephone, you would go to like in London, you see this telephones
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.400]   along the street, you would typically need to go there, put a coin in and dial someone,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.100]   but no one had telephones at home.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.680]   So that's kind of how we were living.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.660]   - So did the company, the Big Five Consulting Company, did they offer any kind of special
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.400]   services for you since you were a new immigrant?
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.040]   Or did they just say, come and be at work on Monday and we'll pay you in two weeks?
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.800]   - Yeah, they had kind of sent me some documents, but in terms of, okay, orientation and how
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.640]   you would acclimate yourself to the US, but not a lot of onboarding I would say or say
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.880]   that, okay, you can be here for a month, you can get used to it and then start working
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.800]   after a month after you have everything set up.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   - Right.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.160]   Did you have family or friends in Connecticut or were you alone?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.600]   - I had no one, so I was the first of my family to leave the country.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.680]   - So how did you find an apartment to live in?
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.560]   - So before I moved over here, when the company told me, oh, this is where you'd be working,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.080]   I looked online and looked at places which could rent and that's where I found, okay,
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.840]   there's an apartment nearby because I don't even know how to drive at that point in time
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   when I come to the country, right?
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.020]   So I was like, okay, there's something walking distance, let me reach out to these landlords
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.520]   and see who will accept me.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.120]   - Just like an on Craigslist?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.120]   - Yes.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.800]   - So a $500 a month apartment in Connecticut, was it a slum?
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   Was it adequate?
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.720]   - It was adequate because I would not say it was in the center, it was not something
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.880]   like Hartford or something, it was way out in the countryside.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   - Okay, got it, okay.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.760]   Just 'cause it's interesting, one of the things, as you know, I've been a long time listener
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:41.600]   to the show, I'm always fascinated in immigrant stories because it's almost the perfect starting
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.800]   fresh, which is basically what you're talking about.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.440]   For those of us who were born and raised in the United States, you kind of have one way
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   of thinking, but immigrants have a totally different way of thinking.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.360]   And I'm always amazed at how you wind up with immigrant communities and you wind up with
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.240]   all the Nigerians live in this apartment complex or the Indians have this and how so many people
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.760]   who are earning low wages, we'll get to your wages, you weren't earning low wages, but
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.840]   how many people who starting with nothing figure out how to live in very expensive cities.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.400]   It's a mystery to me because it's not, I mean, I've thought about it and I think it's possible,
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:23.160]   but it's hard for those of us who are not used to finding those deals and negotiating
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.720]   those things to know how to do it.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.840]   For me, if I were gonna go to Connecticut and I were just kind of the normal Joshua,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.800]   not the radical Joshua, like you just look at certain types of places that are what you're
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.560]   accustomed to and you wind up in the automatic $1,500 a month range, like that's the comfortable
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.120]   middle-class range.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.200]   But yet the world is not that way and I've talked to immigrants from all over the place
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   who were able to find the deals.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.160]   That's why I'm interested in the details.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.680]   So you rented an apartment, you got a cell phone and you went to work.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   I went to work, yes.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.560]   So then after two weeks they paid you and you said, "Okay, now what do I do with this
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   check?"
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   Now what do I do with this check?
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.120]   Yeah, so it was actually a direct deposit to be honest at that point in time.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   So you've been able to get an account.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.240]   By that time I was able to get an account, but I still had no credit card at all.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.600]   And at that point in time I did not even know about the concept of secured credit card because
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.760]   I was researching just the basics of utilities, cell phone, and I did not even think about
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   credit card at that point in time.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   So I was like, "Okay."
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.840]   And I would use my debit card everywhere I went and this continued for more than a year
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.880]   and a half or two years.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.160]   I was just using my debit card everywhere.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.240]   How did the process of getting a work visa function?
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.440]   So the company which sponsored me actually applied for an H-1B visa and then I had to
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.880]   go to the consulate, get it stamped and then come on an H-1B visa.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.160]   Okay, and they were used to sponsoring tech workers and knowledgeable engineers.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.120]   So do you remember your starting salary at that point?
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.680]   I think it would be $50,000, yeah, around that range.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.520]   So continue the money story then.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   Sure.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.840]   So then after that, the good part about after I got kind of stable, seeing that I'm acclimated
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.880]   to the US lifestyle, I still didn't know how to drive and I still don't know about credit
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.840]   cards or something, but I started trying to research about finance and how do I invest
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.760]   this money, what do I do with this money.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.640]   The company had options like 401k, but I was like, I don't know how long I'm going to be
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.800]   here, what do I do if I need to leave the country or if the company goes belly up, what
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   do I do with the money?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.440]   So I just thought, okay, I'm not even going to opt in the 401k.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.920]   And looking back, that was the worst decision ever.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.720]   Not so much for the tax savings, but the fact that the company used to offer a 50% match
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.040]   and I'm like, oh my God, I just wasted all the free money there.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.920]   And that's when I really needed the money, I could have used it, but yeah, it is what
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.920]   it is.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   So you can only know that much.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   And then, yeah.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920]   And it's hard.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.960]   The hard part about, I think, the US system is that you would have coworkers who are nice,
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.720]   they would chit chat with you at work, but not a lot of them would be open or willing
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.160]   to talk about finances.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.960]   And I think that's where I'm more attracted to the personal finance community because
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.080]   people are open.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.000]   Some may be anonymously blogging, but at least people talk, share their finances, or at least
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.520]   educate other people.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.280]   Whereas if you go to a typical American workplace, and even in this day and age where I live
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.840]   in Silicon Valley, people would be not very open with talking about their finances.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.680]   Whereas if you look back in India, where I was working for the one or two years, people
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.120]   would not only share a high level range of their salary, but also, hey, I'm kind of investing
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.260]   in this, I'm planning to buy this apartment, what do you think?
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.460]   They would bounce ideas off each other and kind of help you figure out what you're doing.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:35.600]   So I think that's, I don't know what it is with America, but a lot of the American workplaces,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.080]   absolutely, they will discuss other stuff.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.920]   Like they will discuss sports, they'll discuss politics, but they will never discuss money.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.880]   It's a very taboo subject.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.600]   - You know, I wonder what it's like on other cultures.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   I wonder if there's something unique about the American culture versus the Indian culture
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   and why.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.120]   I don't have any knowledge of that.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.760]   Doesn't seem wise to me to talk about money in a professional space.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.840]   I wouldn't do it.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.300]   But I don't know if it's just cultural or if there's good defensible reasons.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.880]   So lay out then the arc of your career as far as what happened in your career.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.020]   You started at $50,000 with a big five consulting company.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.760]   And you were doing software engineering?
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   - Software engineering.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:20.180]   And at that point in time, I also wanted to meet my dual goal of travel across the country.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.660]   And what I did is I asked them, hey, every time I'm on a new project, instead of like
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.540]   sticking in the same location, can I pick different clients?
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.740]   And they were like, yes, you can obviously pick different clients.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.700]   So what I did is I moved all along the East Coast, then I moved to the Midwest, and then
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.080]   I moved finally to the West Coast.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.700]   And all along this journey, I was also trying to make sure I keep my career up.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.460]   And in fact, when I launched my blog, and I still see this quite common in Silicon Valley
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.140]   where people don't take care of their career, and that's a major factor which I see can
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.720]   help you achieve financial freedom.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:59.060]   Most of like, you can only frugal so much and cut cost to a certain limit, but your
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.300]   expansion potential with money is unlimited if you keep earning more and more.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.080]   So that's why one of the first blog posts which I wrote was about how to earn more money.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.220]   So basically network with other people, including recruiters, or then I got my LinkedIn profile
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.220]   up and running.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.140]   I talked to other people, I tried to figure out, okay, if I jump companies, what do I
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.140]   do?
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.700]   The fact that I had a visa made it more challenging than other people who are American-born citizens
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.420]   that you could just get up and leave any point in time, because to transfer a visa takes
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   like an act of Congress.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.420]   It's just like, it's a long, lot of process.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.780]   So it's definitely not easy.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.620]   And then you have to deal with the government agencies, and then you can anytime get queries,
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.340]   and then you have to answer it, you need a lawyer.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.620]   So it's difficult.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.380]   So at least within the company, I stayed there for six years, but I did try to make sure,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.820]   okay, I figure out with my boss what's important to them, what would help them take on additional
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.740]   responsibility, see how I could get promoted internally within the organization.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.160]   And in fact, go to some locations or hard projects where no one wanted to go.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.700]   So my last assignment, in fact, was in Minnesota, and no one wants to be in 40 below freezing,
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.500]   but I was like, okay, sure, why not?
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.980]   If it gives me more money and more promotion and access to the higher ups, why not?
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.980]   I'll just take it up.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.260]   And I did that for two and a half years.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.380]   So I think taking on those opportunities at work definitely helped me reach a place where
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.900]   I could then say, okay, now I'm much more comfortable, I have grown enough of my bank
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   balance.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.820]   At this point in time, for my financial journey, I'm just like kind of saving money, squirreling
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.820]   it up.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.660]   I'm not even investing it because I don't know what to do and what I need it for.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.820]   But I'm kind of just like, okay, I'm just saving what I need, I spend it.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.300]   And I was not living very frugally because at some point in time, like you said, after
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.780]   a year or so, then I graduated to the 1500 apartment.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.040]   And then I'm like, okay, I should like live a little better lifestyle.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.980]   So that's where I totally was.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.140]   Not spendthrift, but at least trying to say, okay, I need to buy a car, what do I need
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.140]   to do?
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.060]   I need to take driving lessons, I took driving lessons, bought a new car, brand new.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.740]   It was a reasonable purchase, I would say a Toyota.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.060]   So it's at least definitely I know it'll last me for a while, but new car and then it was
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.620]   like, oh, a chunk of my savings gone.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.980]   But now it is our mobility and I have ability to interact with other people and socialize.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.580]   So kind of went along that path.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.140]   And then when I was in Minnesota, actually, I was contacted by a company in Silicon Valley
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.020]   saying, hey, do you want to come and work with us?
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.260]   And I was like, wondering, should I make this move?
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.260]   But then I realized that for my career, it makes good sense to be in the tech space,
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.780]   in the tech jobs where are all in Silicon Valley.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.200]   So then I decided to move over to Silicon Valley.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.780]   And since then, I've been moving companies every two or three years.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.740]   And that's what I recommend to everyone, no matter what.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.360]   I mean, loyalty is overrated.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.600]   As long as you're working, you can have that in other aspects of your relationship.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.100]   But when you're working, you should definitely see, okay, can I move to the next company?
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.380]   And it's always easier to get a higher raise when you move jobs to a new company versus
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.780]   no matter how well you perform, your current company is not going to give you a 20, 30%
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   raise.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:59.180]   - So trace out your income history from starting at 50,000 a year up through today or the last
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.980]   job or whenever you're willing to share.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.320]   What were the increases like?
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.700]   - So I would say the increases were roughly 10 to 15%.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:15.380]   At my last jobs, I would say I'm roughly slightly over 300 in terms of total compensation.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.420]   - And the reason that you're valuable to your employees, have you done other studies, other
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.260]   degrees or credentialization?
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260]   Or what makes you valuable to your employees?
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.580]   What makes you more valuable to your employers today than 10 years ago when you first arrived?
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.460]   - I would say experience is more valuable in the tech industry versus credentialing.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:40.380]   I tried to do some definitely project program management courses and some of them were sponsored
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.140]   by my employers at different points in time, but none of them involved full-time quitting
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.140]   work.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.740]   There were some programs which were of course marketed saying MBA and all of it, but then
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.900]   I did the ROI on it and I'm like, I'll be out of the job market for two years.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   I'll be not earning.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.700]   I'll be paying this humongous fees, which is like crazy to me.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.140]   And then I was like, okay, it doesn't make sense.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.680]   I kept continuing in the organizations and kept moving and maybe starting a little more
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.120]   on the newer technologies and then trying to apply it and trying to be more valuable
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.420]   to the employers.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.740]   At some point in time, even in the tech industry, you may know all your technologies, but then
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.520]   your people, your interpersonal skills count a lot more.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.900]   And that's where I think people are able to then assess if you're a valuable employee,
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.420]   can you move up the management chain?
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.700]   So at my last jobs, I'm no longer doing coding hands-on, but actually managing teams, managing
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.820]   larger programs, budgets of millions of dollars.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.860]   And I think that's where you can kind of move either in technical capacity or in a managerial
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.260]   capacity, but kind of upward mobility.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.500]   So how did you come across the ideas of financial independence?
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.660]   - So the weird part is at some point in time when I'm working and Silicon Valley, to be
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.260]   honest, is a brutal place.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:56.060]   It looks great, like you watch the episodes on HBO, and most of those are actually true,
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.940]   but the fact that they offer you free food, they offer you laundry on site, they have
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.580]   a notary and everything on site means that they want to actually live on campus.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.160]   They don't want you to have the thought process that I leave campus.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.300]   And the reason for that is they expect you to kind of be working.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.060]   So if you are doing only 60 hours a week, you're kind of a slacker compared to your
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.260]   coworkers.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.740]   And that's where I think at some point in time I was burnt out and thinking, "Wouldn't
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   it be nice?"
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.620]   I'm like looking at my expenses and thinking, "I don't, I have this money stocked up, saved."
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.820]   I'm like kind of investing somewhat, haphazardly buying individual stocks, listening to Jim
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.300]   Kramer and figuring out what to do.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.900]   But I was like, "I need to now know how to actually manage my money, how to invest it,
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.180]   and what I need to do in order to get out of it."
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.820]   And one of the things which also was a trigger point was I remember clearly a meeting where
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:54.260]   my VP was suddenly one week saying, "Oh, my sister is not well and she's very sick."
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.380]   And I was like, "Huh, are you going to go and visit her?"
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.300]   And she's like, "I would like to, but we have this important delivery coming up, maybe after
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   that."
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.900]   And then a week later in the meeting, I was in the same meeting and she got a phone call
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.260]   and then she said, "I have to take this."
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.980]   And she went outside and she came back saying, "Hey, my sister passed away."
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.340]   And I think that was a turning point.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:19.100]   And I was thinking you might be a VP earning more than half a million or close to a million,
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.660]   and yet if someone is telling you when and where you need to show up to work and you
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.180]   don't have the freedom to get up and take care of your loved ones, then I'm like, "You
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.180]   are not free.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.620]   You are a high-paid slave.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.900]   You are still a slave no matter what, if you're high-paid or not."
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.900]   So that's-
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.820]   That's exactly what the term wage slave means.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.140]   That's why we use the term wage slave.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:45.980]   If you were a slave in the era of chattel slavery, you had to work a certain amount.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.420]   Your boss would tell you what to do and you had to do it, but your boss also provided
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.540]   everything for you.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.860]   They provided housing, they provided food, and so the boss had a responsibility to provide
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:02.060]   for you because otherwise his investment in you as a slave, he wouldn't get his money
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.860]   back from investing in you as a slave.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:10.100]   Today there are many people who are wage slaves, that they are responsible and fully beholden
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.860]   to do certain work, but now instead of the boss providing you with a house as part of
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.420]   your compensation package, you have to earn money to go and get a mortgage to pay for
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   your house.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.420]   Right.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.060]   And instead of your boss providing you with food, you have to provide it with food.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.460]   And yet if you don't ever accumulate capital, you can never buy your freedom.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:33.740]   You wind up being a wage slave, and that's exactly what the term means.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.060]   And I can't think of a better example than what you just said, when you can't even go
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:43.180]   and you don't have the autonomy and freedom to say, "I'm going to go and visit a dying
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.940]   relative," because you have to deliver for the boss.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.460]   You have to deliver the big project.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.460]   Yes.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.300]   And that's even at a higher level, right?
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.700]   You think, oh, initially when you start off as a software engineer, think, "Oh, one day
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.140]   if I reach VP level, that'll be a great dream come true."
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.980]   But then you're like, "Oh, even people at that level, at a VP or senior VP level, even
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.740]   at the C level, they're still beholden to someone else."
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.740]   Right.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.140]   Yeah, that's where you think about the ideal career path.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:15.940]   And there certainly can be freedom that comes as you go up the career path.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.260]   But company culture makes a big difference.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:26.140]   And I think there are companies that have a culture that allows people more freedom.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.380]   It may be harder to find a Silicon Valley, maybe not, I don't know.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:35.740]   But if you're in a company that has a culture of overwork in that way, then you don't feel
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.700]   the choice to do it.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.460]   And I don't know what you do except say, "I'm going to go choose a company with a different
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:46.100]   culture," or, "I'm going to be the CEO of my company and have a different perspective."
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.620]   But certainly it does make a big difference.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.620]   True.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:54.320]   And I think the fact that you are so dependent on your living from the wages you get every
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.180]   month and you think, "Oh, if my wages get stopped for six months or one year," I mean,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.260]   ideally you could just be like, "I'm not going to show up to work and in the next six months
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.900]   to one year I'll find some other gig if I don't find anything."
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.780]   But I think the fact that you're so addicted to that monthly income coming in and that
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.420]   you need that to live for your daily life, I think that makes it harder to just suddenly
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.060]   say, "I just don't care."
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:20.500]   And to stereotype, I think it can be especially hard for people in environments like Silicon
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.740]   Valley because there are very high hard costs.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.260]   Your rent is high.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.620]   Your mortgage payment is huge.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:33.240]   But then there are also lifestyle costs that are considered to be normal that would make
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.340]   someone who's involved in that lifestyle feel very embarrassed if they stopped the things
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.780]   they wear, the things they eat, the things they do, the things they drink.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:49.540]   Just it's a culture where, at least what's popularized and what is common among the glitterati,
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.740]   it's a culture of high embedded expenses.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.740]   And I think it's the same.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   It's not just Silicon Valley.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.980]   A lot of it is the big city culture, the afternoon Starbucks, you're a weirdo if you don't partake
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.340]   in all of it.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.580]   And so when you sit down, I've done the analysis for workers in those situations sometimes,
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.500]   unless you're a real curmudgeon and you're totally comfortable just being doing your
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   own thing and you're known as that, which isn't necessarily good for your career path.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   It doesn't endear you to your coworkers.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.820]   Coworkers don't really want to step up and say, "Yeah, you should promote Bob because
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.140]   Bob just gets...
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.580]   Nobody likes Bob because Bob makes them feel bad."
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.780]   So there's a balance there.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:36.020]   But in the big city, corporate, high level, professional culture, which is largely of
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.420]   young people, single people, there's so many embedded expenses with the work lifestyle
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:48.180]   that when people come out of that, if they lose a job, they often just struggle with
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:58.300]   how do I even adjust, how do I live in this place without my daily latte to beat the stereotype.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   It's really tough.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.940]   And it's not making it up.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.940]   These are tough.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.940]   This is a cultural expectation that people have to figure out how to deal with elegantly.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.940]   - Right.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.300]   And I think the most important part is the fixed cost.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.700]   At some point in time, the variable cost like the lattes, you can just eliminate, but the
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.100]   fixed cost is what gets you.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.620]   So you need to figure out a way to make sure your fixed costs are at least stable or you
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.620]   have them in control.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.620]   - Right.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.540]   So I want to talk about the strategies that you have used and are using.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:32.580]   So from the time that you landed in the US to the time when after learning about finance,
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.980]   you came to a point where you said, "I think I'm financially independent."
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   How many years was that?
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.300]   - So at that point in time, I did not even...
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.220]   It was 12 years, but at that point in time, I told you the VP experience, but I was not
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.820]   even at that point in time figuring out if I'm financially independent or not.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.660]   All I knew was I need to get out and I need to figure out an alternative path where I
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.940]   have the option that I can say no to them.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.260]   And I'm like, "What is the amount of money and how do I know that?"
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.700]   Because like I mentioned, my parents were government employees, so they would get a
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.620]   pension whereas over here, I'm a private sector person, so I have nothing to fall back on.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.020]   It's not that I know, "Okay, this is the amount I'll get every month."
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.220]   And I'm like, "What is the amount I need per month to live on?"
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.460]   And at that point in time, I'm not even tracking my expenses.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.700]   So I have no idea how much is my expenses.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.700]   I have money.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.980]   I know it's in the bank, it's invested, but I don't even know how much that return throws
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.980]   off.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.900]   So that's when I got interested in personal finance, started looking at multiple things.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.780]   And that's when I also came across your podcast.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:33.340]   And then I think one of the first podcasts I listened to was Early Retirement Extreme,
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.420]   and he's based out of San Francisco, Jacob Fischke, right?
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.180]   And I was like, "This guy's crazy if he can do that in San Francisco living on like $20,000
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.260]   or something lower than that."
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.260]   I believe at that point in time.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.100]   And I was like, "This is really fascinating."
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.020]   So then I went back, I listened to some more episodes, I went and read some personal finance
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.380]   blogs, and then I slowly figured out, "Okay, at least as a rule of thumb, you can use the
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.100]   4% rule, you can accumulate 25X your annual expenses and assets and have that kind of
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.100]   thing."
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.740]   So that gave me a roadmap and said, "Okay, if I hit this number, then I should consider
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.800]   myself financially independent."
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.760]   It might not line up perfectly.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.500]   Life may throw things at you, but at least I know, "Okay, it's kind of a high level,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.900]   some safety comfort factor."
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.020]   And then I can be like, walk into my next job and say, "Hey, I don't care."
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:23.980]   Because although I'm financially independent, my last job, which I then said, "Okay, I don't
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.100]   want to work anymore."
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.220]   And I was thinking, "Should I work or should I not work?"
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   And I had an offer from Amazon and a bunch of other companies, Silicon Valley organizations.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.260]   And then one organization, which is not Silicon Valley, but still based in that neighborhood,
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.940]   so it's not tech, but it's still based in that neighborhood, gave me an offer.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.700]   And I was like, "Should I take this up because A, it's going to be less stress, and B, more
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.820]   importantly, I like the people I interacted with all through the interview process, but
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.220]   then the fact that the company was a little far away and I have to take BART, which is
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.100]   a local train over there, and connectivity in Silicon Valley through the local trains
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   is not the best."
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.540]   So I was like, I was honest and I said, "Hey, I really like you all.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   I might decide to come and work for you all, but I don't even want to even commute to work
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.540]   every day."
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.180]   And they said, "You seem that you have done really well in your career.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.440]   You interviewed well.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   Everyone on the team likes you.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.740]   You don't even need to come to work physically every day.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.020]   You can just come in once a week, make sure your meetings are on that day, and then work
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.600]   remote for the rest of the days."
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.260]   And I was like, "That is amazing."
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.440]   I mean, I would never, ever get that option in most of the other companies.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.700]   And this is where I thought, "Okay, this is really freeing because A, I don't need the
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.420]   money so I could actually go to them in the interview process and be honest and say, 'I
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.900]   don't want your job.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.500]   But if I don't need to come to work, then I would definitely take this job.'"
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.940]   And then they are like, "Okay, why not?"
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.740]   Because if I was not financially free, I would be afraid of even asking or making that demand
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.020]   right in the interview process.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.780]   So I think that's where it helped me.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.800]   And then I was like, "Oh, this is a nice gig."
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.580]   Because commute time saved is amazing.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.120]   I mean, that is the biggest stress of everyone.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.220]   Even if it's like a 30-minute commute one way, it's one hour of your life wasted.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.220]   And then you have to deal with the traffic, the stress.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.740]   - Hey, hey, people can listen to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.740]   It's not wasted.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.380]   - Yeah, so it's like, oh, I was like, "Oh, that's amazing."
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.380]   - Right, right.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.460]   No, definitely, it's a lifestyle improvement for sure.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:20.020]   So you think that, is it accurate to say that your personal psychology, the strength and
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:27.500]   the confidence that you had from being financially independent helped you to be a much stronger
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.260]   negotiator and to develop something that was a good fit for you?
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.260]   - Exactly.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.260]   Yeah, I think you put it right.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.460]   I think the fact that you are coming from a position of strength also gives them the
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.340]   confidence that you can deliver it.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:46.140]   Because if you are through the interview process kind of wanting that job, a lot of times they
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.580]   were like, "Huh, why does this person really want the job?"
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.940]   And they are more hesitant to give it to you.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.060]   But when you're like, you don't need to be rude, but you're like, "I don't need the job.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.380]   But if you are offering me, then these are my conditions."
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.620]   It kind of puts you as an equal on the table, right?
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.940]   It's no superior, inferior kind of relationship.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.140]   But rather you're just talking as equals to your employer and saying, "Hey, this is what
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.140]   I need.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.140]   Can you give it to me?
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.140]   If not, then that's fine."
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:14.180]   - So I wanna highlight that for the listeners and just draw three lessons, three points
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.060]   from that.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.420]   Because it is true, it does make a difference.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.580]   And just negotiating from a position of strength is hugely important.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:29.100]   Whether it's in romantic relationships, whether it's in job relationships, just in almost
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.180]   anything, just understanding, being confident.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.940]   So number one, the ultimate confidence is true financial independence.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.220]   I don't have to work.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.540]   I can be happy living on my portfolio.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.140]   That's the perfect, that's the ideal place to get to.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.740]   So that's number one, that could be, it is an important goal.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.160]   And I think the reason that's an important goal also is because it's gonna be hard to
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:57.060]   know your personal motivations if you don't, if you really wanna keep working until you
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.380]   recognize you have the option of doing something else.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:05.740]   Number two is, if you're not financially independent, it doesn't mean you can't have that confidence.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.860]   So the important thing is never to get a job when you need one, but always to get a job
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.920]   when you don't.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.060]   So you don't wanna be fired, laid off, in the middle of a recession, desperate for work.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.900]   You wanna be interviewing when you're happily employed and you're just trading up for the
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.900]   next one.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.100]   You've talked about that.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.040]   Every few years, you're always keeping your lines open with recruiters.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.520]   You're building your personal brand in the industry.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.660]   You're making sure that you're regularly getting offers.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.320]   You entertain all offers, but then you're always in a position of strength.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.820]   Because hey, I'm happily employed right now, but hey, if you can make me a better offer,
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.020]   I'm willing to consider it.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.580]   And I don't wanna move across the country, but if you put enough money in the pot, I'm
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.580]   open to it.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.660]   So you don't actually have to have any money to be in a position of strength if you have
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.040]   already established yourself, you've got a job, and you're continually working on upgrading.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.340]   So that's the second point I'd like to make.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:35:00.200]   And the third point is any person who's spending less than they're making can very quickly
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.800]   cultivate enough personal financial security that they can negotiate from the position
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   of strength.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.760]   $10,000 for a lot of people changes things.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:16.200]   $50,000, $100,000 for the average person changes people if you'll let it hit your psychology.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:22.580]   Because if you have $100,000 in the bank, and you need $30,000, $40,000 to live on,
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.900]   which is a reasonable budget that any person could live on in the United States without
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.300]   suffering, you have two and a half, three years of wiggle room.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.800]   So you can very reliably say, "I don't need a job right now."
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.200]   And you can adopt that psychological strength going into job negotiations and such as you
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.960]   work your way towards ultimate financial independence.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:49.200]   And then once you get into that higher level of career orientation where you've said no
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.560]   to the things that you are not good at, you've said no to the things you don't like doing,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.900]   and you've said no to the toxic environments that you don't want to be a part of, then
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.040]   you can say yes to the things that you're good at.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.580]   Say yes to the jobs that you like doing, and say yes to the jobs that come with a really
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.700]   good environment.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.060]   And those are the kinds of jobs and career options that frankly you probably won't want
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.320]   to leave unless something changes.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.180]   And that's why when you pursue that strategy, then the wealth just continues to multiply
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:19.820]   because you could retire any time, but you don't feel any pressing need to, and the job
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:25.820]   provides a useful application of your skills and abilities in the world that leads to fulfillment,
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.720]   leads to contribution to the world, leads to making a difference, and continues to radically
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.180]   transform your financial life.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.060]   And I think the last point is definitely important, Joshua, because to be honest, I'm still working,
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.780]   but although I don't need to work, right?
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.120]   And that's where I think the difference is that I can still go in, be productive, do
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:47.160]   my best for my employer, do the best for myself, but at the same time live stress-free.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.400]   Any time I need a vacation, I can just take vacation.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.040]   Like in December, I took a six-week vacation, went all over Asia, traveled to Cambodia and
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.920]   saw different cultures because travel is really important to me.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.800]   Again, I'm planning to go to Mexico and then do again more trips to Canada, China.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.340]   So I can take long vacations, and my employer is totally fine with that, and that gives
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.440]   me the person, like a strength position where I can actually go in and say, "Okay, this
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.680]   is what I want.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.040]   What do I do to achieve this?"
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.320]   And I think at some point in time, employers as well, when they see an employee doing well,
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.640]   they are able to negotiate, work those things out, and able to create a good, conducive
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   environment.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.840]   So I think it's both ways, and you need to be in that position to create that environment.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   Absolutely.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.120]   So you haven't mentioned marriage, children.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.280]   Have you lived as a single man through this whole process?
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   Yes.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   Okay.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:42.720]   And how do you think that has affected your financial independence journey?
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.240]   To be honest, I don't think it would be very different.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.100]   And to give you some background, I did mention my parents at the initial part of education,
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.500]   but now what I do is I ask them to...
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:59.060]   I feel guilty because in the initial years when I moved to the US, it was just me calling
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.920]   them with a calling card on a phone, speaking to them 10 minutes every week.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.920]   And then as technology improved, both in India and over here, we kept in touch over Skype
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.580]   and kept doing that.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.560]   But once I got financially independent, moved to Silicon Valley, I felt confident enough
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.080]   saying, "Hey, why don't you guys come and stay with me for six months and live with
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.080]   me?"
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.320]   So now the arrangement, which my parents do, is they come and live with me for six months,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.580]   and then they live back home in India six months, just because most of the family and
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.520]   relatives which they grew up with are still in Bombay.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.320]   So that keeps that close connection.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.280]   And when they're here with me for six months, it's really me taking care of all of their
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.360]   expenses.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.440]   And I already have a three-bed, two-bath house in Silicon Valley, so it's not that I'm living
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.460]   in a studio apartment.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.800]   So I think as far as living cost go, it's not drastically different being a single person
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.200]   versus being in a relationship, in the sense that you still need to provide for three people
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.360]   expenses.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.600]   So I think that's kind of where I would have...
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   In Silicon Valley, I think the most important part is housing expense, and as long as you
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.040]   have that under control, you are good.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:12.760]   What strategies have you used to moderate your expenses while living in Silicon Valley?
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.120]   One part which helped me definitely was I was lucky during the crash.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.080]   There were certain areas of Silicon Valley which the prices never budged, but there were
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.800]   other pockets in the Bay Area itself where prices cratered.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.560]   And they cratered by 30% or so, and that was enough for me to say, "Okay, this is the time
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.480]   where I actually need to get in the market and buy something."
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.840]   And my timing was a bit off, to be honest, because I bought my house in 2013 when the
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:44.080]   market had already risen, but not as crazy as it is back now to pre-peak level.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.240]   But then I also had some crazy investment ideas which worked.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.080]   Like I invested in financials, and as it kept going down, I kept doubling down, doubling
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.600]   down until finally Bear Stearns and Lehman happened, and then I was like, "Oh, I should
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   actually..."
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.360]   I actually started buying Citigroup from $12, $8, and then I'm like, "Oh, at $5, it seems
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.640]   like a greater buy, all in."
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.040]   And then I'm like, "Oh, now it's $2."
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.960]   Then I'm like, "Okay, I'm borrowing money," and then I'm like, "Okay, investing," and
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.960]   then when it is below a dollar, I'm like, "I'm really scared now.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.960]   I don't know what to do."
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.160]   But by then, I'm like, "All in."
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.920]   Luckily, I think that bet paid off, and I managed to get enough money which I could
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.160]   then use for down payment.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.600]   So I think taking the strategic risk helped as well, and I was able to...
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.280]   And I clearly remember, in hindsight, it's easy to say, "Oh, everyone should have bought
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.040]   a house during the crash."
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:39.160]   But when I was over there and I talked to my co-workers saying, "Hey, are you guys buying?"
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.840]   Because we all were in a similar situation.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.800]   We'd talk, "Oh, our rents are going up every week.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   To have a one-bedroom apartment in Silicon Valley is $3,000 rent.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   What do we do?"
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.440]   And we keep discussing this, and then the market crashes.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.520]   But when the market crashes, no one was willing to step in and buy.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:59.240]   So it does take a lot of courage to actually say, "Okay, I'm going to make a decision,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.760]   and let me go in, let me put the down payment, and then see what happens."
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.380]   It's just a risk you have to take.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.960]   So I think that risky bet paid off for me as well.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.860]   So luckily, I have a house which I bought at a lower price.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.440]   The best part about California, though, is the property prices are pegged to the buy
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   price.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:21.680]   So the property prices just track inflation, and if you buy it at a low price, it just
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.760]   is low-priced property taxes for the rest of your life.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   - Yeah.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:32.480]   Tell us about the investing strategies you've developed and chosen now, going forward, after
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.680]   years of thinking about it and education.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   - Right.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.600]   So after years of thinking and education, I no longer do...
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   I have a fund portfolio where I still do individual stocks, but most of my portfolio is in well-diversified,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.000]   quarterly mutual funds, just tracking the index of passive index funds that Vanguard
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.480]   Fidelity show up, just track the index and global asset allocation.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.720]   There are some bonds in it, but then I also do some alternative investments.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.640]   So I invest in...
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.440]   Because of my income, I'm an accredited investor, which then opens up the other options for
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   me.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.880]   So I'm able to invest in some art offerings, some marine offerings, some real estate syndication
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:15.520]   deals, and those provide a good enough yield, because I never believed in bond portfolios
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.760]   yielding low returns.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.560]   I have some treasuries which have done really well this year because of the bond convexity,
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.200]   but other than that, it's more or less trying to get yield from all these alternative investments
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.160]   like real estate syndication, art, marine offerings, those kinds of things.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.760]   So I've kind of kept that as my bond portfolio.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.860]   In addition to that, I also have a rental property I bought in Silicon Valley.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:41.400]   So the good part about the rental property is that it exactly matches my mortgage.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.480]   So technically, although I haven't paid off my mortgage, I consider that my rental property
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.680]   is paid off, so I'm living rent-free in my house.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.720]   So you carry a mortgage on your primary house, but the rental property is mortgage-free.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   And so basically, your tenants are paying off the mortgage on your primary house.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:06.280]   I think those mental tricks are powerful when you can say, "Okay, I want to buy this.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.640]   I want to live in this house.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.160]   So how can I generate an investment that's going to pay for this for me?
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.720]   Because I don't want to pay for it, but I want to live in this house."
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   Absolutely.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   I think that's powerful.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.160]   And that's true financial independence, right?
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.120]   You have a paid-off house, technically speaking, where you are living free, and then you only
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.080]   need to say, "How much do I actually spend on travel?
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.160]   How much do I spend on food?
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.720]   How much do I spend on clothes?"
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.800]   And when you actually add it up, it's very little.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.920]   And that expense, whether you're in Silicon Valley or you're in Kansas, it's the same.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:39.000]   I mean, food doesn't cost a lot more in Silicon Valley compared to anywhere in the Midwest.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.480]   How do you weigh, having traveled and worked across the United States, how do you weigh
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:50.720]   the costs and benefits of living in Silicon Valley?
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.280]   I would say for technology individuals, it would still make sense to move to Silicon
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.960]   Valley, make a ton of money, and at some point in time, if you think this is expensive, you
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.500]   can move out.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.040]   The opportunities you get in Silicon Valley are tremendous.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.440]   Like I mentioned, I've never needed to ever hunt for a job.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:13.600]   I've been always quoted and people reach out to me for jobs, and then you can keep getting
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.040]   a lot of money.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.160]   You would kind of rent an apartment.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.720]   You would not have your own house maybe initially, but over a period of time, I think the amount
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.480]   of money you can amass through that route is much greater.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.520]   Of course, now Silicon Valley is more diversified, so you have options like Austin, Boston, other
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.200]   tech hubs, Raleigh, North Carolina, which are coming up.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.760]   Amazon is opening up an office outside of Seattle.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.840]   So those options are there, but still I would say Silicon Valley, if you're in technology
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.360]   field, you should move there.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:47.160]   If you're not in the technology field, I don't think people have any business living there.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.480]   I know there are people who work at Starbucks who live in Silicon Valley.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.520]   I would honestly, if I was not in technology and I worked at Starbucks and those were my
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.040]   only skills, I would just move out and get a similar job somewhere else.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.320]   I have a cultural question for you.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:10.440]   I have the opinion that Indians who are smart and who leave India and go where there are
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:16.400]   more economic opportunities are very efficient at becoming wealthy.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.760]   I don't know if that's true because I've never charted the data on it.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.440]   I don't know if there are poor Indians living in the United States who, yeah, they are from
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.480]   the Indian culture, but they just are always struggling.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.240]   But my anecdotal experience has been that Indians do really well in the United States.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.960]   It's been hard for me to find, again, examples of just normally competent people who do come
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:49.480]   to the United States and work and pursue opportunities that they become wealthy.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.360]   First, do you think that's true?
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.020]   I think it's more the first generation immigrant who comes over here, they understand the struggles
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.480]   and they will be careful about everything and be wealthy.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:06.200]   But culturally, I don't think there's anything specific about Indians or any other ethnicities.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.440]   So to give you an example, like Silicon Valley and that neighborhood has a lot of people
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.560]   from Vietnam, some of who came during the Vietnamese war.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.080]   But the people who are born there, the second or third generation people I meet are more
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:25.440]   American than Vietnamese and their way of living and spending would be more similar
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.480]   to the Native Americans versus their home culture, right?
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.520]   And I could see them degrading in a lower level lifestyle versus the immigrants who
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.560]   actually came in the first wave.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.440]   So I don't disagree with that.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.360]   I totally agree.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.480]   But what I'm interested in is first wave, like first wave immigrants.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.600]   Because I don't have the same impression, for example, about Guatemalans who come to
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   the United States.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:56.920]   I've known a lot of Guatemalan immigrants, but Guatemalans, I know a couple of Mexicans
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.640]   who immigrated to the United States who are at upper levels of income, but I don't know
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:10.400]   any personally, I've never met any Guatemalans who experienced the career success, the wealth
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.320]   success, etc. that Indians seem to experience.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.520]   So that's what I'm focused on.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.840]   I'm just trying to say what are the lessons from the Indian culture?
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.440]   Because to me, it seems to me that here's what I see.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.440]   You tell me.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.200]   It may be easy, it may be hard for you to analyze your native culture.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   Right.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.200]   Right.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.720]   Because I'm like, if I'm sitting in the ocean, I see water everywhere.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.720]   Exactly.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   I think it's normal.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.720]   Exactly.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   So here's what I see.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.760]   Here are the advantages I think that Indians have over immigrants from other cultures.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.560]   Number one, you grow up speaking English, right?
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.520]   For those who don't know, it's my understanding that in India, it's standard that children
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.440]   are taught three languages, India, Hindi, and a local dialect generally.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.320]   Is that pretty true?
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   That's true to some extent.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.600]   So the urban areas, people, the medium of instruction is English, but not so in the
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   rural area.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   So it also depends on the city where you were born.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.260]   So you had the benefit of growing up in an urban area, your parents had already moved
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:08.480]   from the country to the city, and you had the benefit of learning English as a child.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   That's a huge benefit.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   It is.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.480]   Definitely.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.440]   If you were born in the United States, you could come as a professional worker, which
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.480]   we'll get to education in a minute, but you had to be able to speak English to do that.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:26.360]   Whereas somebody who comes from Guatemala to take a manual labor job doesn't speak English,
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.880]   and so that really harms them.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:33.560]   I'm forever desperately trying to get Hispanic immigrants to the United States.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.800]   You've got to learn English.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.460]   The very first thing you got to do is to learn English.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.100]   So that's one advantage.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:47.560]   Number two, there seems to be an intensive culture in India where parents are willing
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.680]   to make almost any sacrifice for the betterment of their children.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.240]   So parents will work forever.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.920]   If it makes my children better, I'll do it.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.040]   And a lot of that comes down to schooling and education.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.080]   In the Indian culture, schooling and education are massively valued.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.680]   And then with those foundations, with being able to speak a language, and then the schooling
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:16.860]   and education and culture, you add that to immigration.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.720]   I have not been to India.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.520]   I kind of wonder very much what's happening in India.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.280]   Of course, you got a country of a billion people.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.480]   How do you even know?
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.040]   But I feel like all the smart Indians leave and go somewhere else.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.840]   I meet Indian immigrants all over the world, and I often wonder, there's got to be a bunch
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:39.040]   of smart Indians staying, but there's no question that intelligence and skill, then you put
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.600]   it into an economy like the United States, where the average American that's born in
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.040]   the United States succumbs to that second and third generation malaise.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   They're not really hungry.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.040]   They're not willing to sacrifice.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:58.880]   And it just seems to me that new immigrants who have those benefits just wipe the floor.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.400]   They see the opportunities and they take advantage of them.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.120]   I don't know.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.440]   Do you think that's accurate?
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.440]   My analysis is accurate?
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   I think that is accurate.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.120]   And to answer your question with respect to what's happening now in India, when I last
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:16.780]   visited two years ago, a lot of reverse brain drain is now happening because the Indian
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.120]   economy has opened up.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.160]   It's now more capitalist and market driven.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.600]   So like Amazon has a rival, the Flipkart, which has opened up and giving Amazon a tough
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.240]   competition in India.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   Amazon has been trying forever, but it can't gain market share in India.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.760]   I think similar phenomena is occurring in China as well, where a lot of Chinese immigrants
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.080]   come here, study and sometimes say, "Oh, it's better off to go back to China and work over
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   there."
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.040]   So I think that's good, where as each economy is opening up, people are having that opportunity
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.080]   to go back to their country of origin, work over there and then contribute to that society
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   as well.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   Yeah, I hope so.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.400]   To me, the lessons are obvious.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   Those things that I said, you mentioned being raised in a stable home environment.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.480]   It's incalculable how big of an impact that makes on you in time.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.160]   And then having family that loves you, that supports you, is willing to deal with the
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:11.000]   hardness of your going abroad.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.680]   I find it very inspiring.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.920]   Now if we can figure out how to get second and third generations to keep the good things
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:24.560]   about the immigrant attitude and not succumb to the malaise of comfort and wealth, then
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.600]   we'll really have something.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:32.240]   But I don't know how to do that, other than to, my theory is that if we deprive our children
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:38.160]   and put them into hardship, because that deprivation and that hardship is the thing that has a
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.760]   formative influence on new immigrants.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.960]   If you've slept on the street, if you've not known where your next meal is going to come
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:53.680]   from, if you've experienced hardship and want and distress, then you recognize comfort and
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.920]   ease and luxury when you see it.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.760]   And then you look at it and you say, "Well, this is simple.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.200]   I just need a good job and save money.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.520]   And look, this apartment is $500 a month, but this is better than I could have had back
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.040]   home for, you know, this is nice."
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:16.000]   And so my theory is that there's got to be a way to expose our children to plenty and
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.720]   security, et cetera, but also expose them to hardship and deprivation so they can gain
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.960]   the lessons of both.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.680]   Because if it's too much hardship and deprivation, right, some guy who's living in the middle
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.140]   of nowhere, India, who has nothing but a mud hut, like too much hardship and deprivation
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:38.800]   can lead to somebody just simply not having either the knowledge that they can have ambition
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.240]   or the ability to do that.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.320]   You weren't raised in that, right?
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:46.240]   You were raised in relative prosperity, kind of a middle class, you had a roof over your
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.200]   head, you weren't sleeping on the street.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.580]   Sleeping on the streets can be really destructive to the psychology of a human.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:57.360]   But there's a difference, like there's got to be some right balance where we're comfortable,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.640]   we're safe, those basic needs of life are met, but yet there's still enough challenge
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.040]   and hardship and deprivation to make somebody feel hungry.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.220]   - Right, and I think the culture which the parents have the ability to push their children
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.920]   and it's not looked upon as strange, I think that helps a lot.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:18.840]   I remember when I came to the US, I read the story, it was called, it was a huge deal,
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.160]   it came in the New York Times, which was the battle cry of the tiger mom, and there were
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.200]   like so many comments on that article.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.600]   And when I read that story, I was like, that seems normal what the mother did to the Chinese
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.840]   daughters, like playing piano, make sure you study and do all of this.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.600]   But as I read the comments, people are like, oh my God, what a bad mother, blah, blah,
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   blah.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.160]   And I'm like, that does not seem like a bad mother to me, it seems just normal to me,
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.720]   but I think that's a huge cultural difference.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:54.240]   - Well, what's happened is that in the American culture, the individualism and basically,
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.320]   Americans speaking broadly, especially the secular elite, like the culture makers on
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:05.080]   the left and right coasts, have basically accepted the philosophy that you do you, right?
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   This is the idea.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:11.320]   There is no right or wrong, there's no better or worse, something is right because you want
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   it.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.120]   So you live how you want to live.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:19.960]   Well, if that's true, right, which many people accept that as being the basic philosophical
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:26.480]   truth that the highest and best thing I can do is to express myself, to be myself, to
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.480]   let it out.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.800]   I wanna be me, I wanna be free.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.160]   What does the Frozen song say?
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.280]   Let it go, right?
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:37.160]   Don't be inhibited by the rules, don't be inhibited by standards, don't be inhibited
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.840]   by other people's opinions of you, let it go, let it go, let it go, right?
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:46.080]   That's the basic operating philosophy of the majority of the American coastal secular elite.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.800]   Now in that, then you come to child training.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.600]   Well, if it's right for you as a parent, then it's right for your child.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:00.080]   And so parents often then impose that idea on their children that instead of saying there's
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:06.480]   a process of education whereby I'm going to teach my child what he or she needs to learn,
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:11.160]   it's just simply the goal of education is to let my child's innate goodness flower and
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.320]   let it out.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:17.640]   And so my goal is to indulge these things and to indulge them so that whatever their
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.200]   right path is in life, then they'll find it.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:25.360]   And so that basic educational philosophy sets the difference.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:30.200]   In the Indian culture, your parents know if you are well educated, if you're good at math,
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.680]   if you're good at science, if you become a doctor and a lawyer, you can have a better
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.680]   life.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.560]   You can have a better life, therefore you will study your math.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.880]   And that's imposed on you and the standards are held there.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:45.360]   And if you come home with a B, your mom is looking for something to teach you a lesson,
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   right?
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:52.360]   Whereas in the American culture with this basic concept of a philosophy that says you're
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.200]   good however you are is just the right way to be.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:00.120]   Then if my child comes home with a B in math, you just don't like math.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.360]   That's okay.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.800]   Maybe you'll find something else that you like better.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.360]   And as far as I'm concerned, the evidence is obvious.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.400]   Just look at the earning ability, look at the wealth accumulation, look at the success
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.560]   in academics.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   There's no question.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:17.760]   Now again, I'm not, maybe there are times that the Indian mom goes too far, right?
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.760]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.820]   I don't have an Indian mom, but maybe there are times where it goes too far and maybe
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:27.000]   there's a right balance, but I'm not in favor of the American system.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.880]   I don't know if I'm in favor of the Indian system.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.400]   I think there again is an intelligent way to say, no, you're not good enough just the
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.400]   way you are.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.680]   You're not, oh, you're five years old.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.680]   You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.680]   You're five years old.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:43.320]   Like sit down, learn, and take the instruction of your elders without destroying the child
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.840]   and saying, well, you're just worthless because you don't get A pluses in math.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.200]   - Right, and if we extrapolate that, Joshua, to even like the student debt crisis, which
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:55.120]   is there, I honestly still believe that if someone today in America goes to school for
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.760]   medicine or engineering, they will have huge debt, but they will land a job and they can
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.480]   easily repay that debt.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:08.480]   If you go to school to study like pyramids of Egypt, that's a pyramid scheme in itself
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.160]   because you're paying the college and then the only job you can get is being a professor
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.960]   teaching other people the same thing.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.480]   I'm like, what is the value out of it?
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:22.960]   I mean, history is great, but you could just do that, go to the library, check out 10 books,
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.920]   just read it, and then you know the pyramids of history.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:29.080]   I'm like, why do you need to spend money and thousands of dollars?
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.440]   At the end of the day, I think when people spend money on education, they should be like,
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.520]   what does this contribute to society and who is willing to pay for my skills, right?
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.080]   I mean, as an engineer, I know that, okay, if I can code, someone is benefiting with
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.100]   that code and is willing to pay me.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:47.440]   But if I can paint or something, maybe my painting is famous, but that possibility and
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.520]   that risk is so high that it's clearly not worth taking.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.520]   - Right.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:58.400]   Well, it's obvious that you're right, but I would just kind of point out, why then do
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.600]   we have the cultural conversation?
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.400]   Well, if you're taught as a child, as I'm a millennial, right?
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.320]   Most of my peers, we have been taught this as children.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.580]   If you're taught as a child that the most important thing in life is that you are allowed
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:18.120]   to express yourself, that you're allowed to be you, and that your self-fulfillment is
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:24.360]   the ideal goal, then that naturally results in many people, not all, there are lots of
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   intelligent people who made different choices who chose to study something that paid them
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   well.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:33.640]   And the natural result is that you try to choose something that leads you towards self-actualization
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.200]   rather than leads you towards profitability.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:41.240]   And then what happens is, it's very easy psychologically, once you get into a certain groove, just like
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:45.120]   once you say, it's like, I don't go to new car dealerships and look at new cars, right?
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.320]   I don't do it because I don't know if I would have the self-control to say no to the new
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.320]   car.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.200]   I love them, the technology is great, you go and you sit in them and you look and you're
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.840]   like, man, this would be so much better.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.480]   So because I don't know if I would have the self-control in that situation, I don't go
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   there.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:04.920]   But almost anything in life is basically the same thing as going and shopping for cars.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.000]   If you don't make a decision in advance that I'm going to choose a course of study that
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.960]   will lead to a practical benefit, and you say, well, you know what, I'm interested in
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.020]   pyramids of Egypt, and you go and you find, man, there's this guy who knows everything
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:19.880]   about the pyramids of Egypt, and you say, look, there are 10 anthropologists all around
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.560]   the world who are making their living on the pyramids of Egypt, I can do that too.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:29.200]   And you don't do an accurate analysis of the fact that, look, there are also 10,000 people
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.640]   with degrees in pyramids of Egypt, and they're failing, and they're working at the grocery
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.080]   store bagging groceries.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.960]   People don't really make that analysis.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.560]   And then built upon the philosophy of self-actualization, what would make me happy, what would make
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.740]   me fulfilled, then you move in that direction.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:47.400]   Your mom and dad didn't ask you what would make you happy, what would make you fulfilled,
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.680]   they said study, because this is good for you.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.600]   And then you find out, hey, engineering works, and you figure out how in the context of engineering
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.120]   to find the greatest happiness and fulfillment in the best environment you can.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:04.000]   But there's gotta be a link of, I'm all for self-fulfillment, I feel very fulfilled doing
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.640]   what I do, but there's gotta be a good link to the practicality of our decisions.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.240]   If you separate them, you wind up with a crisis.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   - True.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   Yeah, so the choice is only for typical Indians growing up in India is either medicine, doctor,
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.680]   or lawyer, and you get to make your own choices, but it's limited to those choices.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.680]   - You know, with good reason, though.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.960]   If you go back to, in the United States, there was Tom Stanley, was an author, he interviewed
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.120]   a lot of wealthy people, and he wrote a number of books, and one of the basic recommendations
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.260]   that the wealthy people in his studies would make to their children is that their children
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.920]   acquire a professional degree, that their children become doctors, lawyers, or engineers
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.200]   in many ways.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.920]   Even though many of his interviewees were wealthy entrepreneurs, they knew how fraught
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:55.520]   entrepreneurship was with difficulty, and how you're always on the line between success
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   and failure.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.640]   And when it's successful, it's nice, but you know all the things that have gone slightly
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.760]   wrong would lead to failure, and they recommend the safe path to their children, become a
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.880]   loctor, doctor, lawyer, engineer.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.360]   They know, recommend these things.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.680]   So you're not alone, and it's true, right?
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680]   It really is true.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.080]   - And I think given the fact that internet has democratized information so much, it's
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.960]   hard for me to understand anyone in the US, even someone who's earning minimum wage, ideally
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.640]   if they spend enough time, they can set up like a new website on the side, they can sell
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.640]   products.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.800]   When I was taking my vacation in Thailand, I met so many people from Thailand actually
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.120]   buying stuff from Alibaba, selling it to the Americans on Amazon, just doing fulfillment
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.160]   by Amazon drop shipping, and they're making tons of money, and they are not in the US,
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.200]   but they still, just by knowledge of the internet, knowing English, they are able to just arbitrage
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.880]   and just make money.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.800]   And I'm like amazed that people who live here don't have that entrepreneurship.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:03.120]   They will argue with people over Facebook, over Twitter, and like waste time following
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.680]   what the latest Kardashians are posting on Instagram, instead of like kind of doing something,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.320]   which will trickle in money, build your skills, and then those skills are useful.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.120]   Even if it fails, just take small bets, if it fails, you have those skills, just apply
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.120]   to the next gig.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   - Yeah.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.360]   I don't have an answer for it.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.440]   I think about it a lot, and I try to be thoughtful and not just say everyone's wrong, but there's
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.360]   something about inspiration, right?
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.360]   If you don't believe that you can do it, you do that.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.560]   There's something about the experiences that people have had.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.480]   You know, a lot of people are beaten down psychologically.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.000]   A lot of people have experienced a lot of suffering, and that harms their confidence.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.880]   There's something about character and discipline, doing the hard work.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.960]   It's great to have an idea, it's hard to execute on them.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.240]   There's something to be said for ability.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.480]   There's something to be said for intelligence.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.200]   I do, I've noodled on that for a long time, and I still don't know that I have answers.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.120]   I know that the answers are out there for someone who seeks.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.080]   One of the things I wrote down as I was listening to you talk is you demonstrated an interest
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.600]   in the story that you shared.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.100]   You demonstrated an interest in learning and looking for answers.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.480]   You recognized, oh, I have money.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.120]   I have your money now, I have an income.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.600]   What should I do with that?
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.720]   I don't know why everybody doesn't do that, but I know that most people don't.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.920]   Most people don't go look for answers.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.520]   Most people don't, if they're unhealthy, they don't just keep looking and keep, you know,
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.560]   if a doctor tells them it's incurable, they don't just go and fire that doctor until they
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.800]   find someone who tells them it's curable.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   They say, oh, it's incurable.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.960]   Okay, I'm going to lie up and lay down and die now, right?
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.200]   And it's the same thing.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.480]   Very few people just seem to possess that natural or trained knowledge of I'm going
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.720]   to get better at this.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.120]   So I don't know what we do other than try to talk and share and inspire people, because
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.920]   I do know almost anybody, whether they're Thai or Guatemalan or native-born American
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.400]   or whatever, I know that once they get some inspiration and someone lays out a path, then
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400]   they can start to build.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.200]   - Definitely, and I think that's where I decided, even like within Silicon Valley, I've seen
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.080]   so many of my coworkers be stressed.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.600]   So I said, okay, I should start a blog because all of them come to me for advising, even
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.680]   basic things like what 401(k) investment should I choose or what should I do with my excess
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.680]   money outside?
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.240]   Should I sell my company RSU stocks?
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.400]   Is it too much diversification risk?
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.120]   So I said, okay, I might as well rather than talk to each person over and over again.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.560]   So I said, okay, I'll start a blog and start like typing on all my thoughts.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.080]   I might not have all the answers.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.120]   In fact, I might be wrong most of the times, but at least it fosters dialogue, puts my
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.120]   opinion out there.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.720]   And if someone thinks differently, I mean, feel free, like come in the comment section,
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.200]   talk about it, and then I might change my opinion and I might go a different route.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.640]   So I think that's where I decided to go along this journey.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   - Your blog is financialfreedomcountdown.com.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   - That is correct.

[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   that you've laid out.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   - Right.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.000]   - The financial independence, early retirement, et cetera.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.040]   Is there anything I've missed in today's interview?
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.060]   Anything you'd like to share with my audience?
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.400]   Being a long time listener of the show, is there anything you'd like to share that you
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.920]   wish I'd asked you about or any just personal desire to encourage your fellow listeners?
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.000]   - No, I think Joshua, this was definitely a good thought process and it helped clear
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.720]   some of the concepts in my mind as well.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.440]   And it's great after listening to so many episodes to actually meet you in person and
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.000]   talk and be on the podcast.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.040]   So I can't tell you how excited I'm for all of this.
