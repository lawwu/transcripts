[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.700]  venes: So you went to marketing and you've worked with a big global multinational and have massive career.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:50.840]   Exactly. Understood. Right. Okay. So keep going. Sure. So I think that was an important factor. And both my parents initially were working and at some point in time, my mother decided it makes sense to actually work with us at home. And she actually decided to quit her job and then work and make sure we got our studies done, our good grades. So that journey continued. And then after that, I did my engineering studies. In India. In India.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.580]   I think it's a mix, honestly. Not many would stay. It depends on the circumstances and if they are able to contribute to the education. Luckily, my dad had a government job and my mom had a government job too. And at some point in time, because of so we were never rich. We just had a middle class lifestyle. I mean, to be honest, even like we would get clothes only for our books. So it was a mix.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.660]   care

[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.020]   and Ross had a decent enough job so I think that was it. -Wait a second. On Friends no one had jobs. They just sat around and did nothing so why did you get a job? -Well Chandler had some jobs though. And Ross had a decent enough job so I think that was it. -Every now and then.

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:09:11.700]  udi i hope i have enough money and they pay me on time in the next 15 days because a i signed a lease for like 500 dollar rent because i will soon run out of money and be then i don't have money for a plane ticket back home and this is kind of a it's a big fight consulting firm but then also you have to remember that this is kind of the time frame where forms like arthur anderson just suddenly went belly up and then it's yeah it's scary so that was a big risk i would say looking back and i was like maybe i was a little
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:23.000]   like
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:34.160]   had to go to the consulate to get a stamp and then come on an H1B visa.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.400]   Okay and they were used to sponsoring tech workers and knowledgeable engineers.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.440]   So do you remember your starting salary at that point?
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.880]   I think it would be 50,000 around that range.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.040]   So continue the money story then.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.480]   Sure so then after that the good part about after I got kind of stable seeing
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.320]   acclimated to the US lifestyle.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:23.480]   I still didn't know how to drive and I still don't know about credit cards or something.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:43.640]  .
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:51.960]   So I'm like, oh my God, I just wasted all the free money there.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.040]   Right.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.680]   And that's when I really needed the money.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.200]   I could have used it but I yeah, it is what it is. So you can only know that much and then yeah, and it's hard. The hard part about I think the US system is that you would have coworkers who are nice. They would chat with you at work, but not a lot of them would be open or willing to talk about finances and I think that's where I'm more attracted to the personal finance community because people are open.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.480]   So I'm not sure of what I'm saying.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:23.480]  , but at least people talk share their finances or at least educate other people. Whereas if you go to a typical American workplace and even in this day and age where I live in Silicon Valley, people would be like not very open with talking about their finances. Whereas if you look back in India where I was working for the one or two years, people would not only share a high level range of their salary, but also, hey, I'm kind of investing in this. I'm planning to buy this apartment. What do you think they would bounce ideas about the next.

[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   That's exactly what the term wage slave means that's why we use the term wage slave you know if you were a slave in the era of cattle slavery you had

[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:18.940]   Right, and I think the most important part of the fixed cost at some point in time the variable cost like the lattes you can just eliminate but fixed cost is what gets you so you need to figure out a way to make sure your fixed cost are at least able or you have them in control.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:34.540]   Right, so I want to talk about the strategies that you have used and are using but so from the time that you landed in the US to the time when after learning about finance you came to a point where you said I think I'm financially independent how many years was that.

I don't do it because I don't know if I would have the self-control to say no to the new car. I love them. The technology is great. You go and you sit in them and you look and you're like, man, this would be so much better. So, because I don't know if I would have the self-control in that situation, I don't go there.
