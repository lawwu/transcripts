[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   I would like to call your attention once more to the words which are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:21.360]   epistle to the Ephesians, in the second chapter, verses 20, 21 and 22. Verses 20, 21 and 22,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.640]   in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, and built upon the foundation
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.440]   of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.240]   all the building fitly framed together groweth unto one holy temple in the Lord, in whom
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.800]   ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.960]   Now here, you remember, the apostle is giving us his third picture of Christian people.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.800]   He's thinking especially of these Ephesians, who once upon a time, as pagans, were aliens
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.680]   from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, were without
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.160]   hope, without God in the world.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.440]   But he says in verse 19, "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:36.360]   fellow citizens with the saints, of the household and of the household of God, and are built
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.300]   upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets."
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.960]   In other words, as we've been seeing, the apostle uses three pictures here to describe
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.560]   the Christian church, the character, the nature of the Christian church, and therefore the
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   privilege of our position as Christians, as members of the church.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.000]   Now, at the moment, we are engaged in studying this third picture, in which he says that
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.160]   the church is a kind of building, a great temple, in which God dwells and is yet going
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.800]   to dwell in a still larger and fuller manner.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.880]   Now, we've looked at this picture in general.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.360]   Whenever you're examining or looking at a building, you take a general glance always
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   first.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.180]   Before you come to details, you want a general impression of the whole edifice.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.300]   We've done that.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.040]   But we have noticed that the apostle doesn't merely give us a general description of this
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   building.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.320]   He tells us in detail something about the plans and the specifications which were observed
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.720]   and must always be observed in the erection and building of such an edifice.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.960]   We started, therefore, of necessity with a foundation, the thing the apostle starts with.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.600]   We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.240]   chief cornerstone.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.680]   Then having looked at that, we came last Sunday morning to the next thing he tells us.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.160]   And here, of course, we are coming more directly to a consideration of ourselves and that which
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.440]   is true of us.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.000]   And we saw that he says that there are certain things which we must always keep in our minds,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.920]   that as stones in this building, we are all related to the foundation, we are all related
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   to the Lord Jesus Christ, we are all related to truth, but, and this is the thing that
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.760]   he seems to emphasize most of all, we are all also related to one another.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.260]   In other words, the important phrase here is this word which has been translated by
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.080]   three words, "fitly framed together."
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.120]   Now then, that's the word that we've got to take hold of again.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.640]   There are all these individual stones in this wall, in these walls that are going up, and
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.520]   they're all fitly framed together.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.000]   I mustn't go over that again, but I did show last Sunday morning how the apostle used one
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.080]   word, which is rarely three words put into one, in order to bring out this important
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.080]   truth.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.600]   And we said that what he teaches, therefore, is this, that in this building and in our
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.280]   finding ourselves as stones in this building, there is an element of choice.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.840]   There is an element of choice and rejection.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.440]   The master builder takes hold of a stone, finds it isn't suitable, he rejects it.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.000]   Then he chooses some and puts them there.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.720]   But that also reminded us of this, that we are not all absolutely identical.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.760]   We are all in the same building, we are all on the same foundation, we are all in the
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.040]   same relationship to Christ.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.440]   But we are not bricks, we are stones.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.840]   There is not a dull, drab uniformity in the Church.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.040]   All Christians are not meant to be identical in every respect with others, no, no.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.200]   As the apostle proves at greater length in 1 Corinthians 12, like the members of a body
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.360]   differ tremendously from one another, so do members of the Church, but they are all parts
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.680]   of the same body and they have different functions to serve.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.880]   Therefore, we must be careful always to note that point.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.280]   It is a characteristic of cults that all the devotees of cults tend to be the same always.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.400]   That is not a characteristic of the Christian Church.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.980]   There is diversity in unity.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.480]   It is one of the greatest glories of the Church.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.080]   And at a time like this, when there is so much talk about union and unity, it is of
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.840]   vital importance that we should bear that principle in mind.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.880]   Then we ended off with this point, that obviously all these stones need to be prepared before
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.160]   they are placed in position in the wall, they are obtained from the quarry, but they are
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.980]   not right as they are.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.600]   If they are to be fitly framed together, if they are to fit into one another and therefore
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.360]   do their work, well, they need a certain amount of preparation.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.680]   And we dealt with that up to a point at the end last Sunday morning.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.600]   But now we continue with that particular theme.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.680]   Now let me indicate this, all these things are pictures and obviously therefore any one
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.280]   picture cannot contain the whole truth.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   That is why the Apostle, you see, has to use three different pictures here.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.000]   No one of them is sufficient in and of itself.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   So that in dealing with this preparation last Sunday morning, I indicated that a certain
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.520]   amount of preparation was necessary beforehand and also that, in a sense, the preparation
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.680]   always continues.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.120]   That is a sort of paradox which you find in the New Testament about the Church.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   On the one hand we are given the impression that God already dwells in the Church, and
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.160]   he does.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   And yet there is this other idea that the Church is still being built for inhabitation,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   into which he is going to come to dwell when it has been completed.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:46.960]   So that therefore, while in a sense we are already prepared, we still need this process.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.000]   But there are other illustrations which are used in order to bring that out.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.240]   Now then let us come back to this great question of how exactly these stones are put into the
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.000]   building, in whom he also are built together, says Paul, for inhabitation of God.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.440]   In Ephesians he says, yes, you have been brought into this building, you are parts of the fabric
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   now.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.920]   You are parts of this great temple that is being built in the Lord for inhabitation of
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.600]   God through the Spirit.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.000]   Now a very important question for our consideration is this.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.880]   When does this preparation take place?
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:40.680]   Now I say that we have got to remember that primarily and most essentially this preparation
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.920]   takes place before we are ever in the Church at all.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.840]   We can never be parts of this edifice.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:57.200]   We can never be stones in these walls without our being already prepared.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.440]   Now let us go back therefore to that verse which I read in the reading at the beginning
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.240]   last Sunday but which I had not time to expand.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:15.040]   I am going to read to you 1 Kings 6, 7, the seventh verse in the sixth chapter of the
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.440]   first book of Kings.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:25.280]   Listen to this, "And the house when it was in building was built of stone, made ready
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.920]   before it was brought thither, so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.480]   iron heard in the house while it was in building."
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.240]   Now that is a part of the account of the building of Solomon's temple.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.880]   It is a very important bit of history this.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.960]   There it is in that first book of Kings.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.440]   Indeed as we are studying this particular section, it is of great importance that we
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.680]   should go back to the Old Testament and read there about the building of the tabernacle
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.920]   in the wilderness and also the building of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.800]   There is no doubt at all that the apostle Paul here had those very pictures in his mind.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.320]   And it is equally clear that what is instructed with regard to the building of the old temple
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.600]   has relevance to what we are considering at this moment.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   You remember how when God instructed Moses to build the tabernacle, he took him up into
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.800]   a mountain and he gave him detailed instructions.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.260]   God did not just say to Moses, "Now I want you to build a tabernacle for me in which
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.560]   my presence can dwell, in which my Shekinah glory can appear."
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.640]   No, no.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.800]   He gave him detailed measurements, he told him the color of the material, everything
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   was given in detail, and then having given him the plans and specifications, God said
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   to Moses, "See that thou make all things according to the patterns shown thee in the
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.800]   mount."
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.560]   And exactly the same thing happened with Solomon.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.600]   Therefore I say it is important for us to bear this in mind.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   It has a very deep significance.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.720]   Listen to it again.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:27.560]   And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone, made ready before it was brought
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:35.320]   thither, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.840]   house while it was in building.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.400]   Now there, I say, is very important doctrine, and it is a vital part of the exposition of
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.000]   this statement of the apostle here with regard to the nature of the Christian church.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.440]   What does it mean?
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.680]   Well the first principle, it seems to me, is this.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.440]   There is a secret aspect of this work.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.520]   This preparation is done in secret.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.840]   There were people there undoubtedly in Jerusalem watching the building and the erection of
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.280]   the temple, but they did not see the preparation of the stones.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.880]   That was something that had been done before the stones were brought to Jerusalem at all
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.920]   and put into their positions in the wall.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:38.080]   Now here, of course, is a great New Testament principle.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.520]   Before any of us can be truly members of the Christian church, and you see the importance
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.080]   of distinguishing here between the mere having of our names upon a church roll and really
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:13:03.880]   being members of Christ and of his church, a mighty work of preparation is essential.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:14.080]   It is a work that is done by the Holy Spirit, and it is done in the depths of the soul.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.280]   And it is indeed a very mysterious work, and a very secret work.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.520]   The world knows nothing about it.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.200]   Like the people in Jerusalem knew nothing about the preparation of these stones, so
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.280]   the world knows nothing at all about this.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.680]   I mean by that that it is possible for us to be working in an office with people or
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.800]   even living in the same home with people, and this mighty work of preparation is going
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.720]   on and they know nothing about it.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.600]   It isn't something done externally, outwardly, superficially.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.520]   It's a work that is done in the vitals of the soul.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.080]   The apostle in writing to the Corinthians puts it like this, that we are epistles of
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:10.400]   Christ written not with ink and not upon tablets of stone, but written, he says, with the spirit
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.320]   of the living God upon the fleshy tables of the heart.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.040]   That's it.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:24.660]   It's an internal work, a mysterious work, which goes on in that part of man which is
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.080]   called the soul.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.400]   Now you remember a famous anatomist scoffing a few years ago about the soul.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.040]   He said that he'd dissected so many bodies in the dissecting room, but he'd never come
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.200]   across an organ called the soul.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.360]   Of course he hadn't.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.160]   That's one of the secret things that a mere anatomist cannot understand.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.440]   Still less could he understand the work of the spirit, therefore, in the soul.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.260]   You know, my friends, this work is as secret as this, that the man himself on whom the
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:04.880]   work's being done sometimes doesn't know what's happening.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.200]   The spirit of God deals with us some time before we come to a realization of what is
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   happening.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.960]   All we know is that we're being caused to ask various questions which we've never asked
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.920]   before.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.880]   All we know is that we suddenly become dissatisfied with ourselves and with our lives, and we
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   don't know why.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.240]   Somebody else may say that we are not well, perhaps we ought to go and see a doctor.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:35.160]   We may agree, we may think that we're tired.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.860]   It's a mysterious work.
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:45.440]   New interests seem to arise, new longings and desires and aspirations, and we say, "What
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.920]   is this?
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.400]   I don't understand myself.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.480]   Something seems to be happening to me.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.760]   I'm not as I was.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   What is it?
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.520]   Things are just dropping off, as it were, and we don't know.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.600]   We are ignorant of this secret work of the Spirit, but it's there and it's a part of
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.760]   the preparation.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.720]   The work was done before the stones were brought to Jerusalem.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:12.320]   Not there, but there, before they were brought thither.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   I mustn't stay with this, but you remember how our Lord put it once and forever in speaking
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:25.400]   to Nicodemus, who completely failed at that point to understand this doctrine.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.080]   How can a man be born again when he is old, says Nicodemus?
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.000]   Can he enter for the second time into his mother's womb and be born?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I don't understand.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.640]   Quite right, said our Lord, in effect the wind bloweth where it listeth.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.680]   Though seest it not, thou canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.520]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.760]   You see the result.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.680]   You don't see how it happens, you don't understand.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.520]   Thou canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.800]   It's unseen, it's invisible, but you see the effects, the results, the finished product.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:17.840]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.960]   In other words, I lay it down as a fundamental proposition, and it's most important to emphasize
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:30.120]   it today, because there's such grievous misunderstanding about this.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:37.280]   To become a Christian means that we are subjected to a power and to a force that is beyond our
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   understanding.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.320]   Now, don't misunderstand that.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.840]   That does not mean to say that Christianity is irrational.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.320]   What it means is that it is super-rational, supra-rational, if you like.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.720]   No, no, there is nothing, and I delight in this and often expand this, there is nothing
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.360]   once you're inside it that is so irrational, so logical, as you have an illustration here
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.640]   in this epistle to the Ephesians, as the Christian faith.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.040]   But if you're outside it, you don't understand it.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.880]   There seems to be something mysterious and almost odd.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880]   Why?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.760]   Well, because it's God's work, because it is the direct action of the Eternal.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.520]   He's no longer acting through the laws of nature.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.240]   He's acting directly.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.920]   He is acting immediately.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:36.080]   Well, let me again call upon the great apostle to expound himself.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.480]   He puts it like this in the first epistle to the Corinthians and in the second chapter.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.400]   He says that when the Lord Jesus Christ was in this world, the princes of this world didn't
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.520]   recognize him.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.080]   He says, "For had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.680]   They saw but a man, but a carpenter of Nazareth."
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.280]   They said, "Who is this fellow?"
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.040]   They were rather amazed at his knowledge and his learning, but they didn't fathom, they
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:11.320]   didn't understand, they didn't know he was the Son of God.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:17.080]   But the apostle says, "The Spirit hath revealed them unto us.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.980]   The Spirit which searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.280]   He goes on, "For we have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:36.380]   that is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God."
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.040]   He says, "The natural mind receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:49.320]   are foolishness unto him, neither can he, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:59.400]   He then adds this, he says, "He that is spiritual," that's the spiritual man, "judgeth all things,
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.980]   yet he himself is judged of no men."
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:10.840]   In other words, by definition, a Christian should be a problem and an enigma to every
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.800]   person who's not a Christian.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.640]   And you see, my friends, how important this is as a test for all of us this morning.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.760]   If a man who's not a Christian can understand you quite well, and all that you do and all
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.440]   you say, well, to that extent, I say you're not a Christian.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.680]   The Son of God, when he was in this world, was a great problem to people.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.760]   They said, "Who is this?
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.440]   He's an ordinary man, he's never been trained as a Pharisee, he's not one of the scribes,
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.080]   he's not a priest, he's never had the learning and the teaching, yet look at him, listen
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   to what he's saying, he seems to know, look at his miracles, who is this?"
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.880]   He was a problem and a puzzle to them.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.440]   And you remember in the early chapters of the book of Acts, we are told the same was
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:06.120]   true of his followers, Peter and John healed the men at the beautiful gate of the temple,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.880]   and if they couldn't understand it, they put them on trial, and this is all they could
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.120]   say about them, that these men had been with Jesus, that's all they knew.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.960]   Ignorant men, unlearned men, yet filled with power, what is this?
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:29.400]   Well, that is, this secret aspect of this work, this preparation, the Christian, because
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:38.440]   he is one who has been formed and fashioned by the Holy Spirit, is a man whom no one can
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.480]   understand except another Christian.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:51.560]   Here it is, I say, not irrational, but beyond reason, confirming that profound dictum of
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:59.880]   Blaise Pascal, the supreme achievement of reason, is to bring us to see that there is
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.120]   a limit to reason.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:09.520]   Here we are in a realm where God acts immediately and directly.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.120]   So you see, a Christian is not merely a man who decides to take up a number of propositions
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.880]   and a point of view or to espouse a philosophy.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:27.280]   A Christian, by definition, is one who has been formed and fashioned and brought into
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:37.760]   shape and made fit and meet to be a stone in this wall, in this edifice, which is going
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:44.320]   up as a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.840]   A Christian is a man who has been born again, changed, renewed, regenerated—those are
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.320]   the New Testament terms—he is a new creation.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:06.360]   But now that brings me to a second principle, which is, again, to emphasize that all this
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:12.680]   must happen to us before we can become a part of the Church.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:18.480]   You see, our fundamental text there in 1 Kings 6, 7, brings that out above everything else.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.120]   The house, when it was in building, was built of stone, made ready before it was brought
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.440]   thither.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.560]   That's it.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:34.440]   Now, let me put this in this form.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.480]   We are not in the Church in order to become Christians.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.080]   We are in the Church because we are Christians.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.680]   The reason for becoming a member of a Church is not that you may eventually become a Christian,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.440]   I say.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.120]   It is because you are already one.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:06.640]   The Church was never meant to be a mixed multitude of those who are Christians and those who
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:13.360]   hope they are Christians, of those who hope they may become Christians, and of those who
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:22.440]   are there just because they have never even thought enough to stop coming, and who are
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   mere traditionalists.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:31.560]   Now, this again, of course, is a tremendously important point, and again especially at this
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:42.280]   present time with all this consideration of this question of union and reunion and unity.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.200]   And I do believe, and I think you will all agree, that therefore it is important for
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.520]   us to consider what has been taught in the past concerning these matters.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.400]   Now, at the time of the Protestant Reformation, of course, this became a very urgent and a
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.200]   crucial matter.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:09.640]   Martin Luther taught that the Church is the community of believers.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.160]   John Calvin put his emphasis in this way.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.840]   He said the Church consists of the total number of the elect.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.640]   You notice the emphasis?
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:29.800]   Community of believers, the total number of the elect, the chosen, the called out.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:36.960]   And you remember that the Puritans, who in a sense were the originators and the founders
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:45.040]   of what are called the free churches, the first Independents, the first Baptists and
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:51.680]   others, they put their emphasis upon what they called the "gathered church."
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:58.080]   Now, what they meant was this, that the Church rarely consists of the gathering together
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:05.440]   or the meeting together of saints, of believers.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:13.240]   You see, they rejected totally and completely the idea of a state church, because according
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.800]   to the state church idea, everybody who lives in a parish is a member of the Church and
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.320]   a Christian.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:27.680]   Now, nonconformity, the free churches, rejected that completely.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.800]   They said because a man happens to live in a parish, he's not a Christian.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.400]   Because people happen to live in this country, they're not Christians.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:41.360]   "No, no," they said, "the Church consists only of those who have been prepared, the
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:48.200]   born again, the regenerated, the renewed, the saints, the believers, God's people.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.920]   And the Church is the gathering together of these.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.960]   That's the Church, the gathered people."
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:07.440]   Now, you see the importance and the relevance of all this at this present time.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.420]   When there is a tendency to become looser and looser and vaguer and vaguer in definitions,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.360]   and to say that all who call themselves Christians must be regarded as Christians, and that we're
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.120]   all one, and so on and so forth.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.900]   Indeed, it is even suggested that we shouldn't bring in the term "Christian" even.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.000]   We have a congress of world faiths.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.600]   Anybody who believes anyhow in God, that we're all one, over against those who don't believe
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   in God.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.440]   Now it's vital that we should consider all that, not only in the light of history, but
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.600]   still more in the light of Scripture.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:48.160]   This Scripture and that statement in 1 Kings 6, 7.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.120]   In other words, Charlie, the teaching of the Scriptures is perfectly plain and clear.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:28:01.760]   And I can put it like this, the Church consists only of those who believe the true doctrine
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.440]   and who live a corresponding life.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.280]   The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.700]   The Lord knoweth them that are his, and let them that name the name of the Lord depart
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.700]   from iniquity.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.400]   There are some who are denying the faith, says Paul to Timothy.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   They're denying the resurrection.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.040]   They say, "It's already passed."
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.160]   "It's all right," he says, "don't you be troubled."
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.300]   They seem to men to be Christian.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.400]   God has always known where they were.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.920]   He knows all things.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.400]   His foundation standeth sure.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.920]   He cannot deny himself, though we may deny him.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.760]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.640]   He ultimately is the architect of the Church.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:53.040]   Very well, then we can go on to put it like this, that surely there is nothing which is
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:59.120]   quite so fatal, therefore, when we are thinking about the Church as to think in terms of size
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.040]   and of numbers, which is the controlling thought today.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.760]   "World Church," they say.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.080]   They say the only way to fight Communism and these other things that are opposed to Christianity
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.800]   is that we all become one.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.960]   We mass our great battalions, then we'll stand up to the enemy.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.880]   Oh, how utterly unscriptural it is.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.520]   We've just been singing in our hymn about the faithful few, and the Bible is full of
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.560]   a doctrine of the remnant.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.760]   No, no, God doesn't work through big battalions.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.400]   He's not interested in numbers.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:44.120]   He's interested in purity, in holiness, a vessel that is fit and meet for the Master's
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.800]   use.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:57.320]   We must concentrate not on numbers, but upon doctrine, upon regeneration, upon holiness,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:07.200]   upon the realization that this is a holy temple in the Lord, a habitation of God.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.480]   And you see, this is taught by the Lord himself.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:19.800]   You sometimes, as you read the Gospels, almost get the impression that the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.640]   spent a great deal of his time in refusing people.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.080]   We today press people to decisions.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.800]   We do all we can just to grab at them, as it were, and draw them in, willy-nilly.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.080]   This is how our Lord behaved.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.240]   A man came running after him and said, "Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.360]   What a wonderful addition to the Church.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:47.400]   Yes, but our Lord turned to that man and said, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.920]   have nests, but the Son of Man hath not whereon to lay his head.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.160]   Go and think about what you're doing," says our Lord.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.040]   "I don't want this excitement.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:03.080]   I want you to realize what it may cost you."
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.960]   And you remember, he goes on to speak to a man who asks that he may first of all go home
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.320]   and bury his father.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.400]   He said, "Let the dead bury the dead."
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:19.280]   Oh, a man having laid his hand to the plough and looking back, he is fit for this kingdom.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.400]   He tests, he seems to be rejecting, he examines, "Count the cost," he says.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.920]   What a foolish man, he says, is a man who starts building a castle, but hasn't first
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.280]   computed how much he'll need and whether he has the ability and the wealth to go on with
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.280]   it.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.960]   Or a man who sets out in a war against another country and doesn't know his number of troops
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   and reserves.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:47.360]   "Oh, the folly of that," he says, "stop, consider," he seems to be rejecting.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:56.280]   He was concerned about the purity of the church, not the size, not the number.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:02.080]   And when he left the world, he left but a handful of ordinary ignorant, untutored, illiterate
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   men.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.200]   That's his method.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:13.560]   And you know, it's always been like that in every period of revival and of reawakening.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:21.480]   It was an extremely difficult thing to become a member of the Puritan church.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   You go back and read the trust deeds of the foundation of the first independent and Baptist
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:34.120]   churches, you'll find it was an excessively difficult thing to obtain admission to membership.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:41.220]   Have you ever read the rules that John Wesley drew up for admission into his societies?
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.040]   How men were examined and tested in doctrine and in life.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.360]   You see, it's when that sort of thing happens you get revival.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   God can only dwell in a pure church, not a large church, but a pure church, pure in doctrine,
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.720]   pure in life.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:07.600]   It may sound a surprising thing to you, but I have no hesitation in asserting, even today,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   the greatest trouble with the church today is that she's too big.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:20.560]   It's the mixed multitude.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:29.960]   It is only when there are vessels fit and meet for the Master's use that he uses them.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:39.760]   It is only when it is a holy temple that the eternal resident comes in.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:46.280]   The whole teaching of the Scripture is to this effect, and it is substantiated and supported
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:53.800]   and proved by the subsequent history of the Christian church.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:02.160]   It is still true to say that no one knows, the world doesn't know, what God can do with
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:10.920]   one man that is completely committed to him.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.360]   All great revivals and reformations have come from the most insignificant beginnings.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:26.320]   One man, Martin Luther, odd individuals in the seventeenth century, the little holy club
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.040]   in Oxford in the eighteenth century, it's always been that.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.520]   My dear friends, let's cease to think in terms of big business when we are talking
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.360]   about the church.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.520]   Let's come back to the New Testament.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.420]   It's a holy temple in the Lord.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:52.240]   When he comes in with one feeble man, he can convict thousands.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:58.040]   Through the preaching of the Apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost, three thousand were
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.800]   truly added to the church.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:10.360]   Well, let me go on to my final principle for this morning, which is this, that there is
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.320]   to be no noise during this building process.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.840]   Go back again to 1 Kings 6-7, and this is how it puts it.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.480]   And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone, made ready before it was brought
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   thither, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.440]   house while it was in building.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.720]   Oh, what a vital principle this is.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:53.400]   Being interpreted and put into its modern dress, it's this, there should be no discussion
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:00.760]   and no debate and no disagreement in the church about vital truths.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:08.400]   There's to be none of this noise of chiseling and hammering and forming and preparation
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.000]   in the church.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.640]   That happens before you come into the church.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.120]   There should be no discussion in the Christian church as to the person of the Lord Jesus
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.240]   Christ.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.640]   There should be no discussion in the church as to the position and the condition of man
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.520]   in sin.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:43.680]   There should be no discussion in the church as to the substitutionary atonement and regeneration
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:52.960]   and the person of the Spirit and the element of grace supreme.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.000]   There must be no noise of discussion about these things.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.360]   All that has happened beforehand.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:08.240]   Now, let's be clear about this because, again, this can be quite misunderstood.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:14.800]   When I say that there should be no discussion and noise of debate in the church, I do not
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:20.880]   mean that the church should not be interested in doctrine.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.160]   I mean that the doctrine should be agreed upon beforehand and already so that there
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.760]   is no longer any need of discussion.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.400]   But you see, that is being misunderstood today and it's put in this form.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.080]   Ah, they say, we mustn't have any discussions about doctrine.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.440]   They always divide.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.760]   Therefore, because these things divide, let's not have them and let's therefore all agree
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.040]   to call one another Christians, whatever we may believe.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.480]   One man may say that Jesus of Nazareth was only a man.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.600]   The other says, no, he was son of God as well.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.300]   They say, well, what's it matter really?
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.360]   After all, we can all agree about his teaching that it was very noble and very elevating
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.120]   and that if we all only practiced it, well, you wouldn't have this, that and the other
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.200]   in the various parts of the world today.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.560]   So they say, let's stop arguing about his person and then about the death on the cross.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.400]   One man says it's just the greatest crime in history, the supreme tragedy of all time.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.280]   Another says, no, no, God sent him to die.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.240]   He died according to the predetermined counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.880]   He died in order that he might bear the guilt of our sins and if he hadn't, we are yet in
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.400]   our sins.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:40.440]   But the tendency today is to say, it doesn't matter what you say.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.840]   The death of Christ, after all, is very wonderful and very moving.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.880]   Therefore, we can all look at it.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.600]   We can interpret it in different ways.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   It doesn't matter.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.960]   We all believe in him and we're all trying to be like him and to follow him.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.940]   We're all Christians, therefore, let's carry on.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:03.920]   You see, my friends, that's the absence of doctrine.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.000]   But what we are taught here is the exact opposite of that.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.680]   There should be no noise of this debate and discussion in the church, not because there
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:20.920]   is no doctrine, but because we're all agreed about the doctrine, because we are all subscribing
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   to it.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.640]   Now listen to it, how it happened in the early church.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:32.160]   When was it that the Holy Spirit descended upon them?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:39.500]   It was when they were all of one accord in the upper room, one accord.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:46.340]   Again we read about his coming upon them and they were all of one heart and of one mind.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:52.400]   The early church, we are told, continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, teaching, and
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.680]   fellowship and breaking of bread and prayer.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.720]   There was no noise of discussion and debate.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.720]   Why?
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   They all agreed.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.480]   They knew he was the Son of God.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.560]   The resurrection had proved it to them.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.080]   He had expounded the Scriptures.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.800]   He had explained his death.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.520]   They'd all sat at his feet and they believed the doctrine.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.600]   They were all of one accord.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   No noise.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   Why?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:24.320]   Because they'd agreed on doctrine, not because they're abiding doctrine.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.880]   And don't you see why the church is as she is today?
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.760]   What's been happening in the Christian church for the last hundred years?
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.240]   Well, more or less, it's just been this very thing.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:45.320]   It is the church that has been arguing about fundamental doctrines.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.480]   Why are the vast majority of churches almost empty today?
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.000]   Why are the figures going down from year to year?
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   I'll tell you.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.440]   It's the church herself that's responsible.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.280]   Fifty years ago here in London, the whole church was debating about what was called
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.240]   the New Theology.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.680]   What was it about?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.640]   About the person of Christ.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.960]   Was he really the eternal Son of God or was he only a man?
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   Those were the questions.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.320]   They were arguing about foundations, about the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.760]   They didn't believe it.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.680]   There was noise in the church arguing about fundamentals.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.080]   Is it surprising that the church has become ineffective and that she doesn't count and
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:34.600]   that men are not saved and that the Spirit is not operating?
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:44.840]   There is to be no noise of hammer or of axe or of any tool of iron in the church.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:50.040]   Men and women are to be clear upon these things before they come into the church.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:58.960]   Indeed, you cannot be in the church truly except you are already right about these matters.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.000]   What is the church for?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.480]   Well, the Christian church was never meant to be a cockpit in which men argue and fight
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:15.520]   and debate and wrangle about the vital matters of Christ and his work, not at all.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:24.760]   The church is the gathering of those for whom these matters have been settled once and forever,
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:32.080]   who know whom they have believed, who know what they believe, who are on the foundation
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.360]   of God, and who all come together, what for?
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:43.880]   Not to argue and debate about these things, but to wait upon him, to worship him that
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:50.240]   he may come amongst them, that he may fill them with his own presence and with joy unspeakable
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.400]   and full of glory, and who may fill them with power to speak to others and to spread the
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:05.400]   good news and to win men from the shackles and the bondage of sin.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.160]   You notice what I am saying?
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.720]   I am not saying that Christian people should agree absolutely about every detail.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.760]   I am emphasizing the fundamentals.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:23.080]   There are certain irrelevant matters about which all Christians are not agreed, certain
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.280]   matters about prophecy, certain matters like the mode of baptism, and many others.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:35.400]   I say those are not foundation principles.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:41.800]   Christian people are never to wrangle and to quarrel and to fight even about them.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.200]   They discuss them as brethren.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:51.560]   But I am asserting that there is to be even no discussion about fundamentals, because
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.040]   they are fundamentals.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.940]   The preparation is to take place before the stones are brought to the church.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.920]   There is no noise here.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:10.220]   We know him as Son of God and Saviour.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:18.520]   And therefore I say that in the church, the greatest need of this hour is just to understand
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.280]   these principles.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:26.680]   But nevertheless, these great worldwide conferences are being held one after another, and do you
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.680]   know how they spend their time?
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:34.520]   Not in prayer to God, not in waiting for the Spirit, not in being filled with the Spirit.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.600]   They spend their time in trying to find a basis of agreement.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.480]   They try to find an irreducible minimum about which they are not going to disagree.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:52.960]   They spend the whole of their time on that, and the world goes from bad to worse.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:45:00.560]   They have got this fatal notion that doctrine is a cause of division.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:06.320]   For the truth is this, that nothing unites except doctrine.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.720]   And the only unity worth talking about at all is the unity of the Spirit, which produces
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:20.000]   the same belief in the same Lord, in the same faith, and in the same baptism.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.760]   It is the unity of those who are like-minded and of one accord, who have no confidence
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:38.800]   in themselves, and who rely only upon the Son of God and his perfect work on their behalf.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:44.480]   The word to the modern church, therefore, as it was the word of God to Moses of old,
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   is simply this, "See that thou make all things according to the pattern shown thee
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   in the mount, the mount of the sermon on the mount, the mount of transfiguration, the mount
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:24.320]   of Calvary, Mount Olivet, the mount of the ascension, there of the great peaks.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:30.920]   Let us, in our day and generation, whatever may happen to us, whatever the church, the
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:40.040]   visible church may say of us, whatever the world may say of us, let us build according
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.800]   to the pattern shown us in the mount.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:54.080]   Let there be no uncertainty or hesitancy or discussion or noise of debate about the contents
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:03.600]   of this second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, for there is the foundation.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:14.320]   When dead in trespasses and sins, helpless and hopeless, raised by the grace of God,
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:26.280]   saved by the blood of Christ, regenerated and renewed and joined to Christ, and made
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:34.960]   a stone in the holy temple, in the Lord, amen.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
