[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.920]   - Well, retirement homes and assisted living
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.880]   are big issues facing families across the country.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.040]   And today's question comes to us anonymously,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.440]   as do many of our questions.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.080]   what does the Bible say about retirement homes?
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.480]   Don't we as children have a responsibility
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.040]   to directly look after and provide
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.260]   for our parents in old age?
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.040]   How do retirement homes fit or not fit
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   into this calling as children of aging parents?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   - Even though the issue of how we care
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   for our aging parents is not addressed specifically
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.620]   in the Bible, I think,
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.240]   that is the details of how to do it are not addressed.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.520]   There are enough pointers in God's word
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.520]   that I think any Christian child with aging parents
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.680]   who is deeply, any child who's deeply formed
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.680]   by the scriptures and eager to magnify Christ
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.640]   by his behavior, and those are two huge assumptions
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120]   'cause there aren't many people like that in the world,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.120]   will lean very strongly toward a close
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.720]   and caring relationship with his parents or her parents.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.160]   Close, direct, like this anonymous person
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.960]   was asking, let me mention some texts
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.800]   that deal with a couple of,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.160]   and then deal with a couple of practical issues.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.360]   Philippians 2, three through eight
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.240]   is one of the most transforming passages in the Bible
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.920]   if it takes root in our lives.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.360]   It stresses becoming a kind of person
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.600]   who is oriented on what others need,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.760]   not just on our private desires.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.480]   This is the great issue of life.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.320]   Will we be selfish or will we be servants?
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.200]   The beautiful life, the Christ-honoring, Christ-like life
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800]   is the life of serving others,
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.000]   not ignoring others or using others
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.320]   while we just go about our self-satisfied way.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.600]   So here's the text.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.920]   Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.000]   but in humility, count others.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.480]   Now, that would include parents.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680]   Count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.480]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests,
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.880]   but also to the interests of others, that is aging parents.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.920]   Have this mind among yourselves,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160]   which is yours in Christ Jesus,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.720]   who though he was in the form of God
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.680]   did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.560]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.520]   So he stoops from being the king of the universe
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.160]   to being a servant,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.800]   being born in the likeness of man,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.240]   being found in human form,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.240]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.520]   to the point of death, even death on the cross.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.040]   That is one of the most convicting,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.400]   one of the most beautiful,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.640]   one of the most transforming texts in the Bible.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.720]   So the great mark of the Christian, Paul says,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   the adult Christian child,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   they look not just to their own interests in midlife
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.480]   as their careers reach their capstone.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.720]   They look towards the interests of others,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.360]   including aging parents.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.400]   They count others like their parents
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   as more significant than themselves.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   They don't sit atop some pinnacle of privilege,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.000]   but like Jesus, they come down to where the need is
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.240]   and serve even unto death.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.600]   So there's a basic principle and a call in it.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.000]   Now, Jesus linked that love command with parents
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.120]   by putting them side by side in Matthew 19, 9.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.040]   He said, "Honor your father and mother
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.840]   and love your neighbor as you love yourself."
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.320]   So one way of honoring your parents
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.120]   is to love them as you love yourself.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.440]   That is, if you would hope to be helped in your aging need,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.640]   then help your parents.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.680]   One of the most beautiful examples of this,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.240]   and I think it's very inspiring,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.880]   so I'll mention it, is John 19, 26.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   In spite of Jesus' unspeakable sufferings on the cross,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.040]   he did exactly what Paul said,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   namely, he looked not to his own interests or his own pain.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.520]   He looked to his mother's.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.120]   He was the eldest son of Mary,
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.560]   and Joseph evidently was gone now.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.000]   He never shows up
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.640]   after his initial appearance in the Gospels.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.880]   And custom would dictate that the firstborn
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.760]   take special responsibility for his mom in her old age.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.560]   And so he looks down from the cross,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.080]   and it says, "When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.200]   whom he loved, John, standing nearby,
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.040]   he said to his mother, 'Woman, behold your son.'
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.760]   And then he said to his disciple, 'Behold your mother.'
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own home."
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.040]   Sometimes ministry, like dying for Jesus,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.720]   or for God in this case, in Jesus' case,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.840]   sometimes ministry will keep us
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.480]   from being as closely involved with their parents
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.280]   as we might like,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.200]   but we will be very diligent not to neglect them,
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.000]   but make sure they're cared for.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   1 Timothy 5, 4 is probably the most to the point text
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.440]   in the Bible.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   It says, "If a widow has children or grandchildren,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.320]   let them first learn to show godliness
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.440]   to their own household,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   and to make some return to their parents
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   for this pleasing in the sight of God."
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.760]   Now, the context is whether the church
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.560]   or the family should care for widows.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.960]   And Paul says that the church should care for real widows,
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.440]   that is, those who don't have a family,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.080]   implying that the first and foremost responsibility
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.360]   is for the families to care for widows.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.000]   And then he gives three motives.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.840]   Let me just mention them.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.800]   Number one, he says, "Show godliness."
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   In other words, caring for the parent is a Godward act.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.720]   It's not just social welfare.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.520]   This is part of what God is working in his people.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.400]   Number two, "To make some return to their parents."
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.080]   In other words, it's right and good for children
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.160]   to look back on all the years
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.800]   of what their parents gave to them.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   10,000 needs were met in their early years
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.480]   by the parents and feel some sense of indebtedness to them.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.800]   And number three, "For this is pleasing in the sight of God."
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   So we're told plainly, God delights,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   he's pleased when children care for their aging parents.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.640]   So the main issue is, is the heart of the children
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.480]   a selfish heart or a servant heart?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.600]   Are we ready to make sacrifices for our parents
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.240]   or are we resentful that they are becoming a burden?
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.960]   That's the real test.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.440]   All of this may or may not mean
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.960]   that the parents come to live with us or near us.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.000]   There are innumerable variables
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.360]   that make one situation right for one family
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.480]   and another situation right for another.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.320]   Here's just one tiny illustration.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.760]   My father finally needed more care
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.600]   than he could get living by himself.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.640]   Both, he had been married to my mother,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.000]   then she died and then he was married another 25 years
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.800]   and she died and now he's a widower
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.720]   and now he can't live alone anymore.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.680]   He's too forgetful,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.960]   he can't find his way home in the car anymore.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.720]   Now I'm a thousand miles away.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.360]   He was in Greenville, South Carolina,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.680]   I'm here in Minneapolis.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.880]   I have a sister nearby, none of us is right there.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.600]   Noelle and I discussed what it would mean
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.200]   to have him live with us.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.520]   We looked where the bathroom is on the first floor,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.200]   we saw the room we used for a study
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.480]   and we thought, now that could be made a bedroom,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.720]   it has immediate access to the bathroom,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   he wouldn't have to climb any steps.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.800]   Are we willing?
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.640]   We are willing.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.960]   So I said to my father,
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.400]   "Daddy, we would be happy for you
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.160]   "to spend your last days with us."
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.920]   And he wouldn't do it.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.160]   He didn't wanna leave the South,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.440]   he didn't like the weather,
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.400]   he didn't wanna leave his friends,
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.760]   he thought Beverly, my sister, was nearby.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.040]   There was a nursing home that was operated
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.200]   by the university that he graduated from,
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.040]   he had all these reasons why it was not a good idea
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.200]   to come live with his son.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.000]   And I thought, "Well, okay."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.280]   And that's the way he was.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.840]   I mean, he was not that closely tied
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.160]   and so he spent his last years in a nursing home,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.040]   Beverly visited him often
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.120]   and I got down there as often as I could
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.400]   and as his memory faded away,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.960]   he seemed quite happy in that place.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.400]   So again, the main issue for the Christian child
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.640]   of aging parents is not the precise circumstances,
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.760]   the main issue is, are we servants or are we selfish?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.840]   Are we ready to sacrifice and trust God
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.200]   with the joy to meet every need?
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.680]   Those are some very important and helpful categories
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.520]   to think through.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.240]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.480]   And thanks for listening to this podcast.

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.600]   You can reach us by email with a difficult question
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.040]   you may be facing in life.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.160]   Do all of that through our online home
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.080]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.760]   Well, Christ is free, gloriously free.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.280]   And Christ will cost you everything that you have.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.400]   So which is it?
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   Is he free or does he cost us everything?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.720]   Or are both of those things true?
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.640]   That's tomorrow's question from a young leader
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.960]   who listens to the podcast
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.120]   and wants to be faithful to both truths
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.320]   and to preach them well.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.520]   And he'll ask Pastor John how to balance that.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.480]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.680]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
