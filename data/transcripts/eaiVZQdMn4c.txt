[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   what are some ways of doing exercises in the gym that can potentially facilitate our ability to move
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.880]   better outside of the gym first let's look at the kinetics of sprinting sprinting is only really
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.120]   truly about four things how much force you apply in the ground how fast can you apply it the
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.900]   direction in which you apply it and how heavy you are and it's just those four things how much force
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.540]   how fast which direction what is your mass so we need to yeah force is important we have to be able
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.200]   to apply a certain level of force but there's a threshold to this everyone says there's a big
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.360]   question and has been for a long time how much strength quote-unquote is enough in sprinting
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.900]   well enough is it's the same question that we ask we should ask in every task there's a rate of
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.800]   diminishing returns on all of these capacities that we need that we require is spending an extra few
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.560]   years trying to get an extra five kilos to your power clean or an extra 25 pounds to your back squat
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.260]   as effective as a means to get faster than it would be if you say you start skipping maybe do some more
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.100]   explosive work actually start sprinting a little bit more so there's always this um from a programming
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.920]   perspective is understanding where the athlete is what they require what they've got where they are
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.620]   in the rate of diminishing returns on each of those capacities so first we have to understand that
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.940]   um let me zoom out just a little bit i coach andre andre degrasse as we talked about andre when i
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.840]   started coaching him in 2015 could barely squat his body weight eight months later he's three-time
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.460]   olympic medalist eight months later he was one and a half years into his sprinting career
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.540]   he'd sprinted for 18 months he had three olympic medals in the sprints the 100 the 200 and the four
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.520]   by one he could barely squat his body weight he could clean 60 kilos so 135 pounds he definitely couldn't
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   bench a plate and a half he might have had 145 pound plate uh bench yeah maybe super weak but on the other
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.720]   end of the spectrum this is the example that everyone gives you've got ben johnson famously ben johnson did
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:31.240]   the 600 pound squat a couple of days prior to winning in the tokyo olympics in 1988 running 979 obviously that
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.920]   was thereafter taken away after he tested positive so you've gone on one end of the spectrum somebody
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.120]   like ben johnson who applies incredibly incredible amounts of force and on the other end you've got
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.520]   somebody like andre degrasse who doesn't apply relatively any force but does it really really fast
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.640]   so this gives you like an understanding of the spectrum of capacities and abilities that humans have
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.200]   to do a task in an almost infinite number of ways so to get to your question it depends on who you are
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.560]   and what you're good at and why you're good at it there's not one way when you've got a ben johnson who
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.640]   can apply incredible amounts of forces and that's one of the reasons why he's fast on the other end of
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.760]   the spectrum you've got andre degrasse who's weaker than most high school girls who's incredible fat
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.200]   incredibly fast where does that leave us that just tells us okay there's many different ways to do this
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   which is great it's cool that gives us again some freedom to better ask the questions about what it
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   is that makes you andrew really good like you apply a lot of force okay let's lean into that let's try to
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.080]   improve your speed by try to maximize your force but what are you limited by okay you're having trouble
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.600]   getting off the ground you're not super reactive or reflexive so we have to work some things into your
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.640]   program that's going to make you a little bit more reactive or reflexive so maybe we'll do some jump
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.920]   squats maybe we'll do some hurdle hops maybe we'll do some more skipping maybe maybe we feel like okay
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.240]   you've reached the rate of diminishing returns on your force capacity you don't need to squat four plates
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.920]   if you squat 385 is going from 385 to 405 gonna make you any faster no not at all so let's keep you at 385 and
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.560]   we'll just do some other things so first and foremost it's respecting the individuality of all things and
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.880]   understanding that there's not one way in which i can tell you do this because this is what he did and
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.920]   that's what's going to work for you now there is as i said before there's non-negotiables and there's rules to things
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:44.120]   so sprinting is how you transmit that force into the track in a really fast period of time in the
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.400]   right direction so the transmission of force is typically more important than the magnitude of
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:58.360]   the force and at least at the elite end at least at the adult end so transmission of force means
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   how the the amount of force that you put into the ground how do you use it to propel yourself forward so
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.320]   what are the types of exercises that maybe what would what would you think about if i said this
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.080]   is a force transmission exercise rather than say a force magnitude exercise is that something that
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:24.840]   appeals to you yeah jump squat comes to mind you know um jump squat comes to mind um any kind of uh
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:33.560]   like push clap push-ups um you know the ability to like yep double clap or you know or more um
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.000]   yes that's what comes to mind that's pretty accurate olympic lifts is one is one that where
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.520]   a lot of people would say yes olympic lift that's kind of what we're doing with like a clean you're
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.560]   kind of yeah i'm not in i don't do olympic lifts but from what i understand i you know they're they're
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.040]   pushing off the ground to get get the bar up yeah it's it's essentially can we apply high forces
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.000]   fast over a long period of time so that's kind of we do we spend a lot of time looking at those
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.280]   types of exercises sled work uh we don't do any sled work i'll be all about we could get back to that if
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.360]   you know sled work for elite sprinter we don't we do resisted acceleration work so we'll sprint we'll do
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.960]   some specific strength work where we're pulling uh you know probably in excess of 10 to 15 kilos
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.440]   you know so 20 to 30 pounds ish do you use the parachute that was a big thing a few years back
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.360]   remember that when i like the parachute i used the parachute 20 years ago absolutely we don't know
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.480]   we we uh we actually have a we have a piece of equipment called the power cord we use that i use
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.200]   that that's really good spring-loaded and the 1080 sprint which is this uh incredible piece of
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.800]   equipment that we use that we can really dial in the resistance down to like you know a half a kilo
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.520]   that's it's beautiful so we use that but that's for different reasons so the you talked about the weight
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:56.840]   room in in the in the um the population of athletes i work with maximum strength is at the rate of
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.800]   diminishing returns already we don't spend almost any time working on that at a lower level of
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   population maybe if you're high school kid or if you're in your 20s when you're not super or if you're
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.200]   super weak just by increasing your force capacity so your ability to apply force you will get faster
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.840]   because remember what the calculation is amount of force how fast direction and body mass so it is
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:29.640]   important it just becomes less and less and less important the faster you get so it's and then it
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.400]   becomes when it's less important when the ability to produce a high magnitude of force isn't important
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.320]   what is important so then we're starting to looking at plyometric things and probably most specifically i'm
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:48.680]   looking at specific isometric stuff in the weight room so let's look at the position in which we're
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   applying in excess of five times our body weight and that's when the foot is directly underneath the
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:02.680]   center mass the foot is flat on the ground there's about a 15 degree knee bend and there's about a
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.640]   five to ten degree hip bend so if you can you think of think about that position so we're pushing up against
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:17.800]   in a movable bar or holding a very very heavy bar on one leg with as heavy as we can or as hard as we can
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.520]   for somewhere between three to five seconds times three to four repetitions and we'll do like three sets of
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:30.440]   that that's alex notero's work he's one of the the premier researchers in what's called run specific
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:37.880]   isometric strength training so it's getting strong in really specific positions to the task that you're
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.480]   trying to become better at so that's that's the primary one for me is that position where the foot
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.760]   is directly underneath the center mass there's a little bit of a knee bend there's a little bit of
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:55.800]   a hip bend and we do a lot of isometric work right there that's that's and then i and this is my bias i do
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:05.080]   nothing bilateral at all you mean parallel stance parallel stance nothing except occasionally if it
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:11.000]   is an issue you know with neural drive or whatever i'll do some uh trap bar deadlifts so some parallel
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.320]   stance trap bar deadlifts because i think it's a great exercise i think that's difficult to do with
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:22.520]   a staggered stance it's very difficult to do with a uh a single leg stance but you can load up some pretty
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.640]   good weight on a parallel stance trap bar deadlift and yeah i feel pretty good and you you get a good
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:34.840]   feeling out of that it's not necessarily to be um be able to apply or generate more force it's more
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.480]   about sort of neural drive than it is for anything else everything every single other thing that we do
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.240]   is in a staggered stance heel to toe or kickstand which is kind of the same same sort of thing just a
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.920]   different terminology or split stance or a stance where the front foot is elevated or the rear foot is
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:57.000]   elevated so we'll do as as we as we've talked about quite a bit now find opportunities to get the knee
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.400]   behind the butt that's a really important position can we get stronger faster more control more repeatability
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:09.080]   and more range at that position one of the things i learned from you yesterday is um well let's i'll
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.840]   double click first on this um the staggered stance so this is one foot slightly in front of the other
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.040]   um i've been doing this with various lifts in the gym for a long time i would say the exception would
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:27.080]   be if i'm belt squatting or hack squatting i don't do that um but for everything else overhead presses um
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:33.400]   anything where my feet are in contact with the ground that is uh not on pull-ups and dips of course but
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.160]   um curls tricep extensions and i make sure to vary the stance so one foot is in front for one set one is in
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.120]   run for the sometimes even in the middle of the set i'll i'll switch them up after um and i found
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.640]   that to be tremendously helpful for building core stability and a number of other things
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.160]   um and it sounds like it might help running gate as well the other thing that you said yesterday that
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.240]   i think is really important i've not thought of before but now i'm doing is anytime you have a
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.560]   foot elevated in the gym to get onto the toe front foot can be flat yeah i think the ability to get off
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:12.840]   your first ray so for the big toe to bend and flex is really important so for me if i if that's
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.760]   important i'm going to search for opportunities to do that as often as i can so if i have an option to
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:25.240]   either flex the big toe or not then we're going to flex a big toe now if you can't and many athletes
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.440]   cannot you know there's a lot of athletes that just cannot extend to that big toe or some athletes
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.520]   have bunions and just can't get over it and that's okay we can go on to the top of the foot but it's
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.200]   not the not the end of the world but i look for opportunities like that like i look for
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:45.480]   opportunities to extend the hip how can i work hip extension exercises into everything i do how do i
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:54.840]   look at or do i look for full um full chain or full body force transmission exercises as much as i possibly
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.520]   can ideally from the left foot to the right hand and the right foot to the left hand so cross body so i'm
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.720]   looking for these long fascial chains like ways in which i can bring some function to the work that
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.520]   i'm doing in the weight room some level of transferability between the things that i do in
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.920]   the weight room and the things that we do on the track because frankly most of the things that we do
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.400]   in the weight room don't transfer to the track a squat doesn't really transfer it's a totally different
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.200]   exercise performed a totally different way at a totally different time totally different weights
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.760]   so the transference is very very far it's very it's not very nebulous so i'm looking for ways in
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:38.520]   which we can find a way to transfer the capacities that we are building in the weight room directly to
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   the track and with respect to stretching i'm thinking again of yoga because this is where the probably
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.040]   the first time i've done this where one would lunge so front foot planted flat rear foot up on the big
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.200]   toe if possible the knee back of that rear foot um or rear leg excuse me back behind the butt and then
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:05.800]   the opposite arm raised above that's that fascial um sling that cuts across from you know in anatomy
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:12.840]   nomenclature contralateral across the midline um and then essentially trying to learn to feel that um
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:20.040]   line that goes all the way from one's big toe that's planting back across up the leg across the
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.120]   the pelvis up the body and shoulder to the opposite tips of finger 100 and it's it's if uh if i can add to
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:34.280]   that stretch um this is something that i really love kelly about you know he's he's so much on i
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:41.160]   need you to be in control of your body there is a way to do this but then it's up to you to find out a
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.960]   better way for you specifically so you've done a great job of outlining what the stretch looks like
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.720]   now what can i do with my body to actually make this better do i rotate to one side do i side bend to
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.800]   one side do i flex the hand as well as as well as doing this because this will be a better stretch
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:04.280]   than that so palm parallel to the to the ceiling 100 of the raised hand correct if i push the knee back
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.560]   and try to push the heel on the ground and actually contract if i rotate my pelvis underneath me
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.880]   posteriorly like you know do a a pelvic tilt underneath me well will that increase it so it's always this
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:22.360]   exploratory process there is a right way to do things but you are an individual we're all unique
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:35.880]   snowflakes right we're all move in different ways and it's up to us to explore all of our uniqueness
