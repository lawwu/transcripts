[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   these two important things, busy bandwagon, infinity pools.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.060]   Let's talk about what those are
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.680]   and how they're probably taking away our time.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.360]   - So the busy bandwagon is where
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.420]   these defaults show up in culture.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.880]   So the expectation that you say yes to every meeting,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.200]   that you should constantly monitor your email
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.080]   and respond right away, that you should be busy,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.360]   that being busy is a sign that you are a successful person.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.720]   And I think we all find ourselves either on the bandwagon
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.320]   or wishing we were on the bandwagon
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.640]   at some point in our lives.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.560]   The infinity pools, that's kind of our term
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.960]   for the places where defaults show up in our technology
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.320]   and in our media and content.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.280]   Anytime there's an infinite source of content,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.420]   there's always water in the pool.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.760]   You can always jump back in.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.420]   The bad news is that those are really irresistible.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.520]   They're very effectively designed and engineered
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.920]   and optimized to be irresistible.
