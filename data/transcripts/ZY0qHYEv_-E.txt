[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - All right, so here we go.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.580]   The next question we have,
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.600]   question about your dislike of the words
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.880]   content and content creator.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.080]   She explains more.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.160]   - Hi Cal, my name is Tina and I'm in academic medicine.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.520]   You've mentioned on the show several times
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.140]   about how you hate the word content and content creator.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.200]   I find that I don't like these terms either,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.680]   but I can't quite articulate why.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.680]   Can you explain further as to why these words
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.000]   just don't sound right,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.360]   considering your deep life and deep work philosophies?
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.640]   I'm a huge fan of the show.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   - All right, I'll be quick on this answer.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.300]   I think the content and content creator terminology,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.480]   the context in which it is often used
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.200]   is in a very sterile business technique
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.560]   optimization type context, right?
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.920]   So when you hear content creator,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.880]   you're imagining that you're gonna be watching
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.880]   a YouTube video about optimizing your subscription numbers
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.720]   for your YouTube channel or something like this.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.360]   When you think of content or content creator,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.280]   you think of people saying,
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.080]   "I want you to smash that subscribe button,
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.440]   and hit the bell."
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   And so anyways, it's sterile and business focused,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.880]   where I tend to focus more on the craft itself,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.480]   the Steve Martin advice of be so good they can't ignore you.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.240]   That you're not a content creator
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.320]   who's trying to meet a content schedule.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.960]   You're trying to instead craft a book
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.240]   that hundreds of thousands of people
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.280]   are gonna feel like changed their life.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.200]   You're not trying to optimize readership numbers.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.320]   You're trying to write an article
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.200]   that is gonna change the way a whole segment
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.440]   of the population understands an important issue.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.520]   So I like to put the focus concretely
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.680]   on the actual artistic thing you're trying to create,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.160]   and put as much energy as possible
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.680]   into making that as good as possible.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.600]   And then all the other stuff,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.960]   it comes along, but it's kind of on the side.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.740]   I mean, yeah, there's some stuff you have to do,
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.780]   but that's not the focus.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.300]   The focus is producing the good stuff.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.200]   Now, Jesse, you've been teaching me
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   about some of this stuff, right?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.520]   So you're helping me get videos online.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.200]   You will admit to the audience
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   that I know very little about YouTube or videos,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.400]   and I practice what I preach.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.960]   I do not know any content creator information.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.800]   - I'm not, I'm okay with YouTube and stuff.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   I have a channel in another field that's decent.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.460]   But all in all, yeah, I mean, I can attest to that.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.020]   See, I guess that, okay, one other,
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.660]   I don't wanna go long, because I promised to be short,
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.680]   so I'll be short here.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440]   But I think there's also a,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.980]   there but for the grace of God go I type fear I have,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.140]   which is there's a very specific job
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.340]   in the world of people who work in written
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.660]   or visual mediums, which is being a YouTube personality.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.740]   And they are really beholden to these algorithms.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.740]   I guess if you make money off of YouTube advertisements,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.820]   it really matters if your videos get recommended, right?
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.500]   I guess that's where a lot of views come from.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.860]   And there's all of these little things that matter
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.220]   for the algorithm to get your video shown more.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.700]   And obsessing about these things
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.540]   really probably makes a very practical difference
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.900]   to how much money you make.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900]   And so to me, when I see my son watching
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.420]   like Minecraft YouTubers,
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.700]   I'm like, what a hard job, man, this is a smart guy.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.100]   Like, I'm wondering if he should go to med school.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.940]   (laughs)
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.700]   I mean, because like, they have to do this all day long
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.060]   and get subscribers and this and this bell.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.080]   I don't know what the bell does,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.300]   but if they don't do this,
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.700]   it's not gonna get recommended.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.760]   If it doesn't get recommended,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.220]   they're not gonna be able to pay their heating bill
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.580]   and they have to like render videos all night long.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.740]   And like, I don't wanna do any of that.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.060]   So for me, I'm also, I think,
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.220]   just in a self-protective way,
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.820]   saying like, I don't want anything to do with that world.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.540]   I care about my books.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.580]   Like when it comes to metrics of success,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.180]   how many copies my books sell and podcast listeners.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.580]   I think downloads of the podcast is very important.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.980]   I like this medium, it's distributed, we control it.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.620]   I think it's given us a great relationship
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.740]   with the audience.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.680]   And if YouTube videos help those things, that's great.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.380]   But I really, I think once you go down that line
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.080]   of trying to serve the YouTube algorithm,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.740]   it's a Faustian bargain.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.580]   - A hundred percent.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.940]   I think the gamers, they have a tough lifestyle.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.740]   I mean, they probably don't have the best diet in the world.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.060]   They're probably not exercising that much.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.740]   Their backs probably hurt all the time.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.500]   But some of them make bank.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.780]   So I mean, as long as they're not blowing all the money,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.780]   maybe they're okay, but who knows?
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.860]   I completely agree with you though.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.960]   - Here's my counterfactual though.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.620]   Let's say we take, let's say everyone
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.020]   who in the last five years made a serious run
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.980]   and let's just focus on one game
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.660]   at a Minecraft YouTube video, right?
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.100]   Like where they're doing it almost full-time.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.140]   Now, if we took all those people
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.300]   and said almost anything else, like try writing books,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.180]   try starting a software company,
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.020]   like just get your college degree
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.700]   and try to go into banking,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.460]   I bet we'd have the same income distribution.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.540]   There'd be like a small number of people
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.560]   who made a lot of money and like some other people,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.540]   most other people, actually it would probably
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.580]   be a better distribution.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.140]   You'd have a few people that made a lot of money,
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.820]   but a lot of money would be more
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.580]   than the best YouTubers make.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.140]   And then almost everyone else would have
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.860]   at least a stable middle-class lifestyle
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.020]   where with the YouTubers, probably the curve
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.780]   is much more brutal that like 80% can't even
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.220]   pay their bills with it.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.260]   But it would be the time demands of,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.780]   I don't know, I ran a software company
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.660]   or a banker would probably be better than the worker.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.340]   I guess my counterfactual is like,
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.860]   is this actually opening up,
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.500]   'cause I don't think it's a better lifestyle.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.240]   It's a really hard job.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.500]   Is it really opening up like more
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.160]   income-making opportunities than,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.460]   these are smart kids, than other stuff they could do.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.180]   - That's probably more rational thinking
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.740]   than they went into, they probably first started
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.580]   doing it and then realized they might be able
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.620]   to make some money with it.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.020]   And then all of a sudden it was like a snowball effect.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.380]   So like people were doing it.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.300]   - And there's a tension.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.940]   - And I don't think that they would ever
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.100]   even wanna begin starting an accounting firm
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.660]   or doing some sort of thing like that
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.060]   where they have to report to work and do whatever.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.420]   - Yeah, but you could be, they're all tech savvy.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.180]   Most of these guys, I bet could build up
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.500]   pretty good computer programming skills
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   and work, I don't know, half the year on contract
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.160]   and have the other half the year completely free
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   and probably have as, maybe it's just not as much fun.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.260]   Maybe I'm not a romantic.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.180]   - Some of them might be, I think a lot of them might be.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.340]   Like my good buddy who has like an online business
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.260]   plays games all the time.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.340]   He doesn't do videos, but I mean.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
