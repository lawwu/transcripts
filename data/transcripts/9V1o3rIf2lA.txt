[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hello everyone, this is Tony and before we dive into today's episode I want to
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.720]   ask a favor from you. We love serving you on this podcast and we want to serve you
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.040]   better in 2020 and beyond and to serve you better means we need to know you
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520]   better. And to this end we put together a brief survey that takes just a few
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.240]   minutes to fill out. It'll be up online until the end of January and if you're
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.640]   willing to help us out go online to DesiringGod.org/survey
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey and I'll mention this
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.320]   address again at the end of today's episode which starts right now.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.640]   Well if this is my first read through the Bible what should I expect? So many
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.440]   great Bible reading questions arrive at the start of a new year like this one
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.320]   from a listener named Mike. "Hello Pastor John, I have been blessed by your
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.880]   ministry for many years and in the year ahead I hope to read my Bible from cover
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.720]   to cover for the very first time using the Discipleship Journal Bible reading
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.400]   plan that you use. I feel a little excited and a lot intimidated and
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.720]   enormously unprepared for the year ahead. I've never done anything like this before.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.000]   So what's your advice for me and what obstacles must I expect to overcome to
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.680]   pull this off?" Well amen and praise God for what Mike is resolving to do. I just
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.760]   what an hour and a half ago was reading my Discipleship Journal reading plan
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.280]   reading so I've been on this system for good night what 20-25 years I don't know
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   and I love this system. I try other things and I generally come back to it
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.600]   so good Mike. You should be excited and yes you should be intimidated. You are
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.920]   in significant ways unprepared. Me too. That's why we're reading. Paul said
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.240]   it's all inspired precisely to make us prepared that the man of God may be
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.760]   complete equipped or we could say prepared for every good work including
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.440]   Bible reading. So you gotta read to get prepared to read right? So that's okay to
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.840]   be intimidated by reading the Bible. So what should you expect? I'll give you
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.960]   three negatives to scare you off and ten positives to suck you back in. So number
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.400]   one negative expect opposition. Satan hates the Word of God and will disincline
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.920]   you, blind you, distract you, bore you. He will fight with all his might
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.040]   to keep this from happening. So pray and fight and ask God to make all four of
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.360]   those things that Satan tries to do to backfire to blow up in his face as you
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   become a stronger warrior against him. So your heart inclined, your blindness
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.520]   removed, focus instead of distraction, excitement instead of boredom. So that's
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.840]   expect opposition. Number two, expect to be shocked. The outrage of sin and its
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   graphic descriptions and the horrors of God judgments and the failures of God's
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.280]   people are appalling in the Bible. The Bible is stunningly graphic in its
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.040]   description both of our outrageous sin and God's breathtaking judgment on sin.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.800]   You will want to throw up if you have any kind of sympathetic engagement with
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.680]   the Bible at times when you see what God ordains against sin in this world. So
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.960]   expect your views of man and God to be blown up in a good way. Shocked. Number
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.440]   three, negative, expect to be confused for three reasons. Number one, God conceals
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.600]   many things that we'd like to know. Deuteronomy 29 29, "The secret things
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.920]   belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.120]   and to our children that we may do his word." So there are things you're gonna
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.680]   want to know and God says, "Nope, that's my business, not yours." Number two reason
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.640]   why you're gonna be confused, what he has revealed is often hard to understand.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.640]   Peter said that flat-out in 2nd Peter 3 16. As Paul does in all his letters when
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.120]   he speaks of them in these matters, there are some things in Paul's letters hard
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.760]   to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.360]   as they do the other scriptures. 2nd Peter 3 16. There are some things in
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.600]   Paul's letters that are hard to understand, which we should not expect to
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.480]   find easy. So we're gonna be confused at times. And number three reason
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.520]   why you're gonna be confused is that Christ has given teachers to the church.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.040]   Have you ever thought about that? That in the New Testament, he didn't just
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.680]   give a Bible and say, "No, we don't need any teachers because we've got the Bible,
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.440]   we've got the Holy Spirit, so no human beings need to be teachers in the
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.400]   church." He didn't do that. He said in every church there should be elders,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.320]   those elders must be apt to teach, which means people need explanations for what
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.840]   they see in the Bible, and teachers are called to figure things out and help the
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.600]   others. So just unless you're one of those teachers, and unless you're God,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.840]   you're gonna run into confusing things in the Bible that you need
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.720]   help from other people. So the implication of those three, pray for
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.600]   illumination. Do whatever digging in study helps you. Put things together that
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.760]   you can put together, and what you can't figure out, put on the shelf for later
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.400]   attention and keep on moving. If you get bogged down with what you can't
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   understand, you'll never finish the reading for the day. Those are my
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.360]   negatives, here are the ten positives. I'll just tick them off really, really
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   quickly. These are things you can expect. Number one, expect your faith to be
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.440]   deepened and strengthened, because Romans 10 17 says, "Faith comes by hearing, and
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.920]   hearing by the Word of Christ." Or almost the same, expect your hope in God to be
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.760]   made more unshakable, because Romans 15 4 says, "Everything in the whole Bible is
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.680]   written for your hope." Number two, expect God to do serious, liberating work in
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.000]   your life, because Jesus said, "You will know the truth." When you read my Bible,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.360]   you'll know the truth, and the truth will set you free. Number three, expect new
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.840]   power in war with Satan, because that's the way Jesus defeated him in the
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.320]   wilderness. He quoted Scripture to the devil, and the devil could not stand
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.680]   before it. He won't stand before you either. He's a liar, he's a deceiver, he
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.000]   can't abide the truth. You're filling your head up with the truth, you're gonna
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.880]   be a valiant warrior more than you dreamed against Satan. Number four,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.600]   expect a deep, sanctifying work in your life, because John 17 17 says, "Sanctify
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:22.320]   them in the truth." Your Word is truth. Number five, expect to become a more
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.760]   loving person to those around you, because Paul in Philippians 1 9 says, he
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.960]   prays that our love may abound more and more with knowledge and all-deserving.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.880]   And he said in 1 Timothy 1 5 that the goal of his instruction, that is the goal
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:48.240]   of the Bible, is love from a pure heart. So unifying love for people growing in
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.960]   your heart as you immerse yourself in the whole sweep of Scripture. Number six,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.200]   expect that even though you are now saved in a decisive way, you're going to
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.240]   go on being saved by the Scriptures. Most people don't think about this. 1 Timothy
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:13.320]   4 16, pay close attention to yourself and your teaching the Scriptures,
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.600]   persevere in these, for as you do this, you will save both yourself and your
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.520]   hearers. The Bible is the means of God by which he goes on saving us. Number eight,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:38.360]   expect joy—great joy, unshakable joy that the world does not know, because Jesus
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.000]   said, "These things I have spoken to you." So you're reading them now, "These things I
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.540]   have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you and your joy may be full." So send the
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:56.640]   roots of your mind and your heart down into the whole Bible, and your joy will
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.000]   become indestructible. Number nine, expect to meet God. Meet God, not just truths
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.960]   about God. Expect to meet God, because it says in 1 Samuel 3 21, "The Lord appeared
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:22.760]   again at Shiloh, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel by the word of the
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:31.000]   Lord." He revealed himself by the word— himself by the word—and he does that. He
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.440]   does that. Expect to meet him. And finally, number 10, expect to see the glory of
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:47.200]   Christ. 2 Corinthians 3 18, we all—we believers—we all, with unveiled face,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.240]   beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.800]   from one degree of glory to the next. Now how do we know that happens in the Bible?
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:05.320]   Because if you follow the flow of Paul's thought from 3 18 into 4 4 and 4 6,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:12.880]   he refers to how we see the glory of Christ. Namely, we see it in the light of
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.080]   the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. And the gospel is the
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.880]   written narrative of the stories or the events and their meaning of the death
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.960]   and resurrection of Christ. So, Mike, I will pray for you what Paul prayed in
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   2 Thessalonians 1 11. He said this, "To this end, we pray for you, that our God
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:45.640]   may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every good resolve and every
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.600]   work of faith by his power." This is a great resolve before you. You've got a
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   great intention on your heart. Be valiant. Make a vow to the Lord to keep it, and
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.200]   you won't regret it. Amen. This will be a wonderful New Year's vow to the Lord.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the great question, Mike.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.360]   And here's a post-production note. Later, after we recorded this episode, I noticed
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.400]   that there was no number 7 in the list of 10 above, so I checked with Pastor
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.600]   John, and he didn't have a number 7 either. So instead of 10, it's actually
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.280]   9 total positives, if you're doing the math. And thanks for listening and
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.480]   subscribing to the podcast. Next up, one of the most 10 most asked about topics
