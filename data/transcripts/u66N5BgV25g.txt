[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   What the government is saying is that Apple is refusing to play ball with other applications, other operating systems, and that creates a monopolistic network effect.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.640]   What I think Apple would say is no, we've always done the hardware and the software together.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.520]   And that's what creates the magical experience.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:27.080]   And so Apple's entire product strategy is based on creating a vertically integrated stack that goes from hardware to operating system to key applications.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.800]   And I think Apple has a point saying, if you try to make us unwind all of that, the process is not going to work as well.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.120]   Make your choice with your dollars.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.320]   Make your vote with the product and service you want to buy instead of running to the government and asking the government to come and do stuff to make things happen.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760]   I want my government protecting me from crime and defending the country.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.560]   And I don't want all the other stuff that the government does to drive costs up, which is generally what the government does.
