[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.080]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.520]   Today, my guest is Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.020]   Dr. Galpin is a full and tenured professor
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.600]   in the Department of Kinesiology
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.160]   at California State University in Fullerton.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.920]   He is also a world expert
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.480]   in all things exercise science and kinesiology.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.580]   Today, you are going to hear
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.200]   what is essentially a masterclass in how to build fitness,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.960]   no matter what level of fitness you happen to have.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   He talks about how to build endurance
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.760]   and the multiple types of endurance.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.200]   He talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy,
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   which is the growth of muscle fibers.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.720]   So if you're seeking to get stronger
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.960]   or build bigger muscles or build endurance
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.160]   or all of those things, today, you're going to learn how.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.080]   You're also going to learn how to build flexibility,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.320]   how to hydrate properly for exercise.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.700]   And we'll also talk about nutrition and supplementation.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.280]   What makes Dr. Galpin so unique is his ability
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.120]   to span all levels of exercise science.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.120]   He has the ability to clearly communicate the sets
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.400]   and repetition schemes that one would want to follow,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.180]   for instance, to build more strength
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.760]   or to build larger muscles.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.960]   He also clearly describes exactly how to train
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.760]   if you want to build more endurance
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.320]   or enhance cardiovascular function.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.480]   What's highly unique about Dr. Galpin
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.080]   and the information he teaches
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.560]   and the way he communicates that information
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.760]   is that he can take specific recommendations
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.100]   of how recreational exercisers
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.200]   or even professional athletes ought to train
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.640]   for their specific goals and link that
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.860]   to specific mechanisms, that is the specific changes
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.600]   that need to occur in the nervous system
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   and in muscle fibers and indeed right down to the genetics
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.640]   of individual cells in your brain and body
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.760]   in order for those exercise adaptations to occur.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.040]   It's truly rare to find somebody that can span
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.200]   so many different levels of analysis
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.540]   and who is able to communicate all those levels
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.860]   of understanding in such a clear and actionable way.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.380]   Indeed, Dr. Galpin is one of just a handful of people
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.880]   to which I and many others look when they want to make sure
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.760]   that the information that they're getting about exercise
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   is gleaned from quality peer-reviewed studies,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.960]   hands-on experience with a wide variety
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.200]   of research subjects, meaning everyday people,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.800]   all the way up to professional athletes
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.260]   in a wide variety of sports.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.060]   So it's no surprise that he's not only
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.500]   one of the most knowledgeable,
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   but also the most trusted voices in exercise science.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.480]   Dr. Galpin is also an avid communicator
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.360]   of zero cost to consumer information about exercise science.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.720]   You can find him on Instagram @DrAndyGalpin
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.300]   and also on Twitter @DrAndyGalpin.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.700]   Both places he provides terrific information
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.080]   about recent studies, both from his laboratory
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.320]   and from other laboratories, more in-depth protocols
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.100]   of the sort that you'll hear about today.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.520]   So if you're not already following him,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.760]   be sure to do so.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.160]   He provides only the best information.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.760]   He's extremely nuanced and precise and clear
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   in delivering that information.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.960]   I'm certain that by the end of today's conversation,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.660]   you'll come away with a tremendous amount of new knowledge
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.100]   that you can devote to your exercise pursuits.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.740]   I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.760]   this May.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.280]   The first live event will be hosted
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.960]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.560]   The second live event will be hosted
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.960]   in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   Both are part of a lecture series entitled
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.560]   The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.600]   during which I will discuss science and science-based tools
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.240]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.660]   And I should point out that while some of the material
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.340]   I'll cover will overlap with information covered here
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.960]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.800]   and on various social media posts,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.960]   most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.840]   from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.360]   So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.720]   Portland on May 18th.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.840]   You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com/tour.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.120]   And I hope to see you there.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.640]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.580]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.800]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.200]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.280]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.020]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.240]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.760]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.200]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.520]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.240]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.680]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.960]   once or twice a day is that it helps me cover
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.720]   all of my basic nutritional needs.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.200]   It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   In addition, it has probiotics,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.820]   which are vital for microbiome health.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.680]   I've done a couple of episodes now
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.600]   on the so-called gut microbiome
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.360]   and the ways in which the microbiome interacts
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.440]   with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.600]   and essentially with every biological system
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.360]   relevant to health throughout your brain and body.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.140]   With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.160]   the minerals I need,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.920]   and the probiotics to support my microbiome.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.320]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.960]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.440]   and claim a special offer.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.200]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.940]   which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.060]   while you're on the road,
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.360]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.720]   There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.960]   is essential for various aspects of our brain
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.920]   and body health, even if we're getting a lot of sunshine.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.300]   Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.760]   and K2 is also important
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.920]   because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.260]   calcium in the body, and so on.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.060]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.560]   to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.060]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.040]   Thesis makes what are called nootropics,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.800]   which means smart drugs.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.120]   Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.740]   I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.660]   I don't believe that there's any one substance
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.800]   or collection of substances that can make us smarter.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.160]   I do believe based on science, however,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.680]   that there are particular neural circuits
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.240]   and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.960]   more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   That's just the way that the brain works.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.880]   Different neural circuits for different brain states.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.220]   And so the idea of a nootropic
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.040]   that's just going to make us smarter all around
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.280]   fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things, right?
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.340]   If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.560]   you're doing accounting, a different part of the day,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.400]   you need to be creative.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.560]   These are all different brain processes.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.080]   Thesis understands this.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.420]   And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.720]   to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.260]   They only use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.600]   which of course is essential.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.280]   Some of those I've talked about on the podcast,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.180]   things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.260]   They give you the ability to try several different blends
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.520]   over the course of a month,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.260]   discover which nootropics work best
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.560]   for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.480]   And with that personalization,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.380]   design a kit of nootropics that's ideal
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.840]   for the different brain and body states you want to access.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.160]   I've been using thesis for more than six months now,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.100]   and I can confidently say
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.760]   that the nootropics have been a total game changer.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.440]   My go-to formula is the clarity formula,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.580]   or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.620]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.560]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.540]   take a three minute quiz,
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.540]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.180]   to try in your first month.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.360]   That's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.000]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.120]   for 10% off your first order.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.080]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.740]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.360]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.920]   to help you better understand your body
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.820]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.600]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.920]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.000]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.520]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.140]   What's unique about Inside Tracker is that
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.400]   while there are a lot of different tests out there
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.080]   for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.920]   with Inside Tracker,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.220]   you get the numbers back in terms of your levels,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.240]   but they also give you very clear directives
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.920]   in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.560]   that can help you bring those values into the ranges
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.640]   that are best for you and your health goals.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.880]   And that's very different than a lot of the other programs
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   where you get a lot of information,
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.040]   but you don't really know what to do with that information.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.700]   Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to understand
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.600]   and very actionable based on the very easy to use
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.300]   dashboard at Inside Tracker.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.760]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.680]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   Welcome, Dr. Professor Andy Galpin.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.360]   It's been a long time coming.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.440]   We have friends in common,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.600]   but this is actually the first time
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.940]   we've sat down face to face.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.760]   - Yeah, I'm very excited.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.360]   - Yeah, there are only a handful,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   meaning about three or four people who I trust enough
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.720]   in the exercise physiology space that when they speak,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.280]   I not only listen, but I modify my protocols.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.420]   And you are among those three or four people.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.440]   So first of all, a debt of gratitude, thank you.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.240]   You've greatly shaped the protocols that I use.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.020]   And I know there's far more for me and for others to learn.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.780]   So you're a professor, you teach in university,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.560]   and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.720]   Muscle biopsy, literally, images down the microscope,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.380]   all the way to training professional athletes
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.800]   and everything in between.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.960]   So you are truly an N of one.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.680]   And just to start us off,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.080]   I would love to have you share with us
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.100]   what you think most everybody or even everybody should know
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.740]   about principles of strength training,
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.480]   principles of endurance training,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.760]   and principles of let's call it hypertrophy power
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.200]   and the other sort of categories of training.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.640]   And this could be very top contour,
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.960]   but what do you think everybody on planet earth
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.600]   should know about these categories
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.000]   of personal and athletic development?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.880]   - Well, that's a great first question.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.200]   Holy cow, I think I'll start it this way.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.840]   I tend to think about,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.480]   there's about nine different adaptations
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.160]   you can get from exercise.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.860]   Fat loss is not one of those.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.840]   It is a by-product,
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.480]   but that's not really what I'm getting at.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.600]   And so we can kind of categorize everything like that.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   And what we can talk about are what are the concepts
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   that you need to hit within each one,
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.500]   and then you can have infinite discussion
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.760]   of the different methodologies, right?
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.480]   And so that first thing to hit is
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.520]   the concepts are actually fairly few,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.800]   but the methods are many, right?
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.480]   People have said that in iterations throughout time.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.120]   So if you walk from the very beginning,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.960]   the first one to think about is what we'll just call skill.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.780]   So this is improving anything from say a golf swing
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.840]   to a squatting technique to running.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.020]   And this is just simply moving mechanically
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.000]   how you want your body to move.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.040]   I'm just gonna globally call that skill.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.780]   From there, we're gonna get into speed.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.240]   So this is moving as fast as possible.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.780]   The next one is power.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.800]   And power is a function of speed,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.840]   but it's also a function of the next one, which is strength.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.560]   So if you actually multiply strength by speed,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.120]   you get power.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.000]   And the reason I'm making this distinction, by the way,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.340]   is some of these are very close
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.680]   and I'm going in a specific order on purpose here.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.480]   For example, power is, like I just said,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.680]   it's a function of speed and strength.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.740]   So if you improve speed,
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.260]   you've also likely improved power, but not necessarily.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.580]   'Cause it could have come from the force direction either.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.520]   So there's carry over.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.800]   So like a lot of things that you would do
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.380]   for the development of strength and power,
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.080]   they are somewhat similar, but then there's differences.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.760]   So things that you would do correctly for power
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.680]   would really not develop much strength and vice versa.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.000]   So I'm gonna get into all these details later.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.240]   Once you get past strength,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.400]   and the next one kind of down the list is hypertrophy.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.580]   This is muscle size.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.560]   Growing muscle mass is one way to think about it.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.200]   After hypertrophy, you get into these categories
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.560]   of the next one is,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.060]   these are all globally endurance based issues.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.760]   And the very first one is called muscular endurance.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.860]   So this is your ability to do,
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.240]   how many pushups can you do in one minute?
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.860]   You know, things like that.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.400]   Past muscular endurance,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.300]   you're now into more of an energetic
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.200]   or even cardiovascular fatigue.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.740]   So you've left the local muscle
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.440]   and you're now into the entire physiological system
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.640]   and its ability to produce and sustain work.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.640]   And we can get into a bunch of differentiations
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.520]   with an endurance,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.200]   but just to keep it really simple right now,
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.160]   the very first one, think about this as,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   I call this anaerobic power, right?
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.320]   So this is your ability to produce a lot of work
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.600]   for say 30 seconds to maybe one minute,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.520]   kind of two minutes like that.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.540]   The next one down then is more closely aligned
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.560]   to what we'll call your VO2 max.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.740]   So this is your ability to kind of do the same thing,
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.520]   but more of a time domain of say three to 12 minutes.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.280]   So this is going to be a maximum heart rate,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.600]   but it's going to be well past just max heart rate.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.440]   Then after that,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.280]   we have what I call long duration endurance.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.540]   So this is your ability to sustain work.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.040]   The time domain doesn't matter
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.860]   in terms of how fast you're going.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.820]   It's how long can you sustain work?
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.780]   This is 30 plus minutes of no break like that.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.180]   So as just an high level overview,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.280]   those are the different things you can target.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.560]   And again, some of those crossover
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.320]   and some are actually a little bit
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.400]   contrarian to the other ones.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.840]   So pushing towards one
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.000]   is maybe going to sacrifice something else.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.680]   So as an overall start,
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.760]   that's really what we're looking at.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.920]   Within all of those though,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.280]   they do have similar concepts in terms of
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.960]   there's a handful of things you have got to do
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.560]   to make all of those things work.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.280]   And we could talk about as many of those as you want,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.220]   but one of them is functionally called progressive overload.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.080]   So whichever one you're trying to improve at,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.960]   if you want to continue to improve,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.460]   you have to have some method of overload.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.500]   And as you well know, you've talked about a lot,
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.340]   adaptation physiologically happens as a byproduct of stress.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.720]   So you have to push a system.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.900]   So if you continue to do, say,
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.400]   the exact same workout over time,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.280]   you better not expect much improvement.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   You can keep maintenance,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.940]   but you're not going to be adding additional stress.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.180]   So in general,
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.060]   you have to have some sort of progressive overload.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.080]   And we can talk in detail
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.160]   about what that means for each category.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.440]   But this could come from adding more weights.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.800]   This could come from adding more repetitions.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.700]   It could come from doing it more often in a week.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.020]   It could come from adding complexity to the movement.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.740]   So going from, say, a partial range of motion
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.420]   to a full range of motion or adding other variables.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.760]   So there's a lot of different ways to progress,
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.340]   but you have to have some sort of movement forward.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.680]   So if you have this kind of routine
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.600]   where you've built Monday, Wednesday,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.440]   and Saturday or something, and you just do that infinitely,
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.780]   you're not going to get very far.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.240]   So that's, I guess, the most high-level overview
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.600]   of all the things people can go after.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.400]   And then we can go from whatever direction
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.800]   you want from there.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.160]   - Well, I'd love to do the deep dive
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.480]   on each one of these for several hours.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.000]   But, and I imagine that over time, we probably will.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.080]   I'd love to chat about a couple of these
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   in a bit more depth.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.960]   So in terms of defining
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.840]   what the progressive overload variables are
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.160]   for these different categories,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.540]   maybe we could hit the two most common combinations
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.400]   of these nine things.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.440]   The first one being strength and hypertrophy.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.920]   And maybe we could lump power in there.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.320]   Maybe not, you're the exercise physiologist.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.360]   But strength and hypertrophy,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.500]   which at least bear some relationship.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.280]   And then maybe separately,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.840]   we could explore sustained work endurance,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.600]   this 30 minutes or longer continuously,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.700]   'cause I think many people train in that regime.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.700]   And probably something like VO2 max anaerobic as well,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.080]   because I know that a number of people now incorporate
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.260]   so-called HIIT or high intensity interval training.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.440]   I think with the hopes of either shortening their workouts
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.400]   and/or gaining some additional cardiovascular benefit.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.280]   So if we could start with strength and hypertrophy,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.480]   I know many people want to be stronger.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.000]   They want to grow larger muscles
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.800]   or at least maintain what they have.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.560]   So what are the progressive overload principles
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.800]   that are most effective over time
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.560]   for strength and hypertrophy?
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.720]   - Yeah, okay, so I'll actually go a little step back.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.560]   With every one of those categories I talked about,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.080]   you have what we call your modifiable variables.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.440]   So this is a very short list
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.940]   of all the things you can modify,
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.520]   the different variables within your workout
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.780]   that can be modified that will change the outcome.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.720]   Fancy way of saying, if you do this differently,
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.080]   then you're gonna get a different result.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.600]   So modifiable variables.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.560]   The very first one of those is called choice.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.000]   So this is the exercise choice that you select.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.560]   Now, one of, I'm gonna go double back here,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.080]   so I'm kind of doing a little bit of inception.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.520]   So follow me here as I'm going up a layer
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.920]   to come down a couple layers.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.840]   I have these fundamental laws of strength and conditioning
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.240]   that are kind of like a little bit of a joke,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.960]   but progressive overload is one of those laws.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.760]   Another one of those laws is your exercises themselves
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.840]   do not determine adaptations.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.780]   So here's what I mean.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.280]   If you're like, I want to get stronger,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.400]   you can't select an exercise.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.680]   That doesn't determine you getting strong.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.800]   If you don't do the exercise correctly,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.560]   and I'm not even referring to the technique,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.100]   that of course matters,
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.620]   but if you don't execute it in the right fashion,
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.100]   then you're not going to get that adaptation.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.560]   So if you choose, I want to get stronger,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.720]   I'm gonna do a bench press.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.580]   Well, if you do the wrong set range,
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.120]   the wrong repetition range, the wrong speed,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.960]   you won't get strength.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.940]   You maybe get muscular endurance
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.680]   and very little strength adaptation.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.540]   So the exercise selection itself is important,
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.280]   but it does not determine the outcome adaptation.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.080]   So the very first thing that you need to think about
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.560]   if you're like, I want to get stronger or add muscle
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.800]   is not the exercise choice, right?
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.440]   It is the application of the exercise.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.280]   What are the sets?
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.100]   What are the reps?
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.840]   What are the rest ranges that you're using?
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.240]   That's gonna be your primary determinant.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.280]   Now, some exercises are certainly better
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.120]   for some adaptations.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.680]   For example, a deadlift is probably not a great exercise
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.320]   to do for long duration endurance.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.220]   Like you could theoretically do 30 straight minutes
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.080]   of deadlifting, but it's probably not our best choice, right?
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.300]   It's probably a pretty good choice
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.480]   for strength development, right?
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.320]   'Cause you're gonna do a low repetition, high set range.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.720]   You could theoretically do bicep curls for power,
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.520]   but probably not your best choice, right?
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.960]   Single joint isolation movement
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   is not the best for developing power.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.780]   You've ever done a bicep curl as fast as you possibly can?
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.720]   Like that's not gonna go well.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.680]   So in theory, any exercise can produce any adaptation
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.360]   given the execution is performed properly.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.960]   So now that we've understood that a little bit,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.260]   the exercise itself does not determine the adaptation.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.000]   Coming within each one of these categories,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.840]   exercise choice is an important variable
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.220]   because it does lend you to things
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.240]   like what movement pattern you're in.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.120]   So in other words, if you wanna get stronger
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.720]   and you're thinking, okay, what exercise do I do?
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.180]   You need to think a little bit about
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.620]   what muscle groups do I wanna use?
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.700]   And that's gonna be leading you towards the exercise choice.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.420]   For example, I wanna use my quads more.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.660]   Okay, fine.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.800]   Maybe you're gonna choose more of a front squat
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.160]   type of variation, a goblet squat.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.360]   So the bar, the load is in front of you.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.400]   If you wanna emphasize maybe more of your hamstrings
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.880]   and glutes, you're gonna maybe put a barbell on your back
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.180]   or do a different one.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.980]   So the exercise choice is important to the prescription
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.660]   because it's gonna determine a lot of your success.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.460]   Okay, another kind of simpler way to think about this.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.540]   If you're a beginner or moderate to intermediate,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.580]   or maybe you don't have a coach,
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.800]   you probably wanna hedge towards an exercise selection
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.280]   that is a little bit easier technically.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.000]   So you maybe don't wanna do a barbell back squat.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.900]   It's actually a pretty complicated movement.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.660]   Maybe you wanna do a little bit more of, again,
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.700]   a goblet squat or even use some machines or a split squat,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.860]   something that's a little bit simpler
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.980]   because you don't have a coach,
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.980]   you're not a professional athlete.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.500]   The likelihood of success is higher
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.020]   and the risk has now gone lower.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.940]   So the very first variable within all of these
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.540]   is the exercise choice.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.980]   The second one is the intensity.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.140]   And that refers to, in this context, not perceived effort.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.980]   Like, wow, that was a really intense workout.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.500]   It is quite literally either a percentage
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.200]   of your one rep at max
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.640]   or a percentage of your maximum heart rate or VO2 max.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.820]   So for the strength-based things,
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.220]   you wanna think about what's the percentage
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.900]   of the maximum weight I could lift one time.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.540]   And that's what we're gonna call one rep max.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.180]   Or it's a percentage of my heart rate, right?
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.560]   So if I tell you to get on a bike
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.340]   and I want you to do intervals and I want you at 75%,
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.940]   I'm typically referring to 75% of your max heart rate
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.860]   or VO2 max or something like that.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.400]   If I tell you to do squats at 75%,
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.520]   that means 75% of the maximum amount of weight
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.440]   you could lift one time or close.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.800]   - In terms of determining one rep max,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.740]   I confess I've never actually taken the one rep max
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.180]   for any exercise,
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.340]   but I have some internal sense of what that might be
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.660]   or what range it might be.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.540]   Is it necessary for people to assess
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.700]   their one repetition maximum
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.880]   before going into these sorts of programs?
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.900]   - No, not at all.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.900]   I think a more intuitive way is to take a repetition range.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.300]   Well, you can do this a couple of different ways.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.100]   So there are equations you can run
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.820]   and you can just Google these anywhere.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.540]   And these are called conversion charts.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.220]   And so it says, okay, if I did 75 pounds on my bench press
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.820]   and I did it eight times,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.260]   you can just run an estimate to say,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.740]   okay, you're probably going to be able to bench
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.760]   about 95 pounds for one rep max or something.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.900]   So that's a very easy conversion chart.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.720]   So just pick a load that you feel comfortable with,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.900]   but it's kind of heavy, but not like crazy heavy.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.640]   And do as many repetitions as you can,
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.020]   what a really good technique.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.100]   And then look what that number would be.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.100]   So conversion charts. - Are we safer
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.680]   than doing one repetition maximum?
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.980]   - For the general public who has, again, no coaching,
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.820]   it's safer.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.800]   For a professional athlete, it's not any safer,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.860]   but, or not even a professional athlete,
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.700]   but a trained person with a coach.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.060]   But for most people, yeah, that's a good way to go about it.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.560]   You can also just kind of do it with feel in the sense that,
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.180]   say you want to do a set of five repetitions
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.260]   and you do the load and you think,
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.020]   I could have done one or two more.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.540]   And then you kind of have an idea
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.460]   of what that number is going to be.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.140]   If you think, man, that last one,
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.620]   I had to kind of really, really, really get after it,
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.100]   then maybe just call that number, right?
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.780]   So you don't have to get overly concerned.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.000]   In fact, when we start getting into these number ranges,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.060]   you're going to see that they're all ranges.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.500]   We're not going to give a specific 95%
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.140]   for one of these exact reasons.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.820]   It's not that precise for most of them.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.140]   In fact, some of them, like hypertrophy,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.740]   have enormous ranges that you almost can't miss.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.080]   So the intensity in that case doesn't even matter
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.320]   for the most part because that's not the primary determinant.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.720]   Some of these you're going to see intensity
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.100]   is the determinant and some of these you're going to see
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.180]   volume is the true determinant.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.740]   So intensity though is the second one.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.620]   Choice was the very first one, manipulable variable.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.500]   Intensity was the second one.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.060]   The third one is what we call volume.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.260]   And so this is just how many reps
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.620]   and how many sets are you doing, right?
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.880]   So if you're going to do three sets of 10,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.160]   that volume would be 30, right?
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.920]   Five sets of five, that volume is 25.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.740]   It's just a simple equation.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.940]   How much work are you totally doing?
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.140]   The next one past that is called rest intervals.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.580]   So this is the amount of time you're taking
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.160]   in between typically a set.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.820]   Then from there you have progression,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.940]   which is what we started to talk about,
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.940]   this progressive overload.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.340]   Are you increasing by weight or reps or rest intervals
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.140]   or complexity or whatever?
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.940]   So all of those things can be changed
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.980]   as a method of progression.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.580]   And so maybe you want to go progressing
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.380]   from a single joint exercise,
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.380]   like a leg extension on a machine,
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.680]   and you want to progress by moving
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.880]   to a whole body movement like a squat.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.720]   That in and of itself,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.660]   you don't have to change the load or the reps or the rest.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.120]   That is a representation of progressive overload.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.940]   And it's probably a pretty good place to start
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.780]   because number one, especially for beginners,
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.820]   you want to make sure that the movement pattern is correct.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.920]   Don't worry about intensity.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.060]   Don't worry about rep ranges or any of these things.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.220]   You need to learn to move correctly
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.060]   and you need to give your body some time
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.020]   to develop some tissue tolerance
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.740]   so that you're not getting overtly sore.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.320]   In general, soreness is a terrible proxy
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.660]   for exercise quality.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.580]   It's a really bad way to estimate
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.940]   whether it was a good or a bad workout,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.880]   especially for people in that beginner to middle,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.540]   to moderate, in fact, even the fat
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.100]   for our professional athletes.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.780]   We do not use soreness as a metric of a good workout.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.020]   It's a really bad idea for a bunch of reasons.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.980]   On the same token,
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.620]   because stress is required for adaptation,
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.780]   you don't want to leave at the gym
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.340]   and feel like, I don't really do much.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.180]   There has to be there.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.840]   So if you think about soreness on a scale of one to 10,
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.140]   you probably want to spend most of your time in the three.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.500]   - You mean post-exercise?
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.340]   - Yeah.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.240]   - In between workouts?
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.080]   - Totally.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.060]   - And I know we'll talk about recovery extensively later,
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.340]   but if one body part or set of body parts is sore,
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.940]   is that an indication that one should stay out of training?
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.780]   I would imagine the answer is no.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.420]   In most cases, and secondarily to that,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.780]   if a particular muscle is sore,
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.740]   does that mean that muscle is not ready to be trained again?
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.980]   - Yeah, the answer to both of those is the same,
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.780]   which is no, right?
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.880]   You can certainly train a sore muscle.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.620]   You need to, I guess,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.820]   have a little bit of feel on that, right?
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.980]   So if you're a sore of like,
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.620]   okay, and you're moving around a little bit,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.060]   and you're like, man, this is a little bit sore,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.020]   you can train.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.980]   If you're like, I can't sit on the couch without crying
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.380]   because my glutes are so sore,
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.420]   like we probably don't need to train again, right?
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.160]   - Does whimpering count as crying?
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.160]   - Yeah, in that particular case, I'd say,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.780]   you've actually gone to a place of detriment
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.620]   because now you're gonna have to skip a training session,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.680]   and now you're behind.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.380]   So your actual total volume, say across the month,
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.220]   is actually gonna be lower
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.780]   because you went way too hard in those workouts,
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.060]   had to take too many days off in between.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.700]   You're gonna see that you're gonna cover less distance
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.780]   over the course of a month or six months or even a year.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.560]   So you wanna walk a pretty fine line.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.980]   And for most people, I would say hedge a little bit
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   on the side of less sore than more sore
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.440]   because frequency is very, very important
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.300]   for almost all these adaptations.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.660]   - A training frequency.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.060]   - Which is the last modifiable variable, right?
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.300]   Frequency, which is how many times per week
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.940]   are you doing that thing?
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.760]   So those are kind of our global things
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   that we can play with.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.940]   So when I'm trying to manipulate
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.700]   and you can get strength versus hypertrophy,
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.420]   or you know what, I want like a little bit of both,
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.720]   all those variables are the things
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.560]   that are going through my mind.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.540]   Which one do I need to move in which direction
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.060]   so that I can get this outcome
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.540]   and not this outcome over here?
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.600]   For example, some folks might wanna get stronger,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.820]   but not put muscle mass on.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.600]   Some folks are just kind of want both.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.860]   And that's a lot of the general public.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.700]   I wanna get a little stronger
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.220]   and a little bit more muscle, great.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.820]   But there are instances where people for performance reasons
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.540]   or for purely personal preference,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.380]   like I don't wanna get any more muscle, great,
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.820]   but I wanna get stronger.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.900]   Awesome, if you manipulate those variables correctly,
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.340]   you can get exactly that.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.260]   Very little development of muscle size
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.860]   and a lot of development in strength.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.340]   And this is why we continue to break world records
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.020]   in sports like powerlifting and weightlifting
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.540]   that have weight classes.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.300]   So there's a top number that we can hit
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.580]   in terms of body size,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.000]   but yet we continue to get stronger and faster.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.820]   So this is very possible if you understand
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.340]   how to manipulate all those variables.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.940]   So that being said, we can start off with,
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.100]   you wanted to go strength and I think-
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.380]   - Yeah, strength and I love that you mentioned
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.480]   the fact that it is possible to increase strength
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.280]   without increasing muscle size, at least not dramatically,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.440]   because I think it's not just weight class athletes.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.120]   I know a lot of people who, for aesthetic reasons,
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.200]   they'd like to be stronger.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.720]   They're hearing that having strong bones
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.820]   and strong muscles and tendons,
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.860]   it's great for longevity and for avoiding injury
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.960]   and so many other features of life.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.460]   And yet they don't want to fill out progressively larger
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.100]   and larger sizes of clothing.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.620]   - And we can go harder to the mechanisms
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.460]   on that piece if you want,
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.920]   and we can save that and come back to it.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.980]   - Sure, what I'd love to, both,
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.140]   what I'd love to know, in other words,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.660]   if we could define some of these modifiable variables
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.740]   in the context of strength.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.960]   So let's say I were somebody who,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.040]   I come to you and I say,
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.160]   and let's just say for sake of balance here,
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.740]   'cause she actually does do some weight training,
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.820]   I bring my sister in and I say,
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.680]   me and my sister both want to get stronger.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.140]   What modifiable variables should,
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.980]   how should we modify the variables?
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.240]   - Love it, all right, great.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.340]   I'm going to do inception on you one more time.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.780]   So one of my other laws,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.980]   oh, this won't be fast, I promise,
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.740]   of strength and conditioning, is in general,
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.500]   the default is all joints through all range of motion.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.780]   So this is important because it's going to answer
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.740]   your very first question on this strength category.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.420]   So in general, the ankle should go
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.740]   through the full range of motion of the ankle.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.320]   The knee should go through the full range of motion,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.940]   the knee, the hip, the elbow, et cetera, et cetera, right?
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.420]   - Across the workout, not in a single movement.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.760]   - Well, right.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.140]   I would hope, unless there's an amazing exercise
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.980]   I haven't heard about.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.080]   - Well, there are some exercises
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.380]   that we're going to call more full body,
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.340]   think about a full snatch.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.320]   Like you're going to take a lot of your muscles,
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.240]   a lot of your joints through a lot of range of motions.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.540]   Other ones, like in isolation,
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.100]   we call these single joint exercises.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.060]   So imagine a bicep curl.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.520]   You have one joint in that particular case,
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.820]   the elbow moving, the shoulder and everything else
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.420]   is pretty much stable.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.380]   And this is how we'll differentiate multi-joint
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.580]   from single joint movements.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.180]   But yeah, so across, I would even say it doesn't even have
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.940]   to be the day, but maybe throughout the week.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.280]   Try to get every joint through full range of motion.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.800]   Now, a couple of quick caveats to that.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.660]   I am not advocating using full range of motion
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.560]   and allowing really bad exercise technique.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   So when I say full range of motion, that's the default.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.400]   That doesn't mean every single person can do that
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.520]   for every single exercise.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.320]   It means that's where we should be striving to
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.400]   and that's our starting point.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.700]   You're going to see a lot less injury
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.800]   and a lot more productivity out of your training sessions.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.600]   In fact, the science is fairly clear on this one.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.300]   Strength development, as well as hypertrophy,
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.320]   is generally enhanced with a larger range
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.920]   of motion of training.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   And the mechanisms are somewhat understood on that.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.840]   So that being said, if you have to get into, say,
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.880]   a bad position with your, say, low back,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.080]   the spine is a very good one.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.040]   In general, the spine should say it's very neutral,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.900]   is what we call it.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.480]   So no flexion, no extension, especially in the lumbar region.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.160]   So if you're doing, say, a deadlift,
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.940]   and in order to take your knee through a full range
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.840]   of motion on a deadlift,
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.160]   you have to compromise your back position.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.000]   That's no bueno.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.740]   So caveats there aside, don't kill me.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.240]   Like, in good positions always.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.040]   - And don't kill yourselves, more importantly.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.320]   - So why that matters is if we walk through strength,
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.660]   the very first thing I'm going to go through
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.040]   is the exercise selection.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.680]   So let's choose an exercise which ideally has
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.960]   a full range of motion or close to it.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.640]   That doesn't induce injury for you,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.420]   but you can still maintain good neck and low back
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.520]   and position and everything else.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.420]   You feel comfortable with, so you can feel strong,
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.680]   but you don't feel like, oh my gosh,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.880]   if you've never snatched before,
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.800]   having you do a snatch for a maximum, even 75%,
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.680]   like it's a terrible idea.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.760]   You're not going to feel confident
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.040]   it's going to be a train wreck.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.440]   I would rather put you on a machine bent press.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.040]   So you can go, I feel stable, I feel safe here,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.960]   and I can just express my strength.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.780]   So exercise choice in general, full range of motion,
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.760]   and you want to kind of balance between the movement areas.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.360]   So this is an upper body press.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.940]   So this is pushing away from you, bench press,
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.780]   things like that.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.680]   Upper body pull, pulling an implement towards you,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.240]   bent row, pull up.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.000]   The pressing should be horizontal,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.720]   so perpendicular to your body, as well as vertical.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.480]   So this is lifting a weight over top of your head,
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.520]   lifting away from you.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.600]   The pull version is pulling horizontally to you
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.020]   and pulling vertically down, pull up, things like that.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.540]   From the lower body, we typically call these hinges.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.920]   It's sort of a funny muscle thing
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.880]   that no one's going to laugh at,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.900]   but like maybe me and you here,
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.560]   is we'll categorize muscles as, or movements,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.080]   exercises as pushes and pulls, right?
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   So like a squat tends to be a push,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.520]   'cause you're pushing away the ground.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.440]   A deadlift is a pull,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.640]   'cause you're pulling the implement up to you.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.940]   But in reality, every single exercise is only ever a pull,
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.540]   'cause muscle doesn't push things away.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.480]   Muscle can only contract and pull on itself.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.120]   And so, again, super nerdy thing
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.400]   that like most people are like, "Yeah!"
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.680]   And everyone's like, "That's so dumb."
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.400]   - No, but I think it's a really important point,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   because it also speaks to something
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.540]   I think we'll get into later,
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.400]   which is that, you know, posterior chain,
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.240]   anterior chain. - Totally.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.840]   - And if that's mysterious to people,
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.800]   it'll become clear before long.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.320]   Posterior chain, anterior chain,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.460]   makes a lot of sense to me,
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.580]   because of the way it's grounded
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.960]   in the firing of motor neurons,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.180]   which is ultimately what controls muscle.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.420]   So it's also, I think- - Feel your nerves
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.440]   all the time. - Exactly.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.820]   So it also depends on the lens
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.280]   through which one looks at life and exercise.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.360]   Of course, my lens is primarily neuroscience.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.280]   So, but I realized that the importance,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.880]   I like this idea of pushing perpendicular to the body,
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   overhead, pulling both toward the body and from overhead.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.000]   That just makes really good intuitive sense,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.920]   especially since a lot of people
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.440]   were just listening to this and not watching it.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.720]   So in your minds, folks,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.560]   you can think about pushing away like a punch,
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.240]   or overhead, like lifting something overhead,
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.040]   and then pulling toward your midline,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.280]   or toward your body, rather,
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.480]   and then pulling yourself up,
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.600]   like a pull-up in PE class for those of you that-
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.160]   - So the lower body's the same thing, right?
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.640]   It's some sort of pushing away,
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.680]   like a squat, or a split squat, or a lunge,
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.840]   or something like that.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.000]   And then some sort of, again, we'll call pull or hinge.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.280]   So a deadlift, or a Romanian deadlift,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.320]   or a hamstring curl,
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.800]   or something where you're contracting
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.760]   and pulling the thing.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.600]   And you could split these
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.080]   into like a thousand different categories.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.780]   If you're really in that field,
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.040]   you're gonna wanna add a bunch of other ones.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.820]   But that's just like a rough conception.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.920]   So if you were going to do a single workout,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.840]   you could choose four exercises,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.880]   and you could choose one of each.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.040]   One press, upper body press, one upper body pull,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.460]   one lower body hinge, one lower body press.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.260]   And then that would be like a decently well-rounded exercise.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.920]   That's your exercise selection.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.480]   And if you're taking those through a full range of motion,
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.680]   you're at a pretty good spot, as close as you can.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.960]   The next one is intensity.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.440]   So if you wanna develop strength,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.360]   this comes back to one of my favorite scientists of all time,
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   who happens to be a nerve guy, actually.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.820]   And generally, I like to shit on nerves
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.320]   as much as I possibly can, 'cause I'm a muscle guy.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.500]   But I have to give Henneman some credit here, right?
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.680]   And I know you know who that is.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.620]   Henneman's size principle.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.240]   Yeah, of course, right?
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.500]   So this is a series of papers.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.840]   I think it was in "Nature."
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.060]   At least some of them, yeah.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.360]   Yeah, in 1954, '56, or like something.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.220]   You can fact check me, I'm sure you will.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.680]   But he basically outlined this idea that,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.800]   okay, there's a certain recruitment threshold needed
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   for neurons to fire.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.820]   And we have muscle fibers in what we call
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.160]   fast twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch muscle fibers.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.220]   And in general, you're going to activate
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.760]   the slow twitch ones first,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.000]   because they tend to be associated
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.760]   with low threshold motor neurons.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.640]   It's not exactly that way, but it's close enough, right?
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.240]   Well, the only way that you activate
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.760]   some of these higher threshold neurons
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.880]   is to demand the muscle to produce more force.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.800]   And it's fairly specific to force, right?
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.200]   It's not something you can do over an endurance thing,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   unless it gets really extreme and particularly happens.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.280]   So in general, the only way to use
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.720]   these big chunks of your muscle,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.520]   which are incredibly important for aging, by the way,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.400]   one of the major problems we have with aging developing
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.040]   or development of aging related issues with muscle
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.560]   is the fact that we lose fast twitch fibers preferentially.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.200]   And then we have major problems as we go down the line
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.280]   because we've lost a big chunk of our strength and size.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.040]   So you want to make sure these fibers stay alive and intact.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.520]   Okay, so if that being said,
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.360]   the only way to develop strength
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.440]   is then to challenge the muscle to produce more total force.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.160]   If you are fairly untrained or new,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.280]   I guess I should have stated this all
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.120]   at the beginning as well.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.520]   One more inception, then I'll stop.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.040]   When it comes to this level of detail
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.600]   of exercise prescription, a fairly untrained person
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   is going to respond basically the same
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.240]   to every single thing you do.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.840]   In fact, we've done this in the lab many times.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.280]   We've done training studies
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.720]   doing things like 30 minutes of cycling
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.400]   and seeing huge increases in muscle strength and size,
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.880]   which is not a prescription for most people to increase size,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.920]   but people that are really untrained,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.240]   if you did plyometrics or strength training
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.160]   or endurance running,
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.560]   they all just get better at everything.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.880]   So that caveat kind of aside,
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.200]   if you want to be more intentional
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.240]   and more specific to the goal of strength,
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.760]   you need to produce more force.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.800]   Specificity matters, right?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.400]   So we have size principle to help understand this,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.200]   and we have our laws of specificity,
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.480]   which say said principle, right?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.760]   Specific adaptation to imposed demand.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.960]   So the adaptation you get or the result of your training
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.600]   is going to be a reflection of the demand that you imposed.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.240]   So if you want to get stronger,
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.800]   you need to impose a demand of strength, not repetitions.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.520]   So this has to be, the load has to be very high.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.800]   In general, you're probably looking
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.760]   at above 85% of your winner at max.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.240]   If you're moderately trained, maybe 75% will work.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.400]   Lowly trained again, everything works.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.080]   But in general, we want to be pressing a load
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.920]   that's very high.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.480]   So because the intensity demand is so high,
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.080]   that is going to force you to do a low repetition range.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   You can't do 12 reps at 95%.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.900]   Then it wouldn't be 95% of your winner at max.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.740]   So by definition, true strength training
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.360]   is really going to be in like five repetitions per set
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.000]   or less range.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.960]   That's where most of it's going to occur for specificity.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   So we've covered choice, intensity, and repetitions, right?
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.400]   The total amount of sets that you do
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.540]   is really kind of up to your personal fitness level, right?
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.400]   If you did as little as like three sets per exercise,
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.380]   that's probably enough.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.280]   - Work sets.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.000]   - Totally, yeah, totally work sets, right.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.560]   So get fully warmed up and build up to that 85%.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.380]   Don't just walk into the gym and throw 85% on and go,
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.960]   "Thank you, that's an important distinction."
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.520]   So work your way up, do some, like a very classic warmup
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.040]   thing would be like a set of 10 at 50%,
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.400]   a set of eight at 60%, a set of maybe eight again at 70%,
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.320]   and then maybe like a set of five at 75%.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.020]   So two or three or four sets kind of building intensity
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.720]   and lowering the rep range.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.160]   And then you would go after your two or three working sets.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.720]   Also, in terms of rest intervals.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.240]   Now, because we're trying to,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.520]   the primary driver of strength is intensity.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.200]   It's not the volume, right, it's the intensity.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.140]   So in order to maintain that,
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.440]   we have to do a low repetition range.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.120]   But in addition, we also have to have a high rest interval
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.340]   because if we start to,
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.280]   if we have any amount of fatigue can occur
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.420]   and we have to then either reduce the reps
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.620]   or reduce the intensity, we've lost the primary driver.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.200]   We've lost that main signal.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.660]   So the number we're gonna throw out typically
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.300]   is like two to four minutes.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.480]   So imagine you did, you know, your set of bench press
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.240]   and you did five repetitions at 85%,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.280]   you probably want to rest two to four minutes
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.180]   before coming back to the bench.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.240]   That doesn't mean you have to sit there on your phone.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.880]   Like, in fact, please don't.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.080]   Like, everyone will thank you for not doing that,
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.900]   I promise.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.400]   You can engage other muscle groups.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.800]   This is what we call supersetting.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.040]   So you're doing your bench press
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.600]   and while that two minute clock
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.120]   is running for your chest to rest,
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.280]   you can go over and do your deadlifts.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.160]   And so, you know, you can kind of move back and forth
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.640]   and this is how you can make strength training
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.820]   not seven hour workout.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.660]   If you're a professional athlete,
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.220]   you're gonna take that time
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.320]   because you want to maximize the outcome.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.520]   We've done this actually in our lab too.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.840]   Supersets will reduce the strength gains
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.180]   but by a tiny amount and most of us don't care enough
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.040]   relative to it's going to triple the length
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.720]   of your training session.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.640]   It's not worth it.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.560]   So for the average person, I will tell them,
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.400]   yeah, superset.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.920]   For someone who's trying to break a world record
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.040]   in weightlifting or powerlifting, I don't superset.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.880]   - Interesting.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.280]   You know, I think I've found that
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.920]   I don't recover particularly well
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.640]   from strength and hypertrophy training.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.160]   - Like in the workout or the next day?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.360]   - From workout to workout.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.200]   Unless I keep the total duration of those workouts,
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.680]   I like to say no more than 60 minutes of work,
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.280]   of real work, maybe 75.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.880]   Past 75, I find that I just start to,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.380]   I have to introduce additional rest days
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.840]   or I just get weaker over time.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.240]   So I'd set a kind of a limit at 50 minutes
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.200]   and then I usually violate that limit
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.220]   and end up doing 60 minutes.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.220]   So I'm excited to hear that one can superset exercises
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.600]   as long as they work different muscle groups, of course.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.280]   So I wouldn't want to do like bench press
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.760]   and overhead press supersetted 'cause we can,
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.900]   I think that goes without saying for most people
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.240]   but just to point that out.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.060]   But that I could do some push-pull, push-pull
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.760]   without compromising total intensity that much.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.400]   And I certainly would be willing to give up
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.220]   a rep here or there or a few pounds here or there.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.400]   And may I ask whether or not in doing that
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   one gets any even tiny bit or more of additional benefit
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.480]   in terms of cardiovascular work?
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.520]   Because I imagine after all, even a one rep max,
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520]   which I've never done as I mentioned,
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.340]   but let's say I get three reps on the overhead press
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.640]   and then I get four reps on a weighted pull-up
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.840]   and I'm going back and forth.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.880]   I'm no doubt going to be breathing harder
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.520]   than if I was sitting there texting away on my phone
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.540]   in between sets.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.660]   - Yep, of course.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.360]   Yeah, and so in fact, in general,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.140]   one of the things that I'll present in my class
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.900]   is a giant list of, in fact, on the top
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.640]   is all of these different exercise adaptations
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.240]   I started the conversation with.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.840]   And on the vertical column are as many
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.800]   of the physiological potential adaptations one would get.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.320]   So changes in endogenous pH, blood pressure,
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.200]   lymphatic changes, bone density, all these things, right?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.360]   And just have this giant list.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.200]   And then you can run a matrix and you can start to look at,
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.400]   okay, if I do speed training,
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.840]   am I going to see changes in the nervous system?
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.320]   Well, like very much so, right?
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.140]   That's the primary actual reason those things work.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.720]   Very little change in the muscle system.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.260]   It's almost exclusively explained by the central
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.000]   or peripheral nervous system, right?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.400]   On that same token, are you going to expect
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.480]   many cardiovascular adaptations from speed?
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.140]   And the answer is no, because although we didn't cover it,
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.960]   speed is very low intensity, very low rep range,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.640]   very high rest.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.920]   Well, as you go to like strength
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.880]   and then you go to hypertrophy,
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.800]   you start seeing more and more increases
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.020]   in cardiovascular adaptations
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.000]   because you're doing exactly that, right?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.040]   You're starting to reduce stress
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.360]   and you're starting to increase volume.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.700]   But you're going to lose things
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.340]   like bone mineral adaptations
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.160]   because the load starts to go down.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.540]   So you can look at this matrix and kind of understand
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.560]   if I'm a person who wants to kind of maximize
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.300]   the adaptations I get across my entire physiology
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.680]   for the least amount of work,
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.900]   you can choose these different adaptations to go after
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.660]   that are going to kind of land on these things, right?
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.940]   And exactly as you mentioned,
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.820]   if you're going to take five minutes rest between each rep,
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.740]   so let's say the extreme,
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.240]   you're going to do three sets of one repetition for strength
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.800]   at 95%, you're going to take probably five,
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.660]   maybe seven minutes between each attempt.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.560]   Like you better not expect many like changes
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.720]   in your resting blood pressure,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.840]   that there's no cardiovascular strain there.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.620]   You're going to put it together in a circuit
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:48.460]   where you're going to lose
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.880]   some potential strength adaptation,
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.360]   but you're going to gain something there.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.480]   So all of these things are,
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.760]   it's not about good or bad or right or wrong.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.240]   It's always about what advantage do you want
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.200]   and what disadvantage do you want?
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.600]   And I can cut like really into the chase here
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.560]   on one of these things,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.360]   'cause we'll get to this eventually.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.320]   If you want to know the ones
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   that are going to generally give you
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.000]   the most physiological adaptations across the most categories
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.940]   you're almost always looking
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.640]   for hypertrophy type of training.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.300]   And then there's this anaerobic conditioning
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.140]   piece that we'll get into.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.080]   That's going to hit the most systems at once.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:20.960]   - That's great to know.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.060]   And we should definitely go a little bit deeper
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.960]   on those types of what the modifiable variables are
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.860]   for those categories.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.860]   'Cause I think that I'm guessing the vast majority
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.680]   of people want to be a bit stronger,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.280]   maybe add some, a little bit of muscle or more,
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.080]   make sure their heart is healthy and et cetera.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.600]   This is wonderful.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.440]   And I think it's clarifying certainly a lot for me.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.280]   So for strength, let's, I guess training frequency.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.120]   - Frequency, cool.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.420]   - So what should determine training frequency?
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:54.080]   And I had the great benefit of a long time ago
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.800]   when I was in high school, actually,
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.560]   I paid for a session over the phone with Mike Mentzer.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.400]   - Oh, lovely.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.600]   - You know, the Mike Mentzer.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.200]   We got to be friends over time.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.360]   At the time I was pretty young and my mother kept saying
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.320]   like, why is this like grown man calling the house?
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.060]   And we would talk all the time about training,
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.480]   but he tried to convince me to train once every five
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.440]   to seven days, very few sets, very high intensity.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:23.240]   And I must say it worked incredibly well.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.080]   - Sure.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.960]   - It was, I think with my recovery quotient,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.400]   which was not very good, I think has improved over time,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.240]   but was not very good.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.940]   It was remarkable.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.400]   But of course, this was a time when I was, you know.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.240]   - Full of the most animalism you've ever had.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.080]   - I was 14, I was on my own version of anabolics, right?
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.860]   It was, you know, really had, I had a long arc of puberty.
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.220]   - And you were untrained.
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.300]   - And I was mostly untrained.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.580]   I've been running cross country and skateboarding
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.700]   and playing soccer, so.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.020]   - And doing all the things that are like the antithesis
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.860]   of growing muscle.
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.620]   - It was literally, and people will probably say impossible,
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.460]   it was something like 40 pounds of muscle
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.540]   inside of 12 months.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.380]   It was crazy.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.200]   - I would believe that.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.740]   - You know, but, and so then of course
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.380]   that stopped working over time.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.300]   And then you start going down the odyssey
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.220]   of trying to find the thing that's going to work that well.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.600]   And you eventually realized that it was
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.060]   because you were untrained, right?
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.820]   So training frequency is crucial.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.380]   Let's say that people are doing these whole body workouts
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.220]   as you've described them.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.060]   Not alternating upper body, lower body.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.200]   'Cause there's so many different splits
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.640]   that we probably doesn't make sense
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.920]   to go into splits right now.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.400]   But how often can and should one train a muscle?
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.640]   And how do you know if a muscle is recovered locally?
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.360]   And how do you know if your nervous system
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.580]   is recovered systemically?
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.660]   - Okay, this is a bunch of really interesting questions.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.240]   I'm not sure exactly what route you want to go.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.940]   So I'll start here.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.380]   As I mentioned earlier,
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.820]   soreness is not a good barometer of exercise quality
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.340]   because some types of training
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.720]   are going to induce more soreness
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.000]   and some are going to induce less.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.400]   That's important to this conversation
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.580]   because when you ask about how do you know
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.680]   if a muscle is ready to train again,
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.120]   one of the question is, what are you training for?
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.560]   If you're training for hypertrophy,
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.480]   muscle size, muscle growth,
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.200]   we need to hedge towards recovery
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.180]   because what you're trying to do
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.820]   is cause a massive insult there,
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.340]   allow then protein synthesis to occur,
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.600]   building of new tissue, which takes time,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.220]   48 to 72 hours, like kind of at a minimum,
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.520]   that process needs to occur.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.420]   If you're doing actually more strength,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.560]   and this is a differentiation
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.300]   between hypertrophy and strength,
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.280]   then you didn't induce actually much damage.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.100]   In fact, you're generally not going to get very sore
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.260]   from true strength training, very little,
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.560]   unless you get really heavy or you did it a lot.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.860]   The primary driver of hypertrophy
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.440]   is not the same primary driver of strength.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.360]   We talked about that already.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.940]   That's intensity driven.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:43.020]   For hypertrophy, it's not intensity.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.100]   So because we have different mechanisms,
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.420]   we have different outcomes,
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.460]   even though they're closely aligned,
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.280]   strength is not going to cause a lot of soreness.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.380]   Therefore, intensity is the driver.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.740]   Therefore, frequency can be as high as you want.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.820]   So you can train every single day, the same exact muscle,
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.340]   if speed or power or strength
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.340]   are the primary training tools,
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.380]   because you need stimulus there, skill as well, right?
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.660]   Practice.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.060]   You know that as much as anybody.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.500]   Developing a new motor pattern
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.660]   requires a lot of repetitions, right?
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.460]   You don't need a tremendous amount of rest.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.860]   That's not, it's not a damage thing, right?
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.540]   It's a re-patterning issue.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   So strength training, in fact, if you look at,
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.860]   again, true strength professional athletes,
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.860]   they're going to train the same muscles basically every day.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.680]   - Wow.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.520]   - They're going to squat every day.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.540]   - And is that because the primary mode of adaptation
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.260]   is recruitment of these high threshold motor units?
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.020]   So it's mainly neural.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.160]   - No.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.300]   So everyone's going to say that,
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.620]   and this is where I get all feisty.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.720]   - Well, I'm not saying that.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.340]   That was actually, there was a question mark there.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.180]   - Okay, okay.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.860]   - If we were online putting comments,
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.980]   there'd be a question mark.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.340]   - We would have fought.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.860]   I would have blocked you.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.680]   I was just kidding.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.860]   - I think you already blocked me.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.700]   - Probably twice.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.380]   (laughing)
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.840]   Okay.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.780]   The early adaptations to exercise,
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.620]   especially strength training,
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.840]   are hedged towards the nervous system.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.680]   No question about it.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.860]   People always say central nervous system,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.100]   but it's probably more peripheral, right?
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.200]   Whatever, semantics probably, but pedantic.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.960]   It's nerve.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.880]   If you train today, tomorrow morning,
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.660]   you're not going to wake up with a actually increase
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.440]   in contractile proteins in muscle.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.220]   Your muscle might be a little bit bigger
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.020]   due to some acute swelling,
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:25.900]   but you could have a pretty acute that persists change
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.260]   in the nervous system, we'll call it,
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.580]   that allows you to be stronger within a couple of days.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.980]   Sustained hypertrophy is probably more along the lines
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.300]   of four weeks where we can see that, right?
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.100]   We can actually see changes like in the ultrasound.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.500]   Now, you're making changes immediately.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.260]   That protein synthesis process is happening very fast,
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.140]   and it's going to last.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.420]   It just takes us time to measure it
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.380]   in terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle size.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.220]   So that being said, the first four weeks,
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.900]   we typically say are primarily nervous system.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.700]   After that, now we're starting to see most of the changes
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.000]   coming from the muscle side of the equation.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.900]   So with strength development,
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.560]   it's a combination of three areas.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.940]   In fact, all muscle contraction has these same three things.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.260]   It starts off with some signal, right?
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.580]   From somewhere in the body,
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.740]   whether it's all the way up the top
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.060]   or at the level of the spine,
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.560]   depending on if this is a reaction
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.660]   or an actual conscious control.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.100]   From there, that some signal has to tell the muscle
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.020]   to contract, okay?
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.220]   So signal is one.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.780]   Two, it's muscular contraction.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.840]   And there's a lot of variables
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.980]   inside the muscle tissue itself
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.900]   that determine its functionality.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.740]   And so if we took an individual biopsy
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.580]   and took a muscle fiber from you and took one from me,
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.460]   and we took those muscles out and put them in a Petri dish,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.780]   and I tied one end to a force transducer
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.940]   and the other end to a thing that pulls it,
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.580]   and we soaked it in a bath of calcium
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.940]   and a bunch of other stuff,
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.480]   even if they were the same size,
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.540]   your fibers might contract a lot faster than mine,
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.560]   even relative to size, or not, or slower,
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.120]   or there's various properties.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.960]   So the intrinsic fibers themselves
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.200]   determine a lot of functionality.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.060]   From there, muscle fibers don't cause movements.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.960]   Muscle fibers simply contract.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.680]   They're all surrounded with connective tissue.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.520]   And that's all surrounded
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.140]   with a bunch of more connective tissue.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.460]   That all surrounds into a muscle.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.680]   That muscle is then surrounded with more connective tissue.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.600]   That all comes together into a giant tendon.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.120]   That tendon attaches to the bone.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.460]   It's pulling on those tendon
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.840]   that actually move the bone that cause human movement.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.740]   So that's area three.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.100]   Area one, the nervous system.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.500]   Area two, the muscle contraction.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.820]   Area three, some sort of connective tissue thing.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:28.460]   Changes happen at all three of those levels.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.740]   And we're not even now talking,
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.700]   we even entered the discussion of biomechanics,
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.580]   and you changed, say, the panation angle of the muscle,
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.620]   which is the angle at which the muscle fibers
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.720]   lay relative to the bone, right?
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.820]   So this is basic mechanics.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.660]   Is it pulling perpendicular to the bone?
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.580]   Is it pulling horizontal to the bone or some sort of angle?
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.960]   All of these things determine human performance.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.040]   So when you're talking about, again,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.760]   that strength development,
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.900]   you can see tremendous improvements
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.280]   in total force production
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.060]   by manipulating all of those areas,
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.120]   and you have not touched changes in muscle size.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.640]   If you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion,
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.420]   whether this is circle plasmic or contractile proteins,
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.260]   you have given yourself more opportunity
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.120]   to produce more force.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.060]   It doesn't guarantee you produce more force.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.460]   Bodybuilders are not stronger than power lifters,
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.100]   even though they have more muscle.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.180]   But bodybuilders are probably stronger than most people.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.660]   So there is a relationship between muscle size and strength.
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.280]   It's just not a one-to-one guaranteed ratio,
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.780]   and that's generally because
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.040]   although the muscle has been aided,
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.460]   they may have not changed the biomechanical considerations,
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.740]   they may have not changed the connective tissue,
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.860]   nor the nervous system stuff.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.220]   And so that's why we see this giant relationship
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.080]   that R-value is pretty high
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.160]   between strength and hypertrophy,
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.240]   but if you really wanna get to the ends of it, it's not.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.500]   And that matters to your actual question 10 minutes ago,
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.660]   because again, you can train strength daily
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.000]   on the same muscle,
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.020]   but if you want to allow for that process
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:00.640]   of contractile proteins to add and grow,
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.240]   then you're gonna have to allow some recovery,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.820]   because if you go back into that muscle too soon,
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.540]   you're gonna blunt the response,
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.360]   you're gonna stop it, you're gonna cut it off.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.840]   You have all kinds of problems going on in the cell
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.340]   that are gonna just attenuate that growth response.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.380]   So I gave you the answer for strength training.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.100]   The answer for hypertrophy is
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:23.260]   probably less than three out of 10 on level of soreness,
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.100]   so you can go again.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.540]   In general, you're probably looking at 72 hours
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.260]   is the optimal window.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.820]   So if you trained your shoulders on Monday,
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.020]   you probably would don't wanna train them again on Tuesday.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.900]   If hypertrophy is the goal,
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.660]   maybe Wednesday, maybe Thursday is best.
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.160]   So something like an every two to three day window
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.600]   is probably,
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.820]   and we know a little bit more now about why that is.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.460]   The gene cascade, the signaling response happens,
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.760]   well, the signaling happens instantaneously, right?
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.980]   Within seconds.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.160]   The gene cascade is probably in the,
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.680]   peaked in the four hour window,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.960]   like depending on which gene you wanna look at,
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.760]   but it's just kind of a snapshot.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.820]   But the protein synthesis process is 24 to 48 hour thing,
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.300]   and so it tends to kind of look like let that thing finish
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.780]   and let that signal go back to baseline
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.420]   and then hit it again.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.420]   And then hit it again.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.180]   And now as long as you're providing the nutrients,
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.060]   the recovery should happen,
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.420]   and you should be able to sustain the same work output
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.180]   in the training session so the stimulus stays high
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.060]   and the recovery's there
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.060]   and you can now continue to grow muscle.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:29.320]   - You mentioned 48 to 72 hours for hypertrophy.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:35.260]   What if, for whatever reasons,
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.180]   the training split, lifestyle factors, et cetera,
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.880]   somebody say, let's use your example,
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.840]   trains shoulders on Monday,
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.580]   ideally they would train them again on Thursday
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.780]   in their particular instance,
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.980]   somewhere Wednesday or Thursday, but they don't.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:55.260]   They wait until Saturday or Sunday for whatever reason.
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.260]   Maybe it's more compatible with their work,
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.940]   work and other exercise schedule, whatever the reason.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.160]   Are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gained
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.460]   or they've missed a window to induce further hypertrophy?
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.020]   - It's probably better to think about it the latter.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.340]   It's not that you've lost,
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.140]   it's just you've just kind of lost an opportunity
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.800]   to make more progress.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.020]   I will save you a little bit,
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.140]   and kind of going back to your HIIT program,
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.360]   this is the original high-intensity training,
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.520]   the menstrual thing, right?
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.820]   Which is not-
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.680]   - The HIIT with one eye,
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.380]   not the high-intensity interval training,
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.520]   but high-intensity training,
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.820]   like one set to absolute failure,
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.200]   maybe two for each muscle group.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.240]   - 20-minute workouts.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.500]   - Dividing your body into a three-way split,
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.440]   and then literally training six times a month,
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.300]   which most people would think that is absolutely crazy.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.560]   There's no way that's going to work.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.440]   And I can tell you, if you are untrained,
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.560]   you grow like a weed, if you train hard enough.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.040]   - Even if you're trained, look at the people Mike trained.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.920]   He put a lot of bodybuilders on really high levels.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.180]   Now they had the same similar help you had
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.020]   at that timeframe.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.840]   - Wait, to be very clear, I was not taking
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.880]   exogenous antibiotics.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.700]   In fact, I will-
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.920]   - No, but your exogenous was just as good.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.760]   - I probably was.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.680]   I wasn't measuring my levels there, but I probably would.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.580]   I grew easy.
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.880]   And in general, I tend to grow pretty easily
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.920]   from weight training.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.280]   And I should say that, to Mike's credit,
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.940]   and I think this is an important message,
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.360]   that he was the one who really said,
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.160]   look, unless you're going to make
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.360]   a professional career out of it,
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.080]   do not run the health hazards of exogenous hormones.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.280]   Certainly not at your age.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.080]   So he deterred me from that, which was great,
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.440]   because it never entered my mind.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.540]   It just was one of those things where Mike Mentzer
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.540]   said, don't do it.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.180]   And he had clearly done it, right?
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.100]   And so he's speaking from an informed place.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.100]   It never entered my mind, but also I was,
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.220]   what was really wild is I was continuing
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.960]   to run across country.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.280]   And so there was a trade-off there at some point.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.080]   But when you're young, you can get,
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.220]   many people can get away with what at this age
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.500]   would surely place me into a state of over-training,
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.420]   even at low volume.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.260]   We'll see.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.340]   - Yeah, well, I mean, like the whole field
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.920]   on interference effects has changed quite a bit recently,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.580]   which we can come back to if you want.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.140]   But just to finish out the idea here
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.300]   with that last question,
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:13.280]   if you want to take five days or six days
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.580]   in between each muscle group, you can do that.
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:16.640]   In fact, if you look at the research,
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.200]   it's going to show that frequency is not that important.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.140]   It will, it's not that it's unimportant,
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:25.860]   but it can handle changes as long as you get
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.700]   the same total volume.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.440]   So you can do that.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.140]   You just have to do a lot more work in that one workout.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.620]   If you care about the six week, eight week thing,
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.120]   if you're like, I'm in this for the next 60 years,
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.780]   like it's probably okay, right?
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.620]   But it can be there.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.300]   The challenge with splitting up your training sessions
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:48.340]   for hypertrophy into smaller numbers,
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.380]   like once or twice a week,
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.620]   it's just difficult to get that number.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.180]   It's typical to get that volume done.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.600]   Volume wise, the more recent meta-analyses are going to say
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.340]   that you're probably looking at around 10 working sets
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.080]   per muscle group per week.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.820]   Seems to be kind of the minimum threshold
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.920]   that you're going to want to hit.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.300]   So if you did three sets of 10 at your shoulders on Monday,
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.140]   three sets of 10 shoulders Wednesday and three on Friday,
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.820]   that's nine working sets.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:20.740]   If you wanted to do three different shoulder exercises
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.320]   on Monday and hit your nine sets,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.500]   it's not really actually going to be that much different.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.700]   The problem is 10 is kind of a minimum.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.340]   You probably want to look for more like 15 to 20.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.020]   And in fact, well-trained folks, 20, 25.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.960]   That becomes very challenging in one workout.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.140]   In fact, defunct though,
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.280]   you're not going to be able to do it, right?
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.260]   And so that is where it's not the frequency
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.100]   that looks like it kills you.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.600]   It's just the fact you have got to get,
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.860]   because the total driver of strength is intensity,
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.620]   but the total driver of hypertrophy is volume.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.360]   Assume you're taking it to fatigue, right?
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.460]   Or muscular failure.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.240]   So it's just tough to get enough done if you can.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.020]   And if you want to set your schedule up that way,
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.600]   like you probably remember,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.160]   if you do those types of training sessions
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.860]   where you're just going to completely exhaust a muscle,
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.520]   it's going to be sore for a while.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.440]   You're probably not going to come back.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.280]   And that's sort of the logic behind that was
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.380]   let's take this thing to tremendous failure
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.280]   and give it six days to recover.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.460]   It can work. It's just not the best.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.220]   I think is one way to think about it for most people.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.520]   - It's also hard to do those workouts
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.620]   without a training partner,
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:24.000]   if you really want to do them correctly.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.480]   - And stimulants and headphones
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.160]   and all kinds of other things, right?
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   - Well, anyway, yeah, stimulants are not,
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.760]   certainly don't recommend those.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.560]   It may be a cup of coffee or two, if that's your thing,
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.860]   and maybe some of the safer supplements,
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.000]   but certainly not the sorts of stimulants
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.480]   that the guys in the seventies and eighties
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.660]   were famous for. - Or still use.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.500]   - Or still use.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.820]   You talked about repetition ranges broadly
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.300]   for strength training, so five or less.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.100]   You said frequency could be as often as every day,
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.740]   rest two to four minutes, maybe even longer
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.900]   if you're going for one repetition maximum.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.900]   For hypertrophy, what are the repetition ranges
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.820]   that are effective and what are the ones
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:06.280]   that are most effective if one is trying to maximize
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.580]   some of the other variables?
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.320]   Like people don't want to spend more than an hour
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.920]   to 75 minutes in the gym.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.860]   Because I think that while the rep ranges
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.300]   might be quite broad, as you alluded to earlier,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.640]   there's the practical, there are the practical constraints.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.180]   So what repetition ranges or percent
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.820]   of one repetition maximum should people consider
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.980]   when thinking about hypertrophy?
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.940]   - Right, the quick answer there is anywhere
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.860]   between like five to 30 reps per set.
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.700]   That's going to show across the literature
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.220]   pretty much equal hypertrophy gains.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.420]   And we could have a really interesting discussion
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.780]   about why that is, but I'm just remembering one thing
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:44.640]   from a second ago.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.720]   I want to give a better answer for the frequency.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.600]   You can do every single week for strength
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.420]   or every single day for strength.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.360]   If you want though, like what's probably minimally viable,
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.880]   two, twice per week per muscle.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.240]   So hamstrings, strength twice per week.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.280]   That's a good number to get most people really strong.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.040]   You can do every single day.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:02.880]   You don't need to though.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.460]   So I want to make sure that, like I wasn't saying
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.880]   you have to train a muscle 85% every single day
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.740]   to get it strong.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.580]   Two is a good number.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.560]   Three is great, but probably even two is really effective.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.400]   - Got it.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.000]   And this explains the high frequency
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.180]   of training for strength athletes.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.000]   That's always mystified me.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.440]   And the very long workouts make sense
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.280]   because very long-
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.640]   - They're going to even train twice a day.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.680]   Like even though it's a squat,
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.200]   in the morning squat in the afternoon every day.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.280]   - With their eating and their sleeping,
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.720]   they probably don't have time for anything else.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.800]   - That's why they're pros.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.160]   So that's their job, right?
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.000]   That's what they do.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.260]   So yeah, hypertrophy.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:38.280]   Strength training programming is somewhat complicated,
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.440]   because of, that's not the danger,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.760]   but you're going to have to pay one way or the other, right?
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.900]   The risk is a little bit higher because the load's higher
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.680]   and you have to be a little bit more technically proficient.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.000]   When it comes to hypertrophy training,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.760]   the way I like to explain it is it's kind of idiot proof.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.040]   The programming is idiot proof.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.780]   The work is hard though.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.600]   So here's your range.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.280]   Anywhere between five reps and 30.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.200]   Can you hit somewhere in there?
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.040]   Perfect.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.860]   It's all equally effective.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.360]   You can't screw that up.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.040]   The only caveat for hypertrophy
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.820]   is you have to take it to muscular failure.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.640]   - And you need enough rest for the adaptation
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.080]   and protein synthesis to occur?
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:14.920]   - Yep.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.760]   - Yeah.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.580]   - And if you recover faster,
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.420]   you can maybe do it more frequently.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.460]   And if you don't, maybe less frequently.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.240]   - By that logic, should people perhaps experiment
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.880]   and figure out what repetition range allows them to recover
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.560]   in concert with the training frequency
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.840]   that they can do consistently?
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.800]   - My recommendation is I think you should actually set your,
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.200]   use the repetition range as a way to have some variation,
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.560]   because most people don't want to go in the gym
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.400]   and do three sets of 10.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.800]   They're going to get very bored very quickly.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.240]   And so I think you should actually intentionally change
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.940]   the rep schemes for simple sake of having more fun.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.080]   It is a very different challenge.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.280]   The mechanisms that are inducing hypertrophy are different,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.880]   but there's only a maximum amount of growth
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.760]   that one can get, right?
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.960]   And so you have, as best we think it now,
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.880]   and some people actually will espouse
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.420]   that we know really clearly about the mechanisms
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.160]   of muscle hypertrophy, we don't.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.920]   It's still very much a guessing game,
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.360]   but the three most likely drivers are one,
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.480]   metabolic stress, two, mechanical tension,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.960]   and then three, muscular damage.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.640]   You don't have to have all three.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.580]   One is sufficient.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.800]   You can have a little bit of one or two,
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.060]   and you can kind of, so you get it to play here.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.560]   We've already talked about the muscular damage.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.300]   Again, it's very clear, more damage is not better,
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:31.680]   but it is somewhat a decent proxy, right?
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.200]   Like again, a little bit of soreness is good.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.360]   You don't get so sore, it's compromising your total volume.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.640]   All right, mechanical tension is kind of like strength.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.820]   And this is why if you do even set to five or eight,
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.200]   and you're kind of close to that strength range,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.080]   you will gain a little bit of muscle.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   Not optimal muscle gain, but you're gonna gain some
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.680]   because everything in these,
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.520]   like physiology didn't cut off at four reps,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.080]   and then five reps is a different thing, right?
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.720]   It's always a blend, so think of it as like a fading curve.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.040]   As you get closer to the end, it fades less effective.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.200]   As you get closer to the middle, it's more effective.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.720]   Anywhere between eight reps per set to 30,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.680]   it's equally effective.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   Past 30, it's gonna blend out.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.800]   Past eight to five to four to three,
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.200]   it's gonna blend, you know, lesser there.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.800]   So metabolic stress is one, the damage is the other,
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.080]   or sorry, mechanical tension is the one that's heavy.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.240]   Muscle damage is the other one.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.120]   The third one is metabolic stress.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   And this is, I get a bit of an area of scientific contention
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.680]   but something's there.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.560]   I know something's there.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.440]   We're just kind of fumbling to figure out what exactly it is.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.220]   And this is, metabolic stress is the burn, right?
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.060]   It's there.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.200]   It's why blood flow restriction training probably works.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.460]   That's done very light, so there's no mechanical tension.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.820]   There's very little damage,
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.160]   but somehow it induces a good amount of hypertrophy.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.440]   - Very painful.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.280]   - Oh boy.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.560]   - I tried this, I have a friend, former special operator
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.640]   who was on the East Coast and took me through
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.480]   a blood flow restriction training protocol in a park.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.640]   And I don't think I actually cried.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.680]   - You probably did.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.240]   - But I might've cried out once or twice.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   It was unbelievable, especially the lower body movements.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.720]   Now it was a humid day.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.620]   I'll claim a little bit of jet lag, but it was brutal.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:15.800]   It was really brutal.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.640]   And I also-
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.920]   - Do it on the best day of your life and it's still brutal.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.200]   - Okay, well, that makes me feel a little bit better.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   It was intense and people should know
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.880]   that it is important to use the proper cuffs
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.700]   for these things.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.020]   I don't have any relationship to any of the companies
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.240]   that sell these cuffs.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.840]   But the reason is that you actually need to block
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.280]   particular avenues of blood flow.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.040]   You can't simply cinch off a muscle.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.080]   You can't tourniquet a muscle and train.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.800]   You can actually kill yourself that way.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.640]   - Yeah, you can get a blood clot.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.480]   - Yeah, and so if you're interested
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.960]   in blood flow restriction training,
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.340]   I imagine you have some content about this
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.200]   or will at some point, but also there are resources online
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.400]   that people can look up.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.680]   A question about hypertrophy training
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.780]   that I think many people are wondering about.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.880]   Train to failure or don't train to failure?
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.100]   Assuming good form.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.160]   - Yeah, okay, assuming good form, great.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.720]   The answer is both.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.680]   So you want to train to failure,
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.020]   but you don't need to go to extreme failure.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.520]   So you don't need to necessarily go to that like,
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.880]   a partner has to lift the barbell off my chest.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.780]   But you have to get close.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:21.780]   You have to drive either heavy, stress, damage, or pump.
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:26.080]   And so a really easy practical way to think about this,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.000]   I heard Mike Isritel, who runs a company
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.600]   called Renaissance Periodization years ago,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.220]   outline this at a NSCA talk.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.060]   And it was beautiful.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.380]   This is the most eloquent way to explain
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.100]   the context about training for hypertrophy.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.120]   So I want you to look for three things in your workout.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.540]   And let's say that you want a particular muscle to grow.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.420]   Let's say you want your glutes to get larger.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.660]   Okay, when you're doing your glute exercises,
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.840]   number one, are you feeling the glute contract?
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.000]   Okay, it doesn't have to be there,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.540]   but that's a good sign if it is.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.700]   Okay, let's say I didn't really feel my glute contract.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.960]   I felt it more in my quads or my back.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   Okay, did you feel a big pump afterwards?
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.840]   No, I didn't really feel a pump there either, or during.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.680]   Okay, great.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.120]   Number three, next day,
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.880]   did you feel a little bit of soreness there at all?
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.840]   No, I didn't.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.000]   Well, that's a very good indication.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.120]   You didn't feel it during the workout.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.720]   You felt no sort of pump and it didn't get sore.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.760]   Don't expect much growth.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.000]   Didn't happen. - You distributed the work
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.480]   across a bunch of muscle groups.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.060]   - Most likely other muscle groups were too involved, right?
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:23.900]   Especially if you're like,
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.400]   no, but man, my back got really,
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.740]   well, that's a really good indication
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.960]   of telling you what the hell was moving.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.500]   And so in terms of targets,
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.080]   if you were to put, again, a one to 10 scale,
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.680]   how much should I feel it burning during?
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.080]   Anything less than a three,
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.040]   okay, it's probably not doing much, right?
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.960]   But it doesn't, like seven is not,
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.600]   a 10 is not better than seven.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.320]   You need to feel it, but it doesn't have to be like,
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.540]   oh my gosh, I'm dying here.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.260]   Soreness, same barometer, right?
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.320]   So if you can get like three, three and three,
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.620]   you're probably in a pretty good spot.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.120]   Five, five and five is maybe better,
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.120]   but you don't need to go much past that.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.780]   So I want you to feel the muscle group either working,
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.140]   or if you're like, I didn't feel it much,
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:04.980]   I didn't really get a pump,
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.300]   but the next day it got really sore,
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.720]   well, then you're still, you know, you're on a good path.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.560]   Again, really sore as in like,
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.540]   oh, a little tender, but next day it's okay.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.600]   Day after that, I could train, no problem.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.320]   That's really what you want to go after.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.880]   And in terms of understanding,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.960]   is this likely to produce some growth or not?
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.580]   - Excellent, excellent,
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.360]   very clear parameters and recommendations I know
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.260]   are benefiting me and will benefit a lot of people.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.520]   If you'd be willing to throw out a few
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.760]   sort of sets and rep parameters
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.920]   that could act as broad guidelines
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.220]   for people who want to explore further,
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.060]   I realize that with all these modifiable variables,
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.920]   that there's no one size fits all, four strength.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.840]   I love this five to 30 for hypertrophy.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.680]   That's pretty vital thing.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.900]   I don't think I've ever done a 30 rep set of anything,
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.600]   but now that you've thrown that out there,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.440]   I see it as a bit of a challenge.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.500]   - You want to know what's awesome about 30?
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.380]   You're going to get an insane pump.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.620]   You're going to burn like crazy,
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.680]   but you won't get super sore.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.980]   Because the mechanical tension is so low, it's so light.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.480]   So you can get away with those things and you,
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.640]   it's hard because your mind is going to wander.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.920]   You're gonna get it like rep 20 and you're gonna be like,
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.760]   I'm done.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.340]   And you're like, no, there's a lot left here to get to 30.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.520]   Where like a set of 10 is much easier.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.240]   Like you're just like, okay, two more, two more.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.640]   Set of 30 is like, I got 16 more.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.480]   It's awful.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.320]   - Just the counting is worse.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.260]   - It's terrible, right?
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.040]   And people tend to just kind of like check out.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.200]   So 30 is possible, but a little bit extreme, extreme.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.860]   But I would recommend all of them.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.220]   Like it's a really fun play.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.920]   You can do different in the same workout too, by the way.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.760]   Like you could do one set of 10 pushups
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.560]   and then take a little break and then do a set of 25.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.680]   You can mix and match these things.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.820]   There's no magic recipe that has to happen for all those.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.660]   Or do it different.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.360]   So Mondays are my sets of 10 days.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.940]   Wednesdays are my set of 20 days.
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:51.040]   And Fridays are my set of 30 days.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.280]   And you can have all kinds of fun there
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.200]   and it's hard to screw up.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.240]   - Great.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.920]   That phrase is always reassuring.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.880]   So for strength, is there a sets and reps protocol
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.560]   that is pretty surefire?
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.040]   - So a way to just think about a really fast answer
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.840]   for power, well, speed, power, and strength
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.040]   is what I just call the three to five concept.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040]   So pick three to five exercises.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.200]   If you're feeling better that day, choose on the higher end.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.580]   If you're feeling less that day
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:24.260]   or you have a shorter timeframe to train, go less.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.180]   So this would be three sets or three exercises rather,
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.220]   or five exercises most.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.540]   So three to five exercises, do three to five reps,
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.800]   three to five sets, take three to five minutes rest
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.580]   in between and do it three to five times a week.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.140]   So that can be as little as three sets of three
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.120]   for three exercises, three times a week.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.300]   That's a 20 minute workout three times a week.
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.540]   It can be as high as five sets of five
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.120]   for five exercises, five days a week.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.640]   So it's very broad and allows people to still stay
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.360]   within the domains of strength and power
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.920]   while still being able to move and contour
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.320]   toward their lifestyle and soreness and time
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.340]   and all those things.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.080]   The only differentiator to pay attention to
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.540]   between power and strength is intensity.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.100]   So if you want strength,
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.520]   this is now 85% plus of your max, right?
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.720]   If you want power, it needs to be a lot lighter
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.240]   'cause you need to move more towards the velocity
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.080]   end of the spectrum
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.600]   because power is strength multiplied by speed.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.300]   So while getting stronger by definition can help power,
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.840]   you probably want to spend more of your time
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.840]   in the 40% to 70% range, like plus or minus.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.320]   So that's it.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.060]   Both of them conceptually they'll work everything else.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.880]   The exercise, the reps, the frequency,
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.020]   all that can be still in the three to five range.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:41.960]   Just change the intensity
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.700]   depending on which outcome you want.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:47.540]   - The nervous system obviously plays an important role
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.360]   at the level of nerves controlling
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.160]   the contraction of muscle fibers.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.360]   But of course we have these upper motor neurons,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.580]   which are the ones that reside in our brain
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.400]   that control the lower motor neurons that control muscle.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.100]   And this takes us into the realm of where the mind is at
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.120]   during a particular movement.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.080]   And to me, this is not an abstract thing.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.100]   I can imagine doing workouts
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.680]   that are mainly focused on strength
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.380]   or mainly focused on hypertrophy.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.320]   And in the case of strength,
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.380]   am I trying to move weights?
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.740]   And when I'm trying to generate hypertrophy,
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.400]   am I trying to "challenge muscles?"
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.480]   In other words, if I'm just trying to move a weight
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.500]   away from my body, pushing a bench press
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.040]   or an overhead press,
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.200]   I don't know that I want my mind
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.280]   thinking about the contraction of my medial delts.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.100]   I think I want my mind in getting the weight overhead
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.900]   with the best proper form.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.440]   Best, excuse me, and proper form.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.380]   And certainly with hypertrophy training,
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.120]   best improper form is going to be the target as well.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.120]   But that simple, or I should say subtle mental shift
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.800]   changes the patterns of nerve fiber recruitment.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.660]   So can we say to get stronger, focus on moving weights,
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.480]   still with proper form and safely,
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.900]   and to get hypertrophy, focus on challenging muscles,
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.700]   still with proper form and safely?
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.180]   - It's very fair.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:17.000]   As a snapshot answer, it is a very fair thing to think about.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.120]   Intentionality matters for both.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.300]   In other words, if you look at some interesting science
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:26.480]   that's been done on power development and speed development,
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.840]   the intent to move is actually more important
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.500]   than the actual movement velocity.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.260]   So if you're doing, say, something for power or strength,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:38.000]   and you're doing just enough to get the bar up,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.580]   that will result in less improvements in strength
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.180]   than even if you're moving at the exact same speed,
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.480]   but you're intending to move faster.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.260]   And this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.520]   So if you're coaching an athlete
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.560]   through a power workout especially,
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.880]   and they're doing enough to just lift 50%
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.720]   of their one rep max,
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.820]   it's not going to generate as much speed development
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.320]   as them trying to move that bar as fast as they can,
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.560]   even if the net result is the same bar by velocity.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.420]   Turns out nerves matter.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.540]   - That's, I mean, I was about to say amazing,
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.520]   but as a neuroscientist, if I say amazing,
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.360]   that nerves matter.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.040]   What's amazing to me is what, if I understand correctly,
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.740]   what you're saying is that even if the bar is moving
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.360]   at the same speed, same weight,
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.700]   if my internal representation, my thoughts are,
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:24.080]   I'm trying to move this as fast as possible
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.200]   versus I'm just trying to get the bar away from me
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.720]   and get the weight up, I'm going to get different outcomes.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.120]   - Yep, this is quality of work, right?
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.400]   This is, did you do enough to just check off the box
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.020]   or did you actually strive for adaptation, right?
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.760]   Similar concept actually works for hypertrophy
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.160]   in terms of there is a handful of very recent studies
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.000]   that have looked at what we'll call
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.720]   the mind-muscle connection.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.560]   And this is doing things like, imagine a bicep curl.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.120]   And you're simply looking at and watching your biceps
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.820]   and you're thinking about contracting it harder.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.520]   Even though you execute the same repetitions
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.240]   at the same exact intensity, initial indications are
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.440]   the mind-body connection are going to result
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.120]   in more growth than not.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.500]   - You just gave authorization for people
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500]   to look at their muscles contracting in the gym.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.340]   - Please do, please do, yeah, of course, right?
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.380]   - But the selfie is still ruled out.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.700]   - I'd rather you look at your muscles than your phone.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.060]   So I'm fine with it.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.500]   Those are initial.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.740]   We don't have a large depth of research to support that
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.800]   and maybe some stuff will come and counter it.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.980]   But it does, it matches what folks in that community
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.700]   have been saying for a very long time, right?
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.960]   There's actually some stuff on simply flexing in between.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.480]   So if you've ever seen a bodybuilder,
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.940]   they'll do their set of bicep curls
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.320]   and then they'll get out and they'll flex and they'll check.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.120]   And they're literally, this is what Arnold did, right?
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.760]   This is, if you go back to pumping an iron.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.160]   - Or college weight rooms, I should say.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.600]   For some reason, there's something about that age group.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.720]   There's a lot of checking of biceps in college weight rooms
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.240]   for reasons that escape me.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.840]   - If you ever interact with my wife,
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.940]   she will be the first to tell you,
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.720]   I cannot walk past a mirror without like,
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.560]   I'm checking something out.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560]   - That you can't or that she can't?
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.400]   - I can't, I can't.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.240]   - Okay.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.060]   - Not her, me.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:04.900]   Like I'm the one that cannot walk past.
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:05.740]   - All right, well then I'll be careful
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.560]   not to disparage that.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.360]   - It has nothing to do with the hypertrophy,
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.880]   but I'm just like, I'm a muscle gas.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.360]   I'm always like thinking and tinkering or whatever.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.200]   But yeah, it is, I think it's very much worth your time
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.440]   to do a higher quality training session,
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.560]   be more intentional, be present,
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.520]   than just executing the same exact workout.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.560]   I think that's globally very clear to be to your advantage.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.440]   So if you're thinking, like, I'm going to,
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.080]   like, I don't want to work out today.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.800]   I got all this going on or I'm tired or whatever.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.240]   I'm just going to do the workout anyways and get through it.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.880]   Okay, if you can go, you know what though?
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.800]   Like, I'm going to cut 15 minutes out of this thing.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.760]   I'm going to get my head right.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.760]   I'm going to go to 20 minutes of quality work done.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.580]   That's your best option by far.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.380]   - You alluded to the fact that
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.000]   even just looking at a particular muscle
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.720]   might benefit in terms of the number of fibers
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.560]   you can recruit or its potential for hypertrophy.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.480]   I've heard before, and I certainly have experienced it,
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.680]   muscles that, for whatever reason,
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.020]   genetics or sports that one played, et cetera,
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.920]   muscles that we find that we can contract
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.520]   to the point of almost a slightly painful contraction
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.400]   seem to grow more readily
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.680]   than muscles that we can't recruit very easily.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.040]   And the reason I mentioned sports that we played earlier
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.240]   is I've been, you just have to watch the Olympics
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.840]   to see that, you know, swimmers obviously
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.640]   are very good at engaging their lats.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.340]   You look at the gymnasts,
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.240]   they seem to be very good at engaging everything,
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.460]   and they go through a huge number
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.640]   of different dynamic movements.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.660]   That explains that.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:41.400]   So I find that, you know, if people say,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.160]   oh, you know, I can't get stronger in this
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.020]   or my whatever body part is weak
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.040]   in terms of its inability to engage hypertrophy,
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.200]   that oftentimes that can be
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:54.480]   because of an inability to engage those upper motor neurons
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.360]   to deliberately isolate those muscles.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.720]   Are there ways that people can learn
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.320]   to engage particular muscle groups more effectively
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.800]   over time for sake of hypertrophy or strength,
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.560]   or for cases of trying to overcome injury potential
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.880]   or injury because imbalances are bad across the board?
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.400]   - Yeah, this is actually very common,
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.080]   and I think everyone has probably gone through this.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   There's some part that you just can't get going.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.580]   For me, that was the lats.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.520]   That was the rhomboids, so my back muscles.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.840]   For years, I couldn't activate my lats or my rhomboids.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.920]   These are the muscle groups
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.080]   that connect your shoulder blades.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.920]   So if you try to squeeze your shoulder blades together,
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.240]   that set of muscles there are called your rhomboids.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.040]   Your lats, of course, are more vertical
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.680]   and pull you kind of up and down.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.960]   No matter how many lat pull-downs I did, bent rows,
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.200]   pull-ups, I could never see any development there,
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.800]   no increase in strength,
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.400]   and it took me probably a decade to figure out
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.880]   how the hell to actually get these things on.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.880]   In fact, if you would have asked me,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.600]   even in my college years as a college football player,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.380]   hey, flex your lats, like show me your lats,
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.280]   you would have seen no movement there.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.300]   When I was doing a pull-up in that particular case,
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.620]   the only way I could get the bar to move
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.520]   was by using my biceps, right?
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.640]   So it's a synergistic muscle.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.760]   It's supposed to be a secondary or tertiary muscle
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.160]   in that movement, but for me, it was primer
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.700]   because of my overstrength in my biceps
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.080]   coupled with my lack of activation in the lats.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.980]   So you're compensating the same movement.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.600]   Actually, kind of an easy way to think about this
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.240]   is imagine doing a bent row.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.580]   So imagine you're bent over kind of at a 45 degree
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.800]   or a horizontal angle, and you're gonna pull a barbell
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.540]   to your belly button, all right?
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.440]   Now you can actually do that exact same movement
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.520]   with very little back muscle activation
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.460]   by simply flexing your elbows more.
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.440]   And so you think the barbell's going all the way down,
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.220]   it's coming all the way up to touching my belly,
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.040]   and you think you're doing
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.420]   a great back development exercise,
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.860]   when in fact, because of the way
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.540]   that you're executing the movement,
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.380]   you're getting very little back development.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.140]   And this is a really good example
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.720]   of why someone has done a specific exercise
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.020]   many, many, many times,
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.980]   but yet failed to see development in a muscle group,
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.140]   which goes back to earlier part of our conversation,
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.740]   which is why exercises themselves
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.840]   do not determine the adaptation.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.000]   It's the execution that matters, right?
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.740]   It's the technique, it's the rep range.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.720]   All of those are gonna determine your actual result.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.760]   So if any time you're banging your head against the wall
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.200]   and thinking like, why am I not getting movement here,
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.940]   growth or strength or whatever,
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.260]   it's almost one of those, it's guaranteed
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.280]   to be one of those areas, right?
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.060]   You're probably not getting the muscle groups to activate.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.980]   In that particular example, just because we're here,
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.100]   try, imagine doing that bent row.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.400]   Instead of pulling the barbell to your belly,
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.380]   squeeze your shoulder blades together first,
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.260]   as far as they can possibly go,
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.820]   and then bring your elbows up
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:43.320]   without changing the angle of your elbow.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.160]   So in other words,
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.180]   without bringing your hand closer to your shoulder.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.100]   So keep that same angle
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.140]   and come up as high as you possibly can,
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.680]   and then finish out the movement.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.520]   That's going to guarantee a utilization first
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.660]   of the back muscles and a finishing with the biceps
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:00.620]   at the end, which is how that movement is supposed to go.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.060]   So how do you coach into that?
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.460]   Well, it can be a number of things.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.800]   Whenever I'm diagnosing movement quality,
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.380]   I look for a handful of things,
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.880]   but very first one is awareness.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.620]   You'd be surprised how many folks,
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.460]   when you just simply tell them,
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.500]   that muscle group right there,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500]   and maybe you give them a tactical prompt,
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.820]   so you touch it or you put something against it.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.180]   This is actually why, sorry, I'm jumping over the place,
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.140]   but this is why things like a belt work very well
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.860]   for actually increasing abdominal strength.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.300]   So a misconception out there is if you wear like a belt
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.560]   when you're lifting,
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.340]   then the belt kind of does all the work for you
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.940]   and your abs get weaker.
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:39.920]   That can happen, but the exact opposite can happen as well.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.800]   So if you take a belt, for example,
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.820]   and you cinch it down really tight,
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.360]   and then you just completely disregard your midsection,
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.900]   you will see a loss of strength in your midsection
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.520]   because now the belt is doing the work.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.800]   But if you put the belt on just a little bit,
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.660]   kind of tight, to where you get some sensory feedback
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:58.480]   and you think about using that belt
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.520]   as a way to activate the core musculature,
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.660]   you will actually see a higher,
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.160]   and if we look at like EMG activation,
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.660]   the core muscles would be activated higher
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.540]   to a greater extent than when the belt is off.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.060]   - Because of proprioceptive feedback.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:11.900]   - 100%.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.500]   - And for those that are wondering
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.940]   what proprioceptive feedback is,
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.940]   proprioceptive feedback is that there are nerves
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.220]   that extend out to the muscles
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.440]   that control muscle contractions,
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.180]   but then there are sensory inputs from the skin and muscle
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.560]   that go back into the nervous system
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.820]   and those work in concert,
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.780]   and that feedback is proprioceptive.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:31.300]   I think it literally translates to a knowledge
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.380]   of where one's limbs are and what's happening on those.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.540]   - In space, yeah.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.460]   - I've seen, I don't have a training partner,
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.300]   but I've seen in gyms where someone will be training
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   and someone would tap the muscle
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.140]   of the person who's doing the work in order with,
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.220]   this is consensual tapping of other people's muscles,
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.860]   not walking around touching people's muscles, please,
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.400]   to provide that proprioceptive feedback
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.380]   so that the person doing the exercises,
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.540]   it becomes more aware of the muscle
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.680]   that they're supposed to be training,
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.500]   and it seems that that's probably an effective practice.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.660]   - Yeah, I'll give you two examples.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.300]   I'll go to the back with that pulling movement,
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.900]   but then I'll stay on the belt really quickly.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.500]   So a very easy example that you can do right now listening,
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.800]   and I learned this from Brian McKenzie,
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.900]   our mutual friend, right?
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.300]   So if you take your hands and open them up,
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.940]   like you make an L with both your hands,
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:23.180]   and I'll take those and put them around your waist
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.140]   just above your hip bones.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.760]   Now, what I want you to do is press out as hard as you can
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.780]   on your hands with your core,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.980]   and you can feel a lot of core activation.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.540]   And most people think core activation
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.660]   is the front of your stomach, right, your six pack.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.740]   What you need to do is create a cylinder around your back.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.340]   So it's the front, it's the side, and it's the back.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.940]   So if you take your two fingers, point them.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.300]   Now put them just outside your belly button.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:51.460]   Can you move your fingers by just moving your ab muscles?
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.800]   90% of people can do yes.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.060]   Same exact thing.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.700]   Now go to that same position
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.700]   just above what's called your ASIS,
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.260]   so your anterior superior iliac spine,
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:03.600]   right up that front of your hip bone, right in the front.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.580]   Can you now move?
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.800]   Great, 50% of people are not gonna get any movement there.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.640]   - Really?
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.920]   - So take your thumb and go right above your PSIS.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.760]   - My what?
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.880]   - PSIS, posterior superior iliac spine, right?
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.160]   Now, can you move?
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.720]   Most likely no.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.800]   - Sort of if I do a mini little back extension.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.220]   - Don't, just with your core musculature.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.020]   - Barely.
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.480]   - Yeah, 90% of people can't.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.080]   If you can't perform that contraction,
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.120]   you can't stabilize your spine.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.360]   So only way to get stabilization in your spine
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.160]   is then to go through hyperextension.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.580]   And now that's a compression strategy
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.480]   you're putting on your spine,
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.380]   it's better than rounding your back, like going forward,
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.840]   but overextension is not great either.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.040]   So you wanna be able to flex the musculature
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.800]   in a cylindric fashion so you have control.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.240]   So if you go back to our very first things
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.120]   and with your hands open and you put them right here,
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.480]   and if you're like, I can't get activation,
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.240]   if you pay attention to your thumb, right?
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.480]   Now just move your thumb.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:07.040]   And now you see activation back there, right?
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.400]   Boom, now if you can imagine
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.360]   turning that on just a little bit,
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.460]   and now notice how I can do this, by the way,
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:14.220]   at the same time I'm talking.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:17.600]   If you have to go, (grunting)
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.480]   we don't have control, right?
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.680]   So you have to be able to separate breath from brace.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   So now if I can put myself in a position,
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.320]   and Kelly Starrett has always said 20%,
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.440]   give me 20% activation here,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.600]   and now I can squat, I can hinge, I can jump.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.400]   I don't need to be locked down to 100% scream
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.820]   to be able to brace my spine.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.000]   It's gonna be ineffective and wasteful.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.060]   I wanna be here.
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.560]   Well, the belt provides that proprioceptive feedback
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.900]   where I can put it on 20%, and it just is a reminder,
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.320]   if I don't press against the belt,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.920]   the belt slides and falls down a little bit
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.480]   'cause it's not on super tight.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.880]   If it's on so dang tight, it's doing the work and I forget.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:57.060]   So we just want a little bit of feedback there.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.400]   Same thing with your upper back.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.380]   If you're having a difficult time
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.740]   activating those rhomboids or those lats,
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.040]   someone can do a simple thing where they take their finger,
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.860]   put it right between your shoulder blades,
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.020]   and you just tell them things like,
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:09.260]   hey, squeeze my finger, squeeze my finger.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.560]   As you're doing your bent row or your pull down,
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.040]   you can touch the lat.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.160]   You can do just visualization stuff.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.320]   So just imagine like a 3D rendering of that muscle group,
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.960]   and you're watching that muscle group contract.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.320]   It's very powerful and very effective to do it.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.920]   So a touch, a visual, all this stuff can help
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.500]   get people to activate.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.660]   Outside of simple awareness,
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.800]   typically eccentric overload is a very effective way
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.060]   for activation of a difficult to target muscle.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:41.180]   So the lowering of the bar or the lowering of the weight.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.640]   The movement of the weight away from the body
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.020]   is not necessarily always lowering
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:46.020]   'cause that kind of depends on what
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:47.220]   muscle group you're doing, right?
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.060]   I misspoke, yeah.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.460]   Things like a pull up.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.560]   Okay, so if I'm going to do a pull up
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.780]   and I have poor lat activation,
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.040]   I can still get the pull up muscle movement
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.840]   executed by contraction of the biceps and things like that.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.940]   However, to make the movement simpler,
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.460]   I'm gonna go all the way to the top.
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.060]   So imagine stepping on a box or something,
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.360]   going all the way to that top of that pull up position.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.200]   And starting from there,
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.460]   I want you to simply lower it under control.
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.420]   And so you're just simply breaking the movement down
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.740]   into smaller pieces that allow you
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.600]   to focus on the execution more.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.440]   It's gonna be great.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.380]   Eccentrics are great for strength development,
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.020]   very good for hypertrophy,
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:23.640]   and allow you to focus on control.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.580]   I'm willing to bet a huge percentage of you out there
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.480]   who've like, I've never had a sore lat.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.860]   You know, I've done a lot of pull ups and things like that.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.180]   If you do that eccentric only,
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.380]   you'll probably wake up the next day going,
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:36.580]   oh gosh, I feel it there.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:37.420]   And that's a sign,
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.460]   even if you didn't feel it in the workout,
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.860]   but I got a little sore the next day,
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.940]   keep down that path.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:45.220]   And then eventually you'll be able to do a concentric,
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:46.580]   maybe take a break,
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.340]   maybe do an isometric where you just hold that position,
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.100]   and eventually work that into a progression
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.260]   where you can do the concentric,
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.100]   eccentric and isometric portions and get activation.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:59.120]   So that may take you six weeks,
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.640]   may take you six months,
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.000]   but that's generally a pretty good strategy
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.980]   for learning how to activate a muscle group.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.240]   - Terrific suggestions.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.940]   Is it true that eccentric emphasized movements
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.000]   might require a little bit longer recovery
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.560]   or they lead to more soreness than concentric movements?
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.720]   - Yeah, they typically can,
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.920]   but they're also higher force output.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.280]   So very good for strength development,
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.520]   but they're going to lead on average to more soreness.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.840]   So more potential for intracellular disruption,
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.180]   that is going to be associated with pain.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.340]   There's not as much,
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:31.220]   people will like to explain muscle soreness
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.180]   as a result of microtrauma and micro tears in the muscle.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:36.500]   That can happen, but that's not the norm.
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:40.660]   Most of the time it is things like disruption of calcium,
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:42.500]   that's going to lead to excessive swelling,
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:43.320]   excessive pressure,
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.820]   and that's going to be then translated as extreme pain.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.980]   So that's probably explaining more of muscle soreness
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.820]   than actually microtrauma.
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:51.660]   - Terrific.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.340]   I was going to get to breathing later,
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.820]   but maybe just for now,
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:59.820]   if we can do a brief little foray into breathing
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:02.620]   as it relates to weight training.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.920]   Is there a prescriptive for how to breathe
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.960]   during resistance training?
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.460]   Here I'm thinking with weights,
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.280]   not necessarily body weight only movements,
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.600]   although I suppose it could be,
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.440]   that applies 75% of the time to 75% of the people.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.320]   What I was taught,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.920]   and I'm hoping you're going to tell me this was wrong,
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.520]   'cause then there might be more benefits awaiting me,
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.480]   is that I should exhale on the effort
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   and inhale on the lesser effort portion of an exercise.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.500]   Is that true?
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.160]   Is there a better way to breathe?
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.560]   - There is a better way to think about it.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.200]   So number one, if you can breathe and brace,
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.960]   then this conversation goes away.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.880]   So if you can maintain intramuscular,
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.720]   intra-abdominal pressure while breathing,
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.980]   then I don't really care when you breathe.
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.240]   Very challenging to do at very heavy weights.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.040]   If we flag this on two areas of a paradigm,
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.400]   paradigm one over here, you're gonna do a set of 30,
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.480]   and you're gonna do front squats
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.280]   where a barbell is sitting on your throat.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.280]   If you don't take a breath,
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.320]   this is going to end one way and one way only,
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.820]   you passing out.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.280]   Clearly has to be some breathing strategy.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.400]   The other end of the spectrum is,
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.520]   let's say you're gonna do a vertical jump.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.960]   You don't need any amount of breath there.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.160]   It's never gonna happen, right?
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.720]   The question is, what about in the middle, right?
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.740]   So I'm doing some sort of strength training there.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.680]   Well, number one, make sure you're braced
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.160]   and then you can get away with less need to worry about it.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:38.480]   In general, a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.440]   during the lowering or eccentric
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.920]   or most dangerous part of the movement,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.000]   and then you can exhale on the concentric portion.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.160]   So if the bench press is our example,
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.600]   if you held in, braced, lowered under control,
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.520]   and now started the concentric pushing away force,
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.480]   and then you wanted to take an expiration,
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.880]   during the last half of the concentric portion,
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.800]   that's an okay strategy.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.040]   If you're going to do a single rep,
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.500]   you don't need to worry about it.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.800]   You can just avoid or omit breathing entirely.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.840]   You're gonna be just fine.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.140]   If you're doing more than that,
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:09.720]   especially three to four to five to seven, eight,
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.720]   you're gonna have to have some breathing strategy.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:16.080]   A very common one is probably every third breath.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.680]   I'm gonna do like, (gasps)
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.720]   exhale on the third, reset, re-breathe,
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.560]   something like that.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.280]   If you feel like you need to breathe after every one,
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.760]   that's okay, but it's gonna get wasteful
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.840]   'cause you have to take time in between reps
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.680]   of sitting there.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.880]   If it's a squat, that's different,
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.740]   versus a deadlift if you're resting at the bottom.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:35.280]   So there is a little bit of game here.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.120]   So in general, though, is that 75,
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.480]   75 kind of really thrown out, you threw out.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.280]   Breathe in through the lowering and exhale on the out
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.560]   if you have to.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.880]   Less reps, don't worry about it.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.240]   More reps, then you need to come up
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.800]   with some sort of breathing strategy.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.960]   - How about breathing in between sets
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:56.440]   and maybe even after the workout?
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.060]   This is something I think a lot of people overlook.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:04.060]   And because it is the case that recovery has to do
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:07.600]   both with the specific activation to muscles
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.320]   and the nervous system, but also the attacks
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.820]   on the nervous system can also take place between sets.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.580]   I mean, if you're really geared up between sets
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:17.780]   and you've got adrenaline as high in between sets
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.580]   or close to it as you are during your sets,
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.060]   you can imagine that the recovery would take longer,
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.480]   or at least that you're not spending adrenaline
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.080]   in the most efficient way if there is such a thing.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.560]   - Yeah, fair.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.080]   You're not going to see any athlete that I work with
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:33.860]   just breathe in between.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.360]   Whether it's in between innings or in between rounds,
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.240]   every single one of them is going to go back,
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.960]   sit in the stool, and they're going to immediately
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.480]   be into a breathing routine.
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.380]   A very intentional one.
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.800]   They're a little bit different for every athlete,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.240]   depending on the sport.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:49.020]   Even a PGA golfer, there's going to be a,
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.460]   we just hit our ball, we're moving to the next one,
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:53.000]   we're going to go into a breathing strategy.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:53.840]   Every one of them.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:56.500]   It's a huge area of potential benefit
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.840]   and consequence if you're just ignoring it.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:03.940]   In general, we want to do any sort of calming breath
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:04.780]   we want to restore.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.920]   It depends on if the, it depends on what we're combating.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.360]   Are we combating low oxygen or high CO2?
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.960]   So that strategy is going to be a little bit different.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.000]   But in general, that is a huge time opportunity
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:16.840]   to get better.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.280]   In fact, people can go back and listen
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.620]   to some of your earlier episodes where you talked about,
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:26.000]   where you have spoken about, I think, on this show,
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.320]   when neuroplasticity works.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.040]   And if you're losing that opportunity post-exercise,
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.920]   you're leaving gains on the table, if you will.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.680]   So not only are you going to see everything athletes
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.960]   that I work with mostly have a breathing strategy
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:42.760]   in competition, we're not going to just finish a workout
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.960]   high five, drink water and walk out of the gym.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.640]   There will be a down regulation strategy
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.800]   that is heavily involved with some sort of light control
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.120]   as well as breath control.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.660]   The individual prescription on that,
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.480]   there's a ton of variation with what you can do.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.260]   The easiest thing is do something that calms you down.
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.000]   Most likely that's going to be moved towards
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.800]   as much nasal breathing as you can possibly do.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:08.360]   And a really easy rule of thumb is a double exhale length
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.540]   relative to inhale.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:12.720]   So if you need to take a like four second inhale,
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.480]   double that time and breathe out for eight seconds.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.760]   A box breathing is fine.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:21.300]   So equal inhale, equal hold, equal exhale, equal hold.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.680]   So four second inhale, four second exhale,
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.320]   hold, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.540]   A triangle is fine too.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:29.680]   There's a lot of ways you can get really complicated.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.360]   Like what Brian McKenzie will do and Rob,
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.860]   those guys have, you can get all kinds of systems
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.880]   for inhale, exhale control, it can be optimized.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.680]   But some strategy of calm.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.080]   We're going to almost always put you on your back or close,
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.360]   and then we're going to cover light.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.680]   We can do some, like we've done actually
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:50.260]   a number of musical interventions as well,
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.720]   but you can as simple as sit down in the locker room
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.800]   if you have to and just breathe for five minutes.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.500]   That alone is going to be productive.
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.340]   - That's great.
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:03.660]   If you're breathing in the locker room for five minutes,
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:05.880]   I suggest closing your eyes or you get some funny looks.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.480]   And if you'll still get funny looks,
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.640]   but you won't see people looking at you.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:09.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.680]   - I love this.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.560]   And I started doing this because you and Brian McKenzie
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.260]   informed me about this and it completely changed
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.200]   the rate of recovery for me.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.120]   I realized that I was leaving workouts,
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.820]   both endurance workouts and strength hypertrophy workouts,
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:26.200]   feeling great, but looking at my phone,
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.200]   getting right into email and meetings,
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.680]   not concentrating on my breathing.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.800]   And all I did was to introduce on your recommendation,
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.980]   a five minute down regulation.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:37.420]   So exhale, emphasize breathing,
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.340]   a bunch of different varieties, physiological size,
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.700]   box breathing, exhale, emphasize twice as long
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.620]   as the inhale component for five minutes.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.620]   And I noticed two things.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.400]   One, I recovered more quickly, workout to workout,
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.920]   no question about it.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.860]   The numbers told me that.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:57.340]   And the other is that I used to have this dip in energy
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.700]   that would occur three or four hours after a hard workout.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.300]   And I always thought that had to do with the fact
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.660]   that I generally eaten a meal at some point post-workout.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.200]   Turns out it wasn't the meal at all.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.540]   It's that adrenaline ramp up during the workouts.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.760]   I wasn't clamping that at the end.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.980]   And so I think eventually it just crashed.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:17.180]   And then three or four hours later,
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.140]   I'm having a hard time even reading
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.340]   what's on the screen of my computer,
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.340]   thinking maybe it's the screen,
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:22.300]   maybe it was what I ate for lunch.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.460]   It turns out the down regulations allowed me
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:29.260]   to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.780]   It's really been quite powerful.
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.180]   And so I'm grateful to you for that.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.020]   And I think this is something
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:36.500]   that I think 98% of people are not doing.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:37.740]   And it's only five minutes.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.140]   - You didn't even have to do five.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.500]   Give me three.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.640]   If you really have to push it, give me three.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.560]   And you can even do this.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.560]   You can save time.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.400]   You can do this in the shower if you have to.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.680]   So you're done, you're finished.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.080]   Drink of water, whatever it has to be.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.360]   And you're getting in a shower, getting ready.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.240]   Just give me three minutes in the shower.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.640]   It's not ideal, but as little as that.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.240]   It can pay huge dividends.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.680]   You need some sort of internal signal that we're safe.
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:06.860]   Like throttle down here and we're going to move on.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.840]   That has to happen.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.760]   I get going on and on here,
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.880]   but I think we're making the same point
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.720]   kind of over and over again.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.760]   It's a big deal and do it.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.080]   - Yeah, and you're saving energy.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.000]   I mean, the energy here is neural energy.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.140]   I think fighters do this,
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.380]   good fighters learn to do this between rounds.
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.840]   Sprinters learn to do this between events.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.480]   I think humans should learn how to do this
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.440]   between any sort of interval type activity,
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.640]   including work, social engagement.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.580]   I mean, this is such a powerful tool.
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:37.060]   Do this for one minute after every important,
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:40.640]   whether it's an individual high volatile interaction,
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.440]   or if you just did a nice 45 minute sprint to work
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.260]   and you're deep into it or whatever, fine.
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:46.940]   Just give me one minute.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.460]   Set your alarm, just one minute.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:51.300]   And that also will pay dividends.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:52.140]   - I love it.
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:55.460]   And as I said, it's made a outsize different,
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.380]   positive difference on my training,
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.740]   but also activities outside my training,
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.640]   which is for me, I'm not a professional athlete.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.660]   I trained for health and because I enjoy it,
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:06.920]   but when a really hard workout starts to interfere
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.800]   with the ability to do the other things in life,
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.320]   that's not a good situation.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.820]   So this is really terrific.
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:15.560]   There's a lot more in each of those categories of strength
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.460]   and hypertrophy, but you've given us a tremendous amount
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.240]   of valuable information there.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.340]   Maybe now would be a good time to shift to endurance.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:26.100]   And of the four types of endurance,
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.260]   and maybe you could remind us what those are.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.500]   What do you think are the two that most people
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:35.780]   are seeking or pursuing in terms of health and aesthetics?
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.620]   I mean, I realize that we probably have athletes
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:38.460]   out there as well,
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.940]   but I think when I think health and aesthetics,
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:43.620]   I think, okay, the ability to do sustained endurance,
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:47.700]   30 plus minutes of some ongoing activity,
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:50.260]   how does one maximize that work?
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.340]   What are the modifiable variables?
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:53.160]   And then maybe you could tell us
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.700]   what the other major category is
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.740]   that people ought to have in their kit.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:37:59.820]   Okay.
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.460]   So starting off with exercise choice.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:05.300]   One thing, as soon as we cross into the endurance world,
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.220]   and this is true for all four of those categories,
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:10.540]   exercise choice needs to be very concerned
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:11.700]   with eccentric landing.
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:14.580]   So you don't need to avoid it,
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:17.180]   but you need to recognize it relative
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:20.140]   or compare it against those other strength and speed ones.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.860]   The volume is low on those ones.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.460]   So if you have some eccentric absorption, it's okay.
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:26.340]   But as we sort of talked about five minutes ago,
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.980]   more eccentric means greater chance of muscle damage,
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.820]   soreness.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:33.980]   So if you take something and magnify it across 30 minutes
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   or even five minutes, but of maximum exertion,
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:40.120]   you have a recipe for blowing up.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.220]   You can imagine I haven't run in forever,
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.540]   and I've listened to this Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:47.260]   and I'm, okay, I'm gonna get into my zone two training,
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.500]   whatever it is, whatever.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.340]   And I start jogging, I'm gonna do,
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:52.540]   I remember when I used to be able to do 25,
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:54.660]   and you just do a 25 minute jog.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.780]   The amount of eccentric landing that just occurred
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.740]   on every single step, because you're never,
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.720]   with running, even slow running,
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.620]   you never have two feet on the ground at the same time.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.820]   So it is a one foot land, one foot land,
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:08.540]   your entire body mass plus gravity onto one leg at a time,
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:11.180]   repeated now hundreds of times.
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:14.600]   That eccentric landing is gonna cause tremendous soreness.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.300]   Your quads are gonna go,
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.420]   you're probably gonna get shin splints,
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.740]   which is what, those are entirely caused
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.620]   by eccentric landing,
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:25.340]   and when the tissue is not ready to tolerate that.
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.620]   If you're not landing correctly,
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.560]   this is when knee pain happens, back pain,
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.500]   shoulder neck pain, 'cause of movement compensation.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.620]   So anytime we start pressing to fatigue,
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.380]   let's be very concerned with there.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:40.000]   So my initial recommendation is start with activities,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.100]   exercise choice wise, that are mostly concentric based.
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.480]   So think about a cycle.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.080]   So when you're riding on a bike, you're pushing the pedal,
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.940]   but you're never landing and absorbing it.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.340]   So you could go out and do a 45 minute bike ride,
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.860]   and you're not gonna get that sore
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.340]   because there's not a lot of eccentric load.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:57.740]   Swimming, similar thing here, right?
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.900]   There's some eccentrics when your hand hits the water,
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.540]   but fairly minimal.
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:04.740]   It's mostly a push, push, push, push, push, no load.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:08.640]   Rowing, similar thing, mostly concentric.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.260]   Pushing a sled is fantastic.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:14.640]   Going uphill, running, or even walking hard uphill,
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.620]   all good 'cause they're very minimal landing
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:18.580]   relative to like running downhill,
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:21.580]   which would be a very, very bad idea to start.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:25.460]   So if you're first jumping into these things,
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:28.960]   progress your volume for endurance very slowly
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.060]   if it involves eccentric landing.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:33.420]   A really bad strategy would be to jump in
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.860]   and do say circuit training class
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:38.300]   that involves a bunch of box jumps, right?
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:43.300]   This is not a good way to do your first foray
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.940]   into conditioning.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:46.140]   You're going to get incredibly sore
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.940]   because you're jumping and landing.
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:51.540]   You're now looking at three to 10 X body weight
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:53.280]   in terms of absorption with a single land,
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.880]   even if you're just jumping.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.760]   So be careful of that in any of those endurance areas
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:40:59.960]   of exercise choice.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.500]   So what to pick?
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.900]   Pick the one that you are most technically proficient in
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.060]   because you're going to do it a lot.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.200]   It's going to be a lot of repetitions.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.980]   Whatever one you feel the most joy in.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.100]   If that's rowing, great.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.100]   If that's pushing a sled, it doesn't really matter.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.840]   You can do this actually with weights.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.320]   This is our preferred way, by the way, with our athletes.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.660]   So we might do a 30 minute circuit
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:22.640]   where we do a five minute farmer's carry
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.480]   with a pretty light weight.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.240]   So you're just going to carry some weights in your hand
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.400]   and you're just going to walk up and down the street
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.440]   for five minutes.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.320]   You're going to set that down
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.000]   and then you're going to do say a three minute plank.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:31.880]   And then you're going to pick that up
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:34.220]   and you're going to do body weight squats,
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.760]   like slowly and just tempo.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.640]   And you're going to do a handful of different exercises
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.040]   so the athletes don't get super bored.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:42.680]   Or a very simple one, if a 30 minute workout,
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:45.320]   10 minutes on a treadmill, 10 minutes on a bike,
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.560]   10 minutes on a rower.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.440]   And for those of you that are like,
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.720]   oh my God, I can't do 30 straight minutes of running.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.060]   Cool, break it up into three or four different exercises
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.560]   that are all fairly safe.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.800]   So that's how I would do that long duration piece
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.860]   for exercise choice.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:00.360]   - And then in terms of heart rate during that period,
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.440]   I mean, how much tension should we pay to this?
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.440]   The kind of very broad prescriptive I've thrown out
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.540]   on this podcast a few times
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:07.680]   based on my read of the literature
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.220]   is for most people that are oriented toward health,
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:12.060]   including people that are working on size
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:15.560]   and strength gains, hypertrophy and strength, of course,
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:19.240]   that getting 150 to 180 minutes of so-called zone two cardio
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:23.360]   can just barely have a conversation.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.600]   But if one were to push any harder,
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.640]   you wouldn't be able to, that kind of thing.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.880]   It's just as a generic recommendation
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.640]   that almost everybody should follow
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:34.240]   in order to just keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.120]   But I know there's a lot of nuance there.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.080]   And some people would like to be able to run continuously
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.120]   for an hour at speed, right?
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.200]   Obviously not sprinting.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:46.520]   But what are some of the finer points
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.280]   on long distance endurance
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.280]   and how often should one do it?
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.040]   - Okay, frequency, you could do it daily, right?
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.720]   - Even when strength, doing strength and hypertrophy.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.560]   - No question.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560]   - Well, that I think is an important point
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.400]   for people to hear
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.400]   'cause a lot of people think that they are going
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.640]   to greatly diminish their strength and hypertrophy gains
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.640]   as it's often called by doing zone two cardio.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.160]   - Zone two, you have almost no ability
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.960]   to block your hypertrophy.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.160]   - Zone two, truly within that category,
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.560]   if you're talking about conversational pace,
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.760]   there is very, in fact, there's strong reason to think
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.120]   that is not going to influence hypertrophy
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.840]   for the overwhelming majority of people.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.720]   - It might even help it by increasing blood flow
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.120]   to the various muscles. - Absolutely.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.240]   - Does it matter, let's say someone's doing primarily
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.480]   strength and hypertrophy.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.360]   Their primary goals are strength and hypertrophy.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.960]   And then they're going to do,
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.000]   they're going to hit that 150 to 180 minutes
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.120]   of zone two cardio per week,
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.100]   assuming they're breaking that up
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:40.360]   into three or four sessions.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.440]   Does it matter if they do it in the same workout
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.520]   before or after, does that matter?
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.160]   I tend to do just by way of example for people,
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.560]   certainly I'm just one example.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:53.280]   I tend to do resistance training one day,
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.880]   then I'll do zone two cardio the next day.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.840]   I jog 'cause that's the thing I prefer.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.760]   Then I'll do strength hypertrophy training the next day
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.900]   and then jog for my zone two cardio.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:04.120]   And then I take one full day off a week.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:06.400]   I've never actually done the zone two cardio
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.560]   on the same day, but were I to do it on the same day?
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:10.920]   Would it matter if I did it before
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.040]   or after my strength hypertrophy training?
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:13.880]   - Not really.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.700]   - Okay.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.540]   - You're going to be just fine.
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.960]   Interference effects, the interference effect
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.320]   is what this is called.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.620]   So this is all the way back to 1980 Bob Hickman stuff, right?
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:25.880]   And he was actually working in a lab with John Halazzi,
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:29.240]   who's one of the fathers of exercise biochemistry.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:32.720]   And so the story goes that Hickman came in,
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.480]   he was a strength training guy and Halazzi,
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.480]   almost all those initial exercise physiologists
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.480]   were conditioning folks, right?
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.680]   So it's almost always swimmers and runners.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.360]   And that's why a bulk of the exercise physiology
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.920]   historically is shaped in that direction.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.700]   That's what those scientists were interested in.
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.140]   So Hickman was there in the lab
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.420]   and then the how much of this is myth or not,
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:55.400]   who really knows, but so the story goes.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.040]   That this is sort of chipping back and forth
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.320]   and you know how from a PI to a postdoc
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:02.240]   and kind of that razzing works a little bit.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.300]   And eventually he was like,
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:04.240]   you got to start running with us.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.780]   And he was like, you got to start lifting with me
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:06.980]   and kind of goes back and forth.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.620]   Well, you know who wins in that equation.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.980]   It's not the postdoc, right?
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:13.100]   So it's the PI gets in and Hickman says, okay, fine.
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.900]   So he starts running with Halazzi
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.180]   and then eventually starts to realize I'm getting weak.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.080]   I'm losing strength and I just can't,
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.500]   I think it was his bench press specifically
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.900]   was going down or maybe his squat.
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:22.740]   I can't remember.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.260]   Who knows if it's even real, but point is.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.140]   So he's going along and so eventually starts
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.180]   to create a little bit of animosity.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.680]   And it's like, actually I don't think it's good for me
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:32.520]   and then blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.460]   And so they did what any good scientists would do
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.960]   and said, well, let's find out, right?
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.940]   And so they, he run a really famous experiment
[01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:41.860]   where he took a group, three groups.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:44.460]   One group did a endurance piece, right?
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.480]   The steady state cardio.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:47.060]   One group did a strength training piece.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.940]   And then the third group did both of those workouts combined.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:50.920]   Not like a reduction.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.060]   So both volumes stacked on top of each other.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:56.460]   And the results are fairly predictable
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:59.380]   in terms of the endurance group only
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:02.080]   have the greatest increases in VO2 max and endurance markers.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:03.980]   The strength training group had the greatest increases
[01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:05.900]   in muscle hypertrophy.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.160]   But where the interesting part was
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.280]   and where this whole field started was the combined group.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.540]   So this is concurrent training
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.400]   is what it's generally called.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.820]   So you're doing concurrent things.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:16.440]   And typically that means hypertrophy and strength
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:18.600]   stacked on top of some steady state endurance.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.100]   - In the same time frame?
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.100]   - Same workout. - Same two hour block.
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.420]   - Or same like week.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:26.480]   It doesn't really, it can be kind of all these.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:31.260]   Well, the concurrent group saw the same improvements
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:34.180]   in VO2 max as the endurance group.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.080]   And he's like, well, okay.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.140]   So the strength training did not compromise
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:40.140]   the endurance adaptations.
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:43.460]   However, they saw much lower increases
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:44.980]   in strength and hypertrophy.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:49.180]   And so it was, the conclusion was the addition
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:52.740]   of endurance work compromised muscle growth
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.580]   and strength development.
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:55.500]   However, the addition of strength training
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.380]   to your endurance work will not compromise
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.060]   your endurance gains.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.620]   Now that second piece has been shown countless more times.
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:03.760]   So if you're an endurance athlete,
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.940]   adding strength training is almost always
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:08.640]   going to be massively beneficial.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.940]   Very little chance of detriment.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:12.100]   This is why every endurance athlete
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:14.380]   is gonna have some sort of strength and power component
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:15.620]   to their training.
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:18.020]   The controversy though came in the interference effect.
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.440]   So how much endurance training
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.580]   really blocks muscular development.
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:25.940]   And for years, myself included, was we preached hard.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.100]   Don't do these two things at the same time.
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.320]   My friend, my colleague, Kevin Murek,
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.740]   has a really nice review article.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:33.700]   Jimmy Bagley, those two guys put this thing out.
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:36.580]   You can go read that where they cover all these things
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:37.780]   and they've got some nice figures in there.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:41.940]   But the general answer here is interference effect
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:45.320]   is sort of real, but it's probably greatly overblown.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.180]   It matters.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:48.620]   So are you talking about a 20 minute jog
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.720]   at conversation pace?
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:53.300]   That's probably doing very little with the assumption
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.260]   that are you doing an eccentric based exercise like running?
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.980]   Well, then you're gonna have more of an interference effect
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.220]   than cycling.
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:02.460]   That makes a ton of sense if you think about it, right?
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.320]   What's your total energy intake?
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.940]   If you're eating sufficient calories,
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.420]   you can still be in an anabolic state.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.980]   If the addition of extra energy expenditure,
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:13.560]   that's all it really is, mark the cardio,
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.420]   put you in a negative energy state,
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.820]   it's gonna become very difficult to go through anabolism.
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.740]   So those things matter.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.420]   If you're talking about doing like running a few laps
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.540]   around the track as a warmup,
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:27.620]   like that's not interference effect.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:28.580]   What we're really talking about
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:31.540]   is a big volume performed consistently.
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:34.460]   Now, after Hickman came out with this paper in 1980,
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:38.300]   people followed it up in the '90s and 2000s with mechanism.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:40.100]   And we started to see,
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.300]   hey, there's this cell signaling pathway
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:44.780]   that goes down called mTOR,
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:47.100]   and that's what leads to muscle growth.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.540]   And then on the other side of that equation,
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:50.260]   there's a thing called AMPK,
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:51.940]   which is more associated with mitochondrial
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:54.340]   biogenesis and endurance.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.920]   And there's this little molecule in between
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.780]   at the time most people would point to TSC2.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.520]   Well, it turns out AMPK activation is fine.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:06.860]   If you activate mTOR, there's no bearing on AMPK,
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:09.040]   but if you activate AMPK,
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.780]   it's gonna activate TSC2, which inhibited mTOR.
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:14.220]   And so it was like, we had practical outcome,
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.780]   i.e. Hickman, you're gonna get weaker.
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.940]   Now we had mechanism.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.700]   So that story became very, very strong
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.180]   that this interference effect,
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.520]   and this is how science should work, right?
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.700]   When you see mechanism match up with practical human outcome,
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.800]   it's a strong thing. - That's what you want, yep.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.740]   - It was still wrong though.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.140]   It just took more science, right?
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.860]   And this is why we always have to give science
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.220]   a bit of time.
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:38.720]   And you have to be willing to follow, right?
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:41.540]   And again, even me in the field
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:43.660]   who has a practitioner background in science,
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.860]   I felt very strongly, this is a big problem.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:48.020]   It just didn't turn out to be the case.
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:49.840]   Enough studies came out where I'm like,
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.220]   okay, it's probably not that big a deal,
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:55.280]   unless the movement is heavily eccentric based,
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.280]   the volume is very high,
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.040]   you're trying to maximize muscle growth,
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.280]   and energy is not controlled.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.460]   If that's not all the case,
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:04.960]   interference effect is probably
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.460]   not something most people should worry about.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.660]   Especially when you compare that against
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.560]   the well-roundedness that you need
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.120]   for total physiological health.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.640]   Probably not a big deal.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.140]   - Very reassuring for me to hear,
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:21.660]   because I do enjoy lifting weights,
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:22.940]   and I really enjoy running,
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.480]   and I love running outside.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:26.820]   I believe I used to experience the interference effect
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.580]   when I used to do a very long run on Sundays.
[01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:32.900]   I would just go out for two hours or something like that.
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.340]   I don't know that I ate enough or who knows,
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.700]   I always feel like I eat enough or more.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:38.840]   I love to eat.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.100]   But that long Sunday run
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:44.540]   always made it hard for me to make progressive
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:49.260]   gains in strength and hypertrophy in the gym.
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:51.620]   Whereas when I cut that to 30 minutes,
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:53.500]   three or four times a week,
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.460]   I don't see any interference effect at all.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.300]   - Probably very real.
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:58.160]   - And I haven't trained specifically for endurance
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.000]   in a very long time,
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.660]   so I haven't experienced the non-interference effect,
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:03.740]   which as you said before,
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.740]   most, if not all, endurance athletes probably are,
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:08.700]   or at least should be doing some sort of strength work
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:10.740]   just to keep the undercarriage strong, as I think-
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:12.780]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of reasons, yeah.
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:16.940]   - So what are some protocols that people could explore
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.580]   for continuous endurance training?
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:21.980]   I mean, I've thrown out this 150 to 180 minute zone two
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:23.780]   cardio, but that's really the,
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:26.220]   that's really the kind of kindergarten of endurance.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:27.060]   - Yeah.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:28.140]   - And there, I'm probably being generous.
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:29.740]   It's probably the nursery school of endurance
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:30.960]   that everyone should do.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.620]   What sorts of other protocols?
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.420]   I realize that can be very goal-directed,
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.980]   but is it unreasonable, for instance,
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:39.360]   for somebody to do four hours
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.940]   of continuous endurance training with intervals in there
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:46.060]   as well to get it kind of all around heart health
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.940]   and the ability to go long distances?
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:50.060]   - Yeah, I'll answer this too, it's the very first one.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.700]   To tackle the long duration of endurance
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:54.620]   is how I refer to it.
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.380]   You asked really about heart rate zones.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.860]   To me, that's almost totally irrelevant.
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:51:59.860]   It doesn't matter, right?
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:00.900]   If you're moving, you're moving.
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:02.720]   That's the functional piece here.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:06.820]   If you want to push it and go at a non-conversational pace,
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.180]   that has tremendous health benefits.
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:11.700]   If you want to do it a little bit slower, fine.
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.580]   If you're at the pace where you can have a conversation,
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:15.740]   to me, I don't even count that as exercise.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:18.440]   That's not a pejorative, by the way.
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:20.100]   That is just general physical movement.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.860]   And it is extraordinarily clear, you need a lot of that.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:26.220]   You need a lot more of that than we get.
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:28.540]   You can do this in a couple of efficient ways,
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:30.880]   just taking your phone calls moving.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.920]   If you've got a 30-minute call every day
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:35.180]   or most days of the week, and you can do that while moving,
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:37.420]   you've checked not that whole box,
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:38.540]   but a pretty good chunk of it.
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:40.580]   - And that could even be done inside.
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:41.420]   - 100%. - It could be a pacing
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:42.240]   back and forth.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.700]   I'm a big pacer.
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:45.620]   Oh yeah, me too, like you probably saw me, like I'm going
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:47.660]   to walk up and down all over the place.
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.300]   Most of the time when I'm in my office working,
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:52.540]   like I'm shadowboxing, like I'm doing air squats,
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:54.100]   not even intentionally, I'm just like-
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.820]   - Do you have one of those treadmills under the desk?
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.380]   - I don't, but like every lab I ever came through,
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:52:59.220]   somebody did.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:01.380]   - We did an episode on workspace optimization,
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.580]   and the data on those treadmills are pretty interesting.
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:05.220]   They definitely increase alertness,
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.540]   which for obvious reasons, even a little bit of movement
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.180]   is going to generate a little bit of adrenaline.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.180]   So pacing around, moving, taking calls, moving,
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.940]   getting walks when you can,
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.960]   and then in terms of building endurance,
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:20.480]   let's say somebody wants to, quote unquote,
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:24.020]   get into better shape, they already,
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:26.040]   may or may not already have some size and strength
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.400]   that they're happy with, and they just want to get in,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.540]   they want to improve their health.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:30.380]   - Yep.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:33.180]   - So when does that 150, 180 minutes thing
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:34.900]   tick over into a different protocol?
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:36.980]   - Yeah, okay, so I think the way that I can outline
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:40.640]   a weekly schedule, just as a conceptual model here,
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:44.300]   that long duration stuff is not even counting,
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:45.140]   as I mentioned, right?
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:47.320]   It's just a, this is what you need to do as a human,
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.120]   moving forward, we haven't improved.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.020]   If you're extremely unfit, you may see some changes
[01:53:52.020 --> 01:53:53.640]   in cardiovascular health there, but for the most part,
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:55.960]   this is just knocking out the general physical practice
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.880]   you need to be higher functioning.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:00.540]   So whatever that time domain is, I don't really care.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.820]   It's not a huge concern of mine.
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:04.740]   What I think you need to hit are these nodes.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:06.500]   You need to do something once a week
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.740]   that gets you to a maximum heart rate.
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:11.760]   Now I don't have to literally mean max, but close.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.740]   - So this means really sucking for air.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:16.100]   - Really, like as high as you can possibly get.
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.140]   You can wear a heart rate monitor if you want,
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:20.500]   but maximum heart rate, the rough equation we say
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.460]   is 220 minus your age.
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:25.300]   So if you're 40 years old, your maximum heart rate
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.900]   is probably about 180 beats per minute.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.800]   Now I can tell you flat out right now,
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.580]   my max heart rate is close to 210,
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:36.180]   which means I'm 10 years old.
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:38.040]   So take that number with a grain of salt.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.240]   I have had a bunch of professional athletes
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.500]   who are in their 20s and their max heart rate is 175,
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.560]   and they are in way better shape than I am.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.260]   So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:48.820]   for physical fitness.
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:49.780]   It's a rough number.
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.940]   An easy way to do it is if you have a heart rate monitor
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:54.140]   or anything like that, do the hardest workout
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:57.020]   you can possibly do, see what the highest number you get as,
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.860]   and assume that's close.
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.580]   If you want to just start at 220 minus your age,
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:02.020]   that's fine too.
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:05.540]   Do something though where you're like, yep, this is death.
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:07.180]   Like this is really, really challenging.
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.380]   - For how long?
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.620]   - However long that takes you.
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:13.160]   That can be a 30 second go on an aerodyne or an aerosol bike.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.580]   That could be a,
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:20.300]   do one of those things where you kind of like sprint,
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:22.220]   run as hard as you can during the straightaway on a track
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:23.380]   and then walk the corners.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:25.440]   Kind of an old classic back when you and I
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.940]   were kids, interval training.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:27.940]   - They don't do that anymore?
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:28.780]   - I guess, I don't know.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:29.620]   I don't even have to talk about it.
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.380]   - In PE class, we had to change,
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:32.680]   and if you didn't bring running shoes,
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:33.700]   you had to do it barefoot.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:35.100]   - Oh, I love it.
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.140]   I love your teacher.
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.020]   - Yeah, it wasn't a,
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:40.780]   our football, basketball, baseball teams weren't that good,
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.060]   but anything like running cross country,
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:46.200]   just 'cause of where I grew up with brutal, brutal coaches.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.100]   So that, yeah, they'd make the, all kids do these runs.
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:53.520]   - Yep, so it can be in the 30 probably seconds at a minimum.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:56.140]   It's hard to get you to a true heart rate max
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.620]   in shorter than 30 seconds.
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:00.860]   You can get the total suck in under 20 seconds,
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:02.380]   but getting to a true heart rate max
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.100]   is probably gonna take more than 30 seconds.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:07.020]   So it doesn't really matter what you want to do.
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.660]   It can be, again, a sprint uphill.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:10.940]   It could be, well, you're talking,
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:12.740]   it could be burpees to death.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:14.220]   You know, like whatever you want to do, just-
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.700]   - Well, those have an eccentric component, right?
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:16.660]   - Yeah, they do. - Yeah.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:17.740]   - No question about it.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:19.840]   But if you did-
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.300]   - Not to actual death, by the way.
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.560]   - Yeah.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.400]   If you just did,
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:26.100]   I'm gonna do as many burpees as I can for 90 seconds.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.460]   It probably won't take you much longer than that
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:28.300]   to get to close to max heart rate.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.900]   - And is that the whole workout?
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:30.840]   - Could be.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.900]   - So once a week, get to max heart rate.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:33.740]   - Touch it.
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:34.560]   - I love it.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:35.400]   - Touch it.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.600]   It's not the best, but it'll work.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.880]   - And what are the specific benefits that that provides?
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.760]   - Okay, so earlier in our chat,
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.760]   we outlined the rule of specificity,
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:49.360]   specific adaptation to impose demand.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.720]   If you're never getting to that high of a pace,
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:54.020]   you're never, it would be like trying to get stronger,
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.920]   but only going to 60%.
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.360]   So every cardiovascular adaptation that occurs
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.320]   with cardiovascular training
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.720]   is just simply going to get to the topper end by doing this.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:03.800]   So if you just start at the heart itself,
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:05.040]   stroke volume increase.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:05.880]   This is the amount of blood
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.360]   that's kicked out per contraction.
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:11.440]   Cardiac output, resting heart rate.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.920]   If you go to the endothelial function,
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.740]   you're talking about nitric oxide release,
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:19.740]   endothelial health in general, capillary, mitochondria,
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.760]   all the way down, like you just walk through
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:24.360]   the whole system, pulmonary exchange to the lungs.
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.120]   All of those are going to benefit
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.160]   by being challenged to their maximum.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.920]   - They also teach you where your vomit reflex is.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:31.400]   - Yeah, there you go, right?
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:32.680]   - Let's hope not.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:34.200]   - Stress is what causes adaptation, right?
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.720]   So if you push your, okay, here's the difference.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.720]   If you did 25 minutes of steady state,
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.360]   you're not challenging the same thing
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.160]   as what we just talked about.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.120]   The way that I explain this is if you understand
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.360]   the point of physiological failure,
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.960]   then you understand the place of adaptation.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.000]   That's it.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.800]   So if you and I both go run on a,
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.560]   we both did a VO2 max test.
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.840]   So a classic VO2 max test is gonna take eight to 12 minutes.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.060]   And it's gonna look something like this.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:03.520]   We're gonna get in a treadmill and we're gonna run.
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:05.880]   And every minute, I'm gonna just slightly increase
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:07.720]   that treadmill, either the speed or the grade.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:09.360]   Most of the time, it's the speed, right?
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:12.480]   So we get to a high grade, say 10% grade or something.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.480]   And then we go five miles per hour, 5.2, 5.4.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:21.780]   And we just go until you can't go any longer.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.800]   Now let's say you and I did that
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.880]   and we had the same exact timeframe.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.860]   And so we both went eight minutes.
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:28.180]   The time that you last is not the thing
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:29.320]   that we care about, right?
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.800]   It's the volume of oxygen that you breathe out
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:33.060]   is what determines it.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:34.420]   But let's say we went with the same time domain
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:35.600]   and we had the same VO2 max.
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.200]   Let's say they were both 50 milliliters
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.800]   per kilogram per minute, which is like a okay number,
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.260]   but that's nothing to be extremely proud about.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:45.960]   Just because we have the same number
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:47.560]   does not mean we have the same point
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.040]   of physiological failure.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:50.680]   And this matters because it's gonna answer
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:53.480]   the what do I do about it then question, right?
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.960]   So if you got off and I started asking you
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:57.840]   a series of questions and you're like,
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.600]   I basically said, why'd you quit?
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.920]   You know, why did you jump off the treadmill?
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:01.760]   Why'd you stop?
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.760]   Like my chest, like I couldn't catch my breath.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:07.060]   I thought my heart was gonna explode.
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:08.380]   Okay, great.
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.200]   If you ask me and I said, my legs were on fire.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.200]   Like I was breathing hard, but I couldn't take another step.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:17.340]   This is a very rough indicator of different places
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:19.860]   of physiological disruption.
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:22.180]   Now, what I've seen a lot with my professional athletes,
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:25.860]   especially like fighters, they're going to generally fail
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:28.060]   in their legs because they don't often do a lot
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.020]   of strength training in their legs.
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.080]   They don't do a lot of leg work.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.820]   They're fighting on their back literally a lot
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.620]   or on top or on their knees.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:37.740]   So their legs tend to give out before, there.
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.740]   Someone who fails in the cardiovascular system,
[01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:41.800]   like say you did a lot of leg training,
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:43.720]   typically like an endurance athlete,
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:44.940]   that's not gonna be their issue.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:46.760]   It's just gonna be, they're gonna reach a heart rate
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:50.800]   and ventilation threshold that can no longer handle.
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:53.400]   If I put you on the exact same training protocols,
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:54.460]   it's not gonna be as effective
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:57.280]   because you're going to always fail at your legs
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.120]   and they're gonna always fail
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:00.480]   at their cardiovascular system.
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.440]   I need to flip that, right?
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:02.640]   You need to put you in a position
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:05.220]   to where you can reach a true heart rate
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:08.560]   or ventilation challenge while your legs
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:11.460]   are still hanging in there or the opposite.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:15.120]   So the training protocol is based on that point of failure.
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.820]   The adaptation is in the same thing.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:21.940]   So if you are failing because of your legs,
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.200]   then you might see a greater increase
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.040]   in capitalization in your legs.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.440]   Relative to somebody else who's failing
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.800]   in their cardiovascular system,
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:31.020]   they may see a greater change in something
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:31.960]   on that side of the equation.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.520]   So it matters how you're failing at all times.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.280]   - What I love about this is that it sounds like
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:41.120]   it's like a thermometer for where one is weak
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.280]   and needs work, but also provides a stimulus
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.560]   to improve the very thing that you need.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.040]   - That's the trick, right? - That you need support in.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:49.920]   So to just get real brass tacks about it,
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.420]   it would be once a week at 90 seconds
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:57.100]   near maximum heart rate, could I do more?
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:01:00.680]   Could I do five or six of those 90-second bouts?
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:01.520]   - No question.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:04.320]   You can do, as long as you touch that max heart rate,
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.320]   I'm good, right?
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.600]   Ideal world, probably four to eight.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.960]   - In that single session. - Ideal, right?
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.040]   If that takes you 20 seconds or 90 seconds, it's fine.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:15.340]   If you want to do 30 on, 30 off,
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:17.800]   you want to do 20 on, 40 off, 40 on, 20 off,
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:18.960]   those numbers don't matter.
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.780]   - And is there an interference effect of this
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.200]   on the other sorts of training that we've talked about?
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:25.300]   - It actually tends to be complimentary.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:27.900]   The evidence available suggests that this high interval stuff
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:31.300]   is more likely to be complimentary to hypertrophy training,
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.460]   probably because of lactate and some other cool things,
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.020]   which are very beneficial molecules
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:38.040]   that people don't understand.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:38.880]   They think it's bad.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.840]   It's actually a hugely beneficial thing.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:43.280]   It can be interference.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.460]   It can provide an interference
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:47.140]   if calories are not accounted for,
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.780]   if rest is not accounted for, and other things.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:51.160]   But in general, it's probably okay.
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:52.580]   I wouldn't add it to your equation
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:55.960]   if you don't need it for maximizing hypertrophy,
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:56.980]   but for the person who wants
[02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:59.020]   to just get well-rounded physiology,
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:00.720]   yeah, I wouldn't hesitate to do these
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.700]   even in the same session or different sessions.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.540]   - Terrific.
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.420]   So, and if that's done once a week
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:09.940]   and the 150 to 180 minutes or so of zone two cardio
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:12.820]   is done in the rest of the week,
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:14.020]   the person's doing their strength
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:15.980]   and hypertrophy training, we would hope,
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:19.140]   what other sorts of endurance practices
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:20.140]   could one incorporate?
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:21.480]   You mentioned muscular endurance,
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.820]   like the ability, would like a wall sit
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.120]   or the ability to do a plank.
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.580]   Was that, is that something, is that useful for anything?
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:28.420]   - Yes.
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:30.280]   - Except for doing planks and wall sitting?
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.180]   - No, no, it's extraordinarily useful.
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:34.880]   Let's hold on muscular endurance.
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:36.520]   I want to finish one more thing on this side.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:39.720]   So if we're building this week of endurance,
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.280]   once a week hit that number,
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.040]   if you can do repeated bouts,
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:47.000]   you know, we talked four to eight, that's fantastic.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.420]   If you can't muscle the,
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.660]   if you can't manage the mental energy every week,
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:55.560]   do it every other week.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:56.680]   It's still very good, right?
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.660]   'Cause I get it, like I'm a working person too.
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:00.420]   And sometimes you're just like, I cannot,
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:03.460]   like those workouts feel incredible afterwards,
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.100]   but man, they are daunting.
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:06.020]   If you love this stuff,
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:07.080]   you could do it four times a week.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.220]   If you hate it though,
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:09.260]   it's not realistic to think
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:10.980]   you're going to be able to knock this out.
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:13.100]   You're going to end up doing 70, 80%,
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.340]   which is not going to get you the benefits.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:15.460]   So just don't do it.
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:16.580]   - You really have to hit that ceiling.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:18.220]   - You got to get up there, close.
[02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:20.560]   - Have someone chase, I always say, you know the,
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.720]   when doing this kind of work in my mind,
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:26.480]   I'm thinking that I'm basically being chased
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.180]   by somebody with a syringe full of poison.
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.020]   - Yep.
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.140]   - And while there are other ways out of the situation
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:33.760]   and for the benefit of what we're talking about,
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.720]   what I'm referring to is to just run.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:36.600]   - Yep. - Yeah.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.140]   - My motivation is typically,
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.280]   if you just get this done,
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.080]   we're done in a couple of minutes.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.920]   Just get it done.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.680]   Like, don't go here if you're not going to do it.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.920]   When you show up, check in and it's over really quickly.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.740]   - Breathing down regulation afterwards.
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:52.100]   - 100%, you have to, right?
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:53.160]   It's a huge key.
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.080]   So if you absolutely can't do it, do it every other week.
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:56.080]   That's twice a month.
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.180]   Give me twice a month.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:03:59.920]   It can be done on the road, it can be done in 20 minutes.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.440]   Like do a really good, thorough warmup.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.380]   Don't just jump into those by the way, right away.
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:06.540]   It's not going to be as beneficial.
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:10.000]   Really nice, good sweat broke, a really good warmup,
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.500]   and then give me four minutes of hard work and we're done.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.120]   Right, get out of there.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.560]   If you want to use like a bath or hot thermal stress
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.340]   to kind of like aid in that warmup process, fine.
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:21.240]   Getting a sauna, getting a hot bath, get really hot,
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:22.960]   get up there, warm up, knock it out.
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:26.120]   Whole thing is 20 minutes plus five minutes breathing.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.320]   - I'm going to start doing this.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.400]   - It's so, you got a bike right there.
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.720]   - Yeah, I've got all sorts, every room in this studio
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.400]   that has a different piece of equipment it seems.
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.320]   - So I want that once a week,
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:37.840]   realistically every week if I have to.
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.500]   I want that physical activity piece,
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:41.860]   call it whatever you want, long duration thing.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:45.420]   Ideally, you'll do as much of that through your nose only.
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:46.560]   You're not going to be able to do the interval stuff
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:49.120]   at nose only, don't even try.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.240]   But if you can go that whole 30 minute time
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.920]   or 20 or 40 minutes, whatever it's going to be,
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.740]   that's actually a good way to regulate intensity.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:57.280]   So go as hard as you can while still being able
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:58.360]   to breathe through your nose only.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:01.580]   If you have to open up your mouth a little bit, fine,
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:02.720]   but try to stay there.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:04.420]   What you'll see is very quickly,
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:06.280]   you'll be able to increase your work output
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.120]   while just breathing through your nose,
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.740]   which has a bunch of other benefits.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:14.340]   The other piece I want is this middle ground,
[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:19.280]   which is can you sustain hard work for eight to 12,
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:20.480]   maybe as little as four minutes?
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:22.120]   I'll give you four to 12 minutes.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.440]   This doesn't have to be quite as high as the first one.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.640]   You don't have to get to a heart rate max,
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.800]   but can you get somewhere in the 80% range?
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.980]   And can you hold that for four minutes?
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:36.240]   Maybe give me two minutes, two minutes of rest
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.800]   and do that twice, something like that.
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:40.860]   Ideal situation is what a runner would do
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:43.440]   is like what we'll call mile repeats,
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.960]   'cause they're running four or five minute miles.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.800]   Whatever time it takes them to finish,
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:48.640]   they're gonna rest that.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.220]   So it's a one to one work to rest ratio.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:54.340]   So a five minute mile rest five minutes can go again.
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.760]   That's probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:59.500]   - Well, the five minute part is unrealistic for most folks.
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:02.260]   For me, it would be eight minutes, eight minutes.
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:03.100]   - Fine.
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:03.920]   - Probably something like that.
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:06.940]   - Well, in your particular case, just do the 800 meter.
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:08.520]   So do 800 meters.
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:11.080]   Do something that takes two to six minutes to work.
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:14.800]   It is a lower intensity than the max stuff,
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:17.500]   but is a much higher workload.
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:19.260]   That is probably gonna give you,
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:22.120]   you might even argue the most cardiovascular benefit
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:24.560]   because it is sustained work output.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:25.440]   And that's very critical.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:28.960]   The downside of kind of like that conversational pace,
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:31.480]   it's physical activity, it's movement,
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:33.200]   it's blood flow, it's lymphatic drainage.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.660]   It's not very cardiovascularly challenging though.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.720]   You're just not gonna get an optimal health
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:41.560]   from just walking actively.
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:44.640]   - So two to six minutes of hard work
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:47.040]   with then an equivalent amount of rest in between
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.600]   and then repeat how many times?
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:51.600]   - Once if you have to.
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:52.520]   If it needs to be one rep,
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.720]   if it needs to be a six minute thing
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.600]   and then downregulate breathe.
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:57.600]   Twice if you can do that, six times, eight times,
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.560]   like whatever you can really do.
[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:01.960]   And you can just take that as long of the training session
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.000]   as you want or short.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.320]   Exercise choice can be whatever you want.
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.660]   So again, you can do sled pushes
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:12.420]   or it could be a kettlebell circuit or any combination
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.740]   of things where you're just, you're working
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:15.480]   and you're not giving yourself a break.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.980]   You have got to be able to hold on
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:20.700]   at a very high waste product production level
[02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.320]   as well as a high demand for energy.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:26.340]   And then bring it down.
[02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:28.580]   - And breathing during this two to six minutes
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:32.880]   of hard output is mainly through the nose
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.120]   or combination nose and mouth,
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.380]   or is that getting too technical?
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:37.020]   - Well, it's probably like I like it,
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:39.120]   but you tell me if it's too technical.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.520]   You're going to try to maintain nasal only
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:43.020]   as much as you can, but you're going to lose it at some point.
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:47.960]   You can go through Brian and Rob's gear system
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.580]   and learn more and then you can kind of see
[02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:50.420]   what gear to be in.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:52.140]   If you have to go nose in, mouth out
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:53.980]   or something like that.
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:56.380]   But I don't really care too much honestly, in that range.
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:08:00.220]   I'm getting most of my nasal only stuff at night
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:01.620]   and training and everything.
[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.800]   So if you have to open up the throttle there
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.500]   to get the work done, that's okay.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:09.380]   Oh, then we'll actually answer your question,
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:11.020]   which is muscular endurance.
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:13.180]   Let's go back to that piece.
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:14.760]   Muscular endurance is incredibly important
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:17.060]   for general maintenance of joint health.
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:22.060]   In other words, you have got form follows function, right?
[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:25.100]   It's a very classic science-y physiology saying,
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:27.820]   meaning you've got a couple of different, there's a bunch,
[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:30.620]   but to make it easy, two different types of muscle fibers,
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:32.300]   fast twitch and slow twitch.
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:35.760]   Fast twitch fibers tend to be, but they're not always bigger.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:37.260]   They contract with a higher velocity.
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:39.140]   That's why they are called fast twitch,
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:42.900]   but they tend to be more glycolytic and thus fatigable.
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:45.340]   Slow twitch tend to be smaller.
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:46.300]   Well, not always.
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:49.100]   They are more packed with mitochondria
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:51.060]   that we're generally better at burning fat as fuel,
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.860]   but contract with lower velocity.
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:55.020]   Well, we have these two types
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:57.480]   so that we can regulate function more.
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:00.180]   You have some muscle groups that we're going to,
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:02.800]   sorry, let me go back up a quick second.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.360]   Each individual muscle in a human body has a combination
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.960]   of some amount of fast and some amount of slow.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:09.540]   That percentage of fast versus slow
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:11.400]   differs from muscle to muscle.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.500]   So it also differs from person to person.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.940]   Easy example is your calf muscle.
[02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:19.300]   There's three, but there's two primary muscles in your calf.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.580]   One's called the soleus and one's the gastroc.
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:23.980]   The gastroc is the one where if you take your toe
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:26.300]   and point it towards your face and then flex,
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:30.480]   that's the one that pops out on the medial side, the inside.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.100]   The soleus is what we call an anti-gravity muscle.
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:38.060]   And it is generally about 80% to even 90% slow twitch.
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:41.260]   And that's because it's supposed to be contracted lightly,
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:43.600]   all time, it's supposed to be on permanently.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.500]   It's meant to keep, we call it anti-gravity
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:48.500]   'cause it's meant to keep you erect, up and moving.
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.300]   Your spinal erector is supposed to do this,
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.720]   various muscles for postural
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.420]   are generally slow twitch muscles.
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:55.860]   So we're supposed to be on all times,
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:10:00.700]   not produce fast, not produce force, but don't get tired.
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:02.700]   The gastroc is the opposite.
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:05.020]   It's not activated very often, but when it's activated,
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.020]   it's meant for extreme propulsion.
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:08.440]   So this gives us the ability to reach up
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:11.500]   and scratch our eyeball and also punch somebody, right?
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.300]   We have to be able to regulate force output,
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.420]   which is going back to Henneman, right?
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.120]   Controlling what we use and what we don't use
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:18.880]   while also not wasting energy,
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.580]   which is the downside of activating
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:24.140]   a big threshold motor neuron is it requires a ton of energy.
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:26.380]   It's a more efficient mode of energy,
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:28.660]   but the total amount is really, really high.
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:33.420]   So muscular endurance is going to help
[02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:35.720]   those slow twitch muscle fibers
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.940]   and slow twitch predominant muscles
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:40.820]   maintain their working job.
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.820]   So if you lose your muscular endurance ability
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:44.220]   in your spinal erectors or your calf,
[02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:46.340]   you're gonna start slumping into bad positions.
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:50.000]   You're gonna be putting joints in a movement pattern
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.500]   that they're not going to be the most happy with.
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.200]   So it's more about than being able
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.540]   to just maintain a two minute wall squat.
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:58.580]   It's about maintaining joint integrity.
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:01.380]   And allowing that musculature to not fatigue
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:04.380]   when you ask it to do heavy and fast.
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:06.940]   So what I mean by that is you've got a whole combination
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:09.300]   of muscles in your shoulder.
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:10.260]   And we will generally call these
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:11.780]   like the rotator cuff muscles.
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:15.900]   Well, let's imagine those slow twitch postural muscles
[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:21.700]   get fatigued and they start to lose contractile tension.
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:23.900]   And then you go to do something heavy or fast
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:25.380]   or an emergency situation.
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:27.220]   Those are already pre-fatigued.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:29.260]   You're gonna rely more upon the fast twitch muscle fibers
[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:32.060]   which are there less for postural integrity.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:33.820]   You're likely to get out of position.
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:35.500]   And this is a whole recipe of like,
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:37.760]   God, why is my shoulder just hurting?
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:39.460]   God, my back.
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:42.040]   That's very often a case of the slow twitch fibers
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:43.840]   and the slow twitch muscle groups
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.100]   losing muscular endurance.
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:46.460]   So you need to build that back up
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:49.640]   so that they can control and hold the joint in the position
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:52.340]   so the fast twitch fibers can then contract with force.
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:55.860]   - I'm hoping that what I'm gonna say next
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:58.980]   meets what you said accurately.
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:02.840]   My experience is that getting injured, lifting weights,
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.980]   or even doing housework or yard work
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:08.960]   almost always happens when I'm not paying attention,
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:11.140]   fatigued, that's kind of obvious,
[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:15.420]   but also getting in position to initiate a movement,
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:18.380]   setting down a weight or lifting weights off the rack
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:19.640]   or picking up dumbbells.
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:23.040]   That's almost always when I seem to activate
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.100]   this lower back thing that happens every, you know,
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:26.740]   six or eight months.
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:28.940]   And what you're saying, if I understand correctly,
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:31.740]   is that this muscular endurance from wall sits or planks
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:32.580]   or things of that sort,
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:35.600]   maybe you could give us a few other examples of these,
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.620]   can help us because they actually prepare the system
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:41.900]   to do what we normally think of as the more intense work.
[02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:43.140]   So it's really the,
[02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:46.900]   it sounds like it's really the architecture of the body
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:47.980]   that includes the nerves and muscles
[02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:49.260]   and everything else, of course,
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:53.180]   that lets the limbs and other kind of action end
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:54.980]   of the body do its best work.
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:57.540]   - Yeah, let it express its own power and force.
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:01.280]   Yep, we've actually landed on one of my final laws
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.720]   of strength and conditioning,
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.140]   which is similar to what I said earlier, right?
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:08.160]   So I said, exercises do not determine adaptations.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:10.660]   Application determines adaptation.
[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:12.720]   So it sounds similar, but it's quite different.
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:15.100]   There are no good or bad exercises.
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:17.780]   There's only good or bad application.
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:20.420]   Here's a great example of that, right?
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:23.740]   So you do not get hurt deadlifting
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.460]   because deadlifts are dangerous.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.860]   You only get hurt deadlifting
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:30.240]   because you either got in bad position,
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.280]   you got in bad position
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:33.020]   because you either started in bad position,
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.100]   which is one of the things you just said,
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:36.780]   or you ended up in bad position.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:41.520]   You did too much volume, you did too much intensity,
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:43.060]   or you did too much complexity.
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.420]   Those last three things all hurt you
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:47.400]   because they result in the first one,
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.340]   which is out of position.
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:50.700]   Or another way to think about this
[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:53.500]   is if it's not a visible change in position
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:58.120]   is stress got put into a part of the system
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:00.040]   that should not absorb that much stress.
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:02.980]   So you did too much of it, you did it too heavy,
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:05.620]   you got fatigued, and so you broke position.
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:07.420]   You got too heavy, so you broke position.
[02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:09.300]   You made the exercise too complex,
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.800]   you put too many moving parts in it,
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:13.720]   you put too many joints in it, and you got out of position.
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:15.420]   You did that too many times.
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.780]   Over time, now we've led for either an acute injury,
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:21.260]   bam, you know, back pops and you fall on the floor,
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:24.460]   it is like, man, this thing is hurting over time.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:25.900]   All these result in the same thing.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.100]   So you cannot ever blame the exercise
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.300]   for causing the problem.
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:32.500]   It's always either the user or the coach.
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:34.120]   You programmed way too much here
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:35.700]   and I can't handle that position
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.820]   or you yourself went into it too much.
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:40.060]   So if you're getting these little tweaks
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.280]   and problems going on,
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.180]   you've made an error in one of those things.
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:45.420]   So simply back off.
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:47.940]   Reduce the complexity, right?
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:50.480]   Give yourself more stability, less moving parts.
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.040]   Do less volume, do less intensity.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:54.380]   In fact, if you look at the people
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:55.780]   from the physical therapy world
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.900]   in terms of the pain literature,
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.560]   it's very clear that just stopping a movement
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.180]   is very rarely going to work.
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:04.500]   What you wanna do is back off all the way down
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:07.680]   to just below that threshold of that's what aggravates it.
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:09.620]   And you wanna train right there.
[02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:11.140]   That's gonna allow you to do two things.
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:12.660]   Number one, tissue tolerance,
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.860]   and then number two, desensitization.
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:15.880]   A lot of pain stuff,
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:18.540]   and you can probably speak a lot about this,
[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:19.940]   especially with things like low back pain,
[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:23.320]   is there's not necessarily often much damage there.
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:25.620]   It's a lot of hypersensitization
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:27.380]   of just pain signal, pain signal.
[02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:30.040]   Omitting the movement entirely
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:31.340]   does not get that signal to go away.
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:34.980]   You need to train just below that signal and desensitize it.
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:37.000]   So you wanna make sure that the muscular endurance
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.380]   allows you, you're just putting volume
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:41.740]   right below where you start to get a tweak.
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:44.140]   And it is beautifully effective for that.
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:46.540]   - I've experienced this right side lower back pain
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:48.100]   for years, sometimes shooting down the hip.
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:50.300]   The two things that really helped
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:52.700]   were doing anterior tib work.
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:56.560]   So hats off to knees over toes guy, Ben Patrick,
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:01.220]   who has created a lot of popularity around tib work.
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:04.660]   - Turns out joints, full range of motion,
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:05.540]   you're in a better spot.
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:07.460]   - Yeah, something about stabilizing
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:09.460]   the stuff from the knee down helped my back.
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:11.180]   And then also some neck work.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.640]   And friends of mine are always teasing me
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:15.020]   that my gym is filled with the most bizarre equipment.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.260]   It doesn't look like any other gym.
[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:18.060]   A lot of it is just designed to keep me healthy
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:19.040]   and still training.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:23.020]   But I love this idea of getting right below
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:24.740]   the threshold of pain activation
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:28.300]   and not simply going into complete non-action
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.540]   or just taking complete rest
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:32.100]   'cause that actually can be detrimental.
[02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:34.500]   I'd love to talk about a few items
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:36.620]   that support training of all kinds
[02:16:36.620 --> 02:16:38.500]   and where there's a lot of confusion
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:41.460]   and indeed misconception and mystery.
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:42.940]   And just get your take on these.
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:45.220]   And I just wanna acknowledge at the outset
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.900]   that for some of these, there's a lot of science.
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:49.020]   For some of them, there's less science,
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:53.500]   but there certainly is a lot of experience in your camp.
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:57.780]   And those categories are cold, heat, and hydration.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:16:59.740]   Because obviously whether or not you're a runner,
[02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:01.860]   whether or not you're strength training,
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:05.260]   if you're a human being, you need to hydrate.
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:09.540]   But in terms of work output and physical work output,
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:10.940]   maybe even cognitive work output,
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:13.300]   maybe tackle hydration first.
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:16.080]   There is what I call and what I think is now
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:18.680]   come to be known as the Galpin equation,
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:21.200]   which you really do deserve credit for
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:23.800]   because I think that people realize
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:26.140]   that there are a range of solutions out there,
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:30.320]   but there is a desperate need for straightforward solutions
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:33.160]   that work for 75% of people 75% of the time.
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.580]   So hydration is key.
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:39.060]   Maybe you could underscore just how key it is for us.
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:42.320]   And then what is the Galpin equation as I call it?
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.100]   And I think others are now referring to it.
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.580]   - Yeah, okay.
[02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:50.940]   Benefits of hydration/consequences of mishydration.
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:53.140]   So whether it's dehydration or overload.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:57.900]   Physiology has hermetic curves, right?
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:00.280]   Now typically we think about this in terms of toxicology.
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.380]   So what this means is at some point
[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:05.140]   giving you a dose of something,
[02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:06.640]   testosterone is a very easy example.
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:09.700]   If you're clinically deficient or low in testosterone
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:10.920]   and I gave you a little bit
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.860]   and it brings you back into a normal range,
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:14.620]   you generally see an improvement
[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:16.200]   in health and functionality.
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.720]   Taking you though from normal to super high
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:22.360]   doesn't always necessarily provide additional benefit.
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:23.440]   In fact, if you continue to go,
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:24.680]   it's gonna provide detriment, right?
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:26.440]   So everything has this curve.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.000]   And then some things are hermetic stressors,
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.360]   which means like a small, short, fast insult
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:32.200]   is actually beneficial
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:35.020]   because then you come back bigger, faster, stronger.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:36.800]   That's how adaptation works.
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:38.380]   Basic hormesis, okay?
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:39.440]   Hydration is the same way.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.700]   So at the end of the curve here,
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.800]   if you are under hydrated, we all know you could die, right?
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:46.120]   You have to have things.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:49.000]   In fact, water is the only thing
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.360]   that is ubiquitous across biologies
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:53.600]   in terms of every living thing has to have it.
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.360]   There's no other vitamin, mineral, nutrient
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:56.720]   that is required among all living things
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:58.200]   with the exception of water.
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:18:59.860]   So that should give you a pretty good indication
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:02.020]   of it's importante, right?
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:04.340]   Like you gotta have this thing.
[02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:06.760]   Down here at the bottom, if you're dehydrated
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:08.520]   and I give you more, it's beneficial effects.
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:10.280]   However, if you're up the top already
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.680]   and I continue to give you more water past that,
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.280]   now we run into actual problems
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:16.540]   and we can get what's called hyponatremia,
[02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:19.300]   which is more common than people realize.
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:22.120]   Natremia being, actually not referring to the water,
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:25.080]   but the sodium concentration being too low.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.180]   And you've probably talked about that
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:28.580]   at length of why that's an issue.
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:30.800]   If sodium potassium balances inside,
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:33.380]   outside of cell come off, your heart stops, right?
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:36.700]   Muscle contraction ends and all these things.
[02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:39.140]   So you don't wanna be over or under hydrated.
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:41.320]   So understanding this rough equation
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:45.460]   I sort of loosely calculated one day is helpful for that.
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:47.720]   I think the most context is talking about
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:49.600]   how much water to drink throughout the day
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:51.380]   and then how much water to drink during exercise.
[02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:54.300]   So the very easy answer is half your body weight
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:57.960]   in ounces per day is a very loose guideline
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:59.480]   for total amount of fluid consumption.
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:02.880]   So if you weigh 200 pounds, aim for 100 ounces of water.
[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:05.120]   It's like a very easy number.
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:08.000]   If you hit that, you're probably, I'd say 90% of you
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.240]   are a good 90% of the time alone.
[02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:12.800]   If you then go to exercise, you need to then account
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:14.640]   for that fluid loss with exercise.
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:19.640]   And in general, you wanna consume 125% to 150%
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:23.520]   of the amount of weight you lost in fluid.
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:25.640]   In other words, if you worked out
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:28.160]   and you were 200 pounds naked and you went
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:29.720]   and did your workout and then you dried off
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.660]   and you weighed yourself again and now you're 198 pounds,
[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:35.480]   you lost two pounds of water, that's 32 ounces.
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:39.020]   You wanna drink back about 125% of that.
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:40.840]   So instead of drinking 32 ounces,
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:45.480]   I want you to drink 40, 42, 45, like something like this.
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.780]   'Cause one of the reasons why is unless you're drinking
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:50.240]   something that is isotonic, meaning the same exact
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:53.560]   concentration in your blood and that you're in your fluid,
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:55.920]   you're just gonna go closer to that hyponatremia.
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:58.640]   You're gonna get a bunch of baroreflector responses
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:01.120]   and you're going to actually think you have too much fluid
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:02.520]   and you're gonna urinate it out.
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:05.520]   - What if I'm not weighing myself before and after workouts?
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:10.520]   And is there a shorthand version of this that, you know,
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:12.920]   after training for an hour,
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:15.480]   I should drink at least X number of ounces?
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:18.640]   Assuming it's at kind of taller, you know,
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:20.360]   I'm not sweating super heavily.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:22.780]   - Yeah, in that particular case,
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:26.320]   you could probably go something like,
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:30.720]   if everyone in the world did, I don't know,
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:35.040]   12 to 20 ounces, that's probably pretty decent.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.400]   - And they're probably doing that, right?
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:39.880]   And what about electrolytes consuming salt, potassium,
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:40.720]   and many things?
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:43.720]   - But that thing only works though if you're coming in
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:45.200]   at optimal hydration.
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.040]   And this is the problem.
[02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:49.240]   This is why you have to flag this starting with
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:51.400]   a good total daily amount of water.
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:52.880]   Because if you're coming in and you're like,
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:55.380]   "Oh, I drink two or three glasses of water a day,"
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:57.880]   then you might need to drink 50 or 60 ounces post-workout
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:21:59.560]   'cause you're way behind.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.820]   So that like, oh, 12 ounces or so works
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:03.720]   if you're already generally very well hydrated.
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:05.600]   - And if people are drinking, you know,
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.000]   four to six glasses of water a day,
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.380]   but they're also drinking a lot of caffeine in any form,
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:12.320]   then they're going to be excreting more water
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.280]   in most cases, right?
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:16.160]   Because caffeine's a diuretic.
[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:18.200]   - Okay, it kind of is, but it kind of isn't either.
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:21.000]   It's not the diuretic that we used to think about it as.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.080]   It is still fluid consumption.
[02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:25.200]   So it's only a diuretic if it causes you to excrete
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:27.840]   more fluid than it actually was being in.
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:32.840]   So if caffeine intake is in a normal range,
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:36.560]   I don't have to worry about the diuretic effects.
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:39.260]   If someone is drinking 12 cups of coffee a day,
[02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:42.160]   or they're taking caffeine pills or something,
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:45.980]   now the excretion is going to out-kick the coverage.
[02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:47.040]   So now we're gonna have problems, right?
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:49.360]   'Cause there's no fluid consumption with the caffeine pill.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:52.020]   So in general, things like tea consumption,
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:53.760]   like I'm not super worried about those things.
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:55.800]   You can count those towards your total fluid intake
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:56.700]   if you want.
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:58.760]   So if you're like, I drink 60 ounces of water
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:00.900]   plus 20 ounces of coffee,
[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.400]   and then you're gonna add that all up
[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:05.460]   and you're gonna be totally okay.
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:09.020]   So you also have problems with synthetic forms of caffeine
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:11.520]   versus natural forms of caffeine.
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:14.120]   Natural forms are pretty okay.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:15.400]   - So coffee, tea, et cetera.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:16.240]   - Yeah, all that stuff.
[02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:17.680]   - Pill form is where it gets tricky.
[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:19.540]   - Always, like always, right?
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:24.320]   So general, just eat real food and things.
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:25.160]   You're gonna be just fine.
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:27.860]   The last piece to consider is your diet quality matters
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:33.780]   because the fluid content in your food can vary wildly.
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:39.460]   So something like a bagel might be 5% to 10% water
[02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:44.960]   or something like a watermelon is 98%, 95%,
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:46.160]   something in a huge range.
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:49.260]   Even meat is very high percentage of fluid intake.
[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:50.140]   Like it's really high.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:50.980]   Even after you cook it,
[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:52.620]   there's still a lot of fluid in there.
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:55.880]   So if you're eating a whole food,
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.560]   mostly whole food based diet,
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:00.580]   your endogenous hydration is actually pretty high already
[02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:01.420]   just from your food.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:03.260]   If you're eating a very highly processed,
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:06.420]   dehydrated, oversalted diet,
[02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:09.380]   you're way low on hydration just in your food.
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.780]   So you have to factor all these things in.
[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:13.780]   In fact, one of the things that happens to us constantly
[02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:16.620]   with folks that go from a highly processed,
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:19.060]   low quality diet to a high quality one
[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:20.900]   is they're just peeing nonstop.
[02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:21.740]   I'm like, "What the hell is going on?"
[02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:23.660]   I'm like, "Well, you actually have brought in
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:26.180]   60 additional ounces of water in your diet
[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:27.580]   relative to what you used to have.
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:32.580]   And you've gone from 10 grams of sodium there to four,
[02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:33.840]   to two, sometimes one.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.820]   Sometimes it gets very low 'cause you're not like salt.
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:36.680]   Are you salting your food?
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:37.520]   No.
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.660]   Okay, well, we don't have sodium intake then.
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.060]   Like we're way down.
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:43.920]   So everything that we're considering is based on that.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:46.540]   So let's assume someone's eating a pretty well balanced diet.
[02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:48.980]   They're drinking 60 ounces of water
[02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:52.400]   and maybe some caffeine, coffee and tea, things like that.
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:56.220]   We don't exactly know the optimal amount
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.580]   of sodium one should intake.
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:00.080]   It is very clear high sodium concentrations
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:02.600]   are still associated with a lot of negative health outcomes,
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:05.900]   especially in combination with poor physical activity,
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:07.860]   in combination with low food quality
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:09.540]   and other comorbidities.
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:10.660]   That's a very bad thing.
[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:14.160]   You need to be very careful about those things.
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:16.300]   If everything else is okay,
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:18.200]   we're okay playing with a little bit of higher salt.
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:19.960]   In fact, you're probably gonna feel better.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.460]   You're gonna feel generally pretty good.
[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:24.700]   You just, it needs to be very clear.
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:27.300]   If you are overweight, highly stressed,
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:28.740]   and you don't have a lot of these things ticked off
[02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:30.200]   and you have known comorbidities,
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:32.340]   you really need to pay attention to salt intake.
[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:33.540]   It can be very nasty.
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:36.220]   So that being said,
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:38.000]   what we're generally going to look at, folks,
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.620]   is are you at least, can we categorize you
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:43.340]   as a low sodium or high sodium sweater?
[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:46.540]   If so, there's a whole list of electrolytes you can look on
[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:48.580]   that are gonna have something like
[02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:51.620]   200 to 400 milligrams per serving.
[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:53.820]   And there's a whole list of these things.
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:54.980]   If you're a low sodium sweater,
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:56.740]   I'm probably gonna send you after one of those.
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:58.180]   If you're a high sodium sweater,
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:25:59.500]   there's a lot of electrolyte supplements
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:01.280]   that are closer to six or 800,
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:05.460]   even a whole gram per single serving size.
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:06.780]   So you want to play with that.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:08.140]   - How do you know if you're a low sodium
[02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:09.480]   or high sodium sweater?
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:12.740]   We actually have an episode on salt we put out that,
[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.800]   or is coming out soon if hasn't come out already,
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:20.720]   which is when you look at the hazard ratios for salt intake,
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:23.360]   basically your probability of really bad things
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.000]   happen to you, goes way up as you get towards
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000]   a lot of sodium intake, 10, 12 grams per day.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000]   And this is translated to teaspoons of salt, et cetera,
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]   but also very low sodium intake is a problem.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.200]   - No question about it.
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:37.700]   - It's not a perfect U shape.
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:39.460]   It's kind of a J shaped curve
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:41.740]   or a kind of hockey stick shape more or less.
[02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:44.800]   But how would I know if I'm a low sodium
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:46.140]   or high sodium sweater?
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.760]   Would I just kind of lick my sweat
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:48.600]   or have someone else do it?
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:49.800]   - You can.
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:52.540]   Find a super friend who will lick your sweat for you.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:53.520]   Same with how-
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:55.080]   - No willing volunteers that I'm aware of,
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:56.760]   but would I be able to tell?
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:57.800]   - Yeah.
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:26:58.960]   You can get sweat testing done.
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.260]   Actually, you have a number of options.
[02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:04.200]   The kind of the original one that most of us used
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.300]   in the background for many years was called Levelin.
[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:08.480]   They'll send you out a little patch.
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:10.040]   You can wear that, send it in the lab
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:12.100]   and they'll measure it directly in the lab and send it back.
[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:14.940]   It's 150 bucks or something like that.
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:17.420]   - Do they bin you into low, medium and high sodium?
[02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:18.420]   - They're going to do that,
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:21.500]   but they're going to tell you exactly the milligrams.
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:22.620]   And then they're going to actually tell you
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:25.880]   what products and stuff that are exactly matched.
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:27.740]   - Do you do this with professional athletes?
[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:28.940]   - We have many times.
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:30.200]   - Interesting.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:31.940]   - You can do a more consumer grade version.
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:33.980]   Gatorade has a patch.
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:36.220]   For 25 bucks, you can get two of them.
[02:27:36.220 --> 02:27:38.840]   You can put that patch on your left forearm
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:40.960]   and download the Gatorade app and you can do a workout,
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:42.520]   measure it right there and click it over.
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:45.280]   And they'll tell you exactly, not only high or low,
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:47.340]   but again, they'll tell you the milligrams of sodium
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:48.180]   that are in your sweat.
[02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:49.840]   And then you can figure out again,
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:51.880]   kind of high, medium or low.
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:55.460]   - I do much better on a slightly higher sodium intake.
[02:27:55.460 --> 02:27:56.440]   - Most do.
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:58.960]   - But in my carbohydrate, I do eat carbohydrates.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.700]   I'm one of those that is pretty moderate,
[02:28:00.700 --> 02:28:01.800]   but I try and eat clean foods.
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:05.400]   So I noticed, and I tend to be slightly low blood pressure.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:07.680]   So again, to reiterate the warning there
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:09.760]   that if somebody is a pre-hypertension
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:11.080]   or has hypertension or obese,
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:13.600]   you really do need to be careful with your sodium intake.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:16.160]   But many people seem to find that they feel better
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:17.440]   when they increase their sodium intake.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.980]   And they're still in that healthy portion
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:20.620]   of the hazard ratio curve.
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:23.280]   - Most of the athletes, I would say in general,
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:24.840]   we're going to go higher in salt.
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:25.840]   When they come, we're going to run their stuff
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:27.040]   and we're going to add salt.
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:29.560]   Almost always, very few times have I gone,
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:31.160]   ah, we need to cut this back.
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:32.480]   One of the exception of the ones that come in
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:34.540]   that eat like 14 year olds.
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:36.920]   And I'm like, okay, you're at 15 milligrams,
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:38.120]   are you 15 grams a day?
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:40.040]   Because you're eating nothing but-
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:40.920]   - Garbage.
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:42.240]   - So we're like, we're going to come down,
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.440]   you're going to feel way better.
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.860]   All this bloating and everything else
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:46.860]   that's going to happen, go down.
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:47.700]   You can do that.
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:49.900]   There are biosensors that are coming out
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:50.900]   that are not available yet,
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:52.540]   but they're coming very soon in this space.
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:56.400]   They're going to give you real time metrics on salt.
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:59.120]   So you can pay attention to those.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.880]   I haven't seen one and used one personally,
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.960]   so I don't want to espouse about how good or bad it is.
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:06.200]   But I know that those are coming
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:08.480]   from a handful of companies.
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:10.680]   An easy way to do is just look at,
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:13.060]   wear a hat or wear some sort of headband or something
[02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:14.320]   and do your workout.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:15.160]   Take it off.
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:18.440]   If you see a just huge white band
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:20.720]   or if it's completely clear,
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:22.320]   and that's going to tell you big white band,
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:24.160]   you're probably a high salt sweater.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:26.700]   Completely clear, very little coming out.
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:27.540]   - That's great.
[02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:29.500]   And I can see the posts on Instagram now,
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:33.360]   people showing their salt band from sweating.
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:35.340]   I mean, obviously salt is so essential
[02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:37.160]   for so many physiological functions.
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.240]   You don't want too high or too low,
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.420]   but if you're losing more, it makes sense.
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:40.960]   You would need to take in more.
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:43.560]   So half of my body weight in ounces
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.560]   as a just foundation of fluid intake.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:49.120]   Coffee and tea could be included in that,
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:50.760]   but that should probably be mostly water
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:51.960]   or things similar to it.
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:56.500]   And then during exercise,
[02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:59.040]   how do I want to think about this again?
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.280]   Let's say I'm a high salt output,
[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:04.280]   then I'd want to drink maybe 40 ounces of water with,
[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:05.260]   or more.
[02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:07.460]   - Yeah, okay, I'll do this easier.
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:10.340]   Let's talk about pre and mid and post, right?
[02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:11.720]   So what to drink pre.
[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:14.800]   If you come in having hit these rules, you're okay.
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:18.840]   And pre workout can be as little as like five or six ounces,
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:21.800]   basically a couple of sips of water, fine.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:23.880]   If you come in poorly hydrated,
[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.020]   then you maybe need to go more like 12,
[02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:26.920]   but here's the deal.
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:29.600]   If you start off a session in a bad spot,
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.580]   you're not going to catch back up.
[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:34.160]   Like you're just, you're in trouble.
[02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:35.840]   Let's say you come and you follow direction.
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.600]   500 milligrams salt before, 500 milligrams after.
[02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:42.600]   Very easy rule.
[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:43.680]   Pick whatever source you want.
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:45.660]   That's a couple of sprinkles of table salt.
[02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:47.080]   If you want Himalayan, that's fine.
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:47.920]   You don't have to.
[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:49.780]   Himalayan is actually a fairly low sodium salt.
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:52.320]   So it's not the best for this purposes.
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:55.200]   If you're higher salt or sweat, a little bit more.
[02:30:55.200 --> 02:30:56.800]   If you want to go choose an electrolyte
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:59.260]   of which there are infinite,
[02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:01.040]   you can look on the packet and it'll tell you,
[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.760]   250 milligrams per serving or 400 or 600
[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:04.600]   or whatever happens to be,
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:08.240]   but around 500 pre, 500 post is a very general rule.
[02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:11.420]   And then during is thanks to you,
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:14.960]   my famous Galpin equation now that is all over the world.
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:17.040]   All I did is I took the literature and I said, okay,
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:19.320]   in general, the research shows pretty clearly
[02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:20.760]   two milligrams per kilogram body weight
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.100]   over 15 minutes seems to put you in a pretty good spot.
[02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:25.980]   Most people don't think about kilograms or milligrams.
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:27.740]   So can I just run that over?
[02:31:27.740 --> 02:31:29.220]   And it turns out it's about your body weight
[02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:31.480]   divided by 30 in ounces.
[02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:32.360]   Like that's all you have to.
[02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:33.920]   - Body weight in pounds divided by 30.
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:35.060]   - Yeah, exactly, right.
[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:37.680]   So you weigh 200 pounds divided by 30
[02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:39.540]   and that's the number of ounces.
[02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:41.840]   You don't want to go every 15 or 20 minutes.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:45.880]   - So I'm getting that amount every 15 to 20 minutes
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:46.880]   throughout the training.
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:49.200]   And now in the weight room, that's pretty easy to do
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.160]   as there are rest intervals,
[02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:54.400]   but people will need to do this while running or cycling.
[02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:57.320]   And that can cause a little bit of gastric distress
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:58.440]   if you're not used to it.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:31:59.280]   Is that right?
[02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:03.040]   And learn to run with some water in your belly?
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:03.880]   - 100%.
[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:06.600]   The gut is very trainable in a lot of directions,
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:09.280]   but in terms of fluid as well as carbohydrate,
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:12.000]   which is another thing that is going to get people.
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.300]   But that's, yeah, very trainable.
[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:14.800]   It'll be uncomfortable initially,
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.480]   but you'll quickly get into it.
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:18.360]   The better solution for those folks,
[02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:21.320]   just come in hydrated.
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:22.580]   And you might not even need any water.
[02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:25.260]   You could probably perform just fine.
[02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:27.600]   So the ones that don't have as much of an opportunity,
[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:30.400]   you really have to emphasize walking in.
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:32.880]   We have this problem with professional golfers.
[02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:34.000]   They have plenty of time to drink water,
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.600]   but they're so focused on the shot
[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:37.120]   and there's a lot of variables coming up.
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:37.960]   Once they hit their shot
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:39.600]   and they're moving on to the next one,
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:41.040]   they're thinking about,
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:44.920]   I mean, they're going over a scorecard of 185 yards away.
[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:46.480]   Can I go 184 and a half yards?
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:47.520]   Can I go 186 yards?
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:48.360]   What's the slope of that?
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.340]   What's the wind up here?
[02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:50.400]   What's the wind up there?
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:53.680]   Like there's just a thinking and they just forget.
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:55.040]   Even though they have four and a half hours,
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:56.100]   so we have to make sure
[02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:58.540]   that they immediately get off the course,
[02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:01.920]   we go right into recovery as hard as we possibly can.
[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:03.340]   They wake up the next morning, they're in a good spot.
[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.000]   We crush recovery.
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:05.840]   And now it's like,
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:08.160]   hey, if you can remember to drink this, great.
[02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:09.940]   If not, we're still fine.
[02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:14.800]   If it's not a big deal and you have time like in a lifter,
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:17.200]   because I deal with that problem with fighters too.
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:19.600]   We can only drink so much in the middle of a fight.
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:22.320]   A couple sips over there, but we can't go mix them.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:23.680]   Two milliliters, it's like,
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:24.520]   can you get a couple sips in?
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:26.380]   Oh shit, forgot, like it's not gonna happen.
[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:28.660]   So we have to take more M&M's before and after.
[02:33:28.660 --> 02:33:31.360]   So start your recovery process immediately
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:32.880]   and then come in the next day.
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:33.720]   That's your window.
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.800]   And then whatever you can get in during the workout,
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:36.640]   that's fine too.
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:38.540]   If you're a higher salt sweater,
[02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:41.940]   instead of doing 500, 500, maybe go 750, 750.
[02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:44.980]   If you have a longer bout of exercise,
[02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:48.180]   especially if it's hot or humid,
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:50.160]   then you might wanna consider some salt
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:51.640]   in the workout as well.
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:55.920]   And 300 milligrams during the workout, totally fine.
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:56.760]   It's enough.
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:59.440]   If it is a really long workout and it's really hot
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:01.440]   and you're gonna lose pounds during it,
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:02.760]   you need a specific strategy.
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:04.880]   If you're gonna lose less than a pound,
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:06.400]   you don't need to worry about it.
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:07.720]   It's not gonna be enough of a detriment
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:08.980]   for you to really care.
[02:34:08.980 --> 02:34:11.400]   So that's kind of a rough rule.
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.720]   Now, if you're 200 plus pounds,
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:16.440]   maybe that number moves from one pound to two pounds.
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:17.480]   But really the number we're looking at
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:18.840]   is what 1% of your body weight.
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:21.760]   If you're losing more than 1% of your body weight,
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:22.680]   we need to start caring.
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:23.920]   If it's less than 1%,
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:26.000]   it's not gonna really pay that much of a difference.
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.520]   - Okay, so for myself,
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:29.120]   'cause I don't get super technical,
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:32.600]   I don't wear any devices besides a wristwatch.
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:33.580]   - It's a nice watch.
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:36.540]   - Thanks, yeah, very attached to this watch,
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:38.240]   or it's attached to me, I suppose.
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:42.480]   My body weight in pounds divided by two,
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:45.720]   that's what I'm gonna try and get across the entire day
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:46.760]   as a kind of baseline.
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:50.120]   And then my body weight in pounds divided by 30
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:53.280]   during the workout, every 15 or 20 minutes,
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:55.520]   that I'm going to try and consume that amount.
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:57.480]   And then I definitely do better
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:34:58.920]   when I increase the amount of salt
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.600]   that I'm taking in anywhere from 500 milligrams
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:05.780]   to a gram of salt, several times a day, actually.
[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:07.560]   But I'm not eating that often,
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:09.280]   which leads me to my other question,
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:13.280]   which is I prefer to train fasted or semi-fasted,
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:15.320]   meaning first thing in the morning
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:17.600]   or within an hour or two of waking,
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:19.120]   obviously I've been fasting while I'm asleep,
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:20.720]   or having not eaten anything
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:22.040]   for three or four hours before.
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:26.140]   I just feel lighter and more energetic.
[02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:28.880]   If that works for me, is that okay?
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.100]   Or should I try, is it better to eat something
[02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:33.560]   before one trains?
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:34.660]   - Personal preference.
[02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:37.320]   Easy answer there.
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:41.880]   It depends on, of course, how hard you trained,
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:42.760]   what the training was like,
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:43.980]   what sport you're involved with,
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.080]   how many total counts, et cetera.
[02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:48.960]   But in general, personal preference for the average person.
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.540]   - And that probably handles 90% of the questions about that.
[02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:55.280]   Cold.
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:58.400]   Cold showers, ice baths, and cold immersion up to the neck.
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:00.080]   I always preface this by saying
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:01.680]   there are not a lot of studies.
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:04.060]   There are some, but not a lot of controlled studies
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:07.200]   looking at cold showers 'cause it's harder to control
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:08.800]   the variables of where people stand.
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.960]   So I would say if you have access to cold immersion
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.980]   of some sort, ice bath or cold immersion, great.
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:17.240]   But if you don't, cold showers will be the next best thing.
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:21.140]   The lore goes that if you do an ice bath
[02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:23.220]   or cold water immersion after strength
[02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:24.640]   or hypertrophy training,
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:27.380]   that you are short-circuiting some of that.
[02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:31.240]   The lore also goes that cold showers might be okay.
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:36.240]   And my interpretation of those data and that discussion
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:39.360]   is that all that is probably true,
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:41.700]   but I have a hard time imagining
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:44.480]   that the effects are so robust
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:46.760]   that it can completely prevent strength gains
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:49.580]   and hypertrophy such that my stance for myself
[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:52.020]   is try and do the cold exposure training
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:54.480]   away from the strength and hypertrophy training.
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:57.060]   But if you can't do it any other time,
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:36:59.280]   right afterward probably isn't going to throw
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:04.280]   my whole system out of whack and prevent the improvements.
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:05.780]   Am I deluding myself?
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:08.320]   - Couple of caveats here.
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:11.140]   Number one, I would say I have a personal vested interest
[02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:12.020]   in cold.
[02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:14.160]   I've been around this stuff for a long time.
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:18.960]   Being involved and being an advisor for XPT
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:20.720]   and being in this space a long time,
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:23.400]   I'm a big believer in cold, especially cold water.
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:24.440]   - Deliberate cold exposure.
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:25.520]   - 100%, right?
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.520]   So that being said, I do think getting into an ice bath
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.320]   immediately after a hypertrophy session
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:35.480]   is getting pretty close to,
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:37.600]   you just shouldn't have done the session.
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:38.760]   It is detrimental.
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.600]   - Good to know.
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:40.620]   - I wouldn't do it.
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:42.780]   I guess it's the most blunt way to put it.
[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:46.860]   If you're like, hey,
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:50.400]   I'm not super concerned with growing muscle
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:53.440]   and I want these other things
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:56.320]   that come with cold water immersion, fine.
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:59.660]   It's not zero, it's not taking you backwards.
[02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:00.800]   How much does it cut you down?
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:01.640]   I don't know.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:04.360]   We don't know, that'd be a difficult number to come up with.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.600]   Is it 1% reduction?
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.000]   No, it's more than that.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:07.820]   Is it 100?
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:08.760]   Not even close.
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:09.960]   I don't know where it lands though.
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:11.400]   It's enough though for me to go,
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:12.840]   in general, best practices,
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:14.700]   don't get in the ice immediately after a workout.
[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:15.940]   - How long should I wait?
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:17.820]   - Well, in theory,
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:20.000]   the best answer we could give you would be four hours
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.780]   because of what we talked about earlier today of going,
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:24.940]   okay, immediately you've got this signaling cascade
[02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:25.920]   that takes seconds.
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:26.860]   You've got gene expression
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:28.740]   that's happening in this rough four-hour window.
[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.060]   After the genes have gone off
[02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:31.900]   and now you're just going through
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.320]   the protein synthesis process,
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:34.220]   the signal's already there
[02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:35.420]   and it's gone back down to baseline.
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:37.960]   So then reintroducing cold here
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:40.460]   is not gonna disrupt that signal.
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:44.200]   That's a very non-scientifically founded,
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:46.800]   because we don't know at this point at all.
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:48.800]   What is very clear though is if you get off your workout,
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:49.960]   go right into the ice,
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.060]   it's probably 10% attenuation of growth.
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:55.560]   I don't know, maybe more, depends on the person.
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:57.040]   Some people, if you look at the individual data,
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:58.180]   it's pretty bad.
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:00.780]   It's enough to where it's like, that's a really big deal.
[02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.720]   The benefits of the ice, I don't think now outweigh
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:05.800]   the benefits of hypertrophy training.
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:07.600]   - What about cold showers?
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:10.520]   - I don't think cold showers are gonna do much.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.360]   If you've been in both, you know that this is,
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.080]   like we're not playing the same game here.
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:16.560]   - An ice bath or a true cold water immersion
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:20.520]   up to the neck with limbs in for one to five minutes
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:23.560]   is a completely different stimulus than in the cold shower.
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:25.900]   - Especially also compared to a similar cryo.
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:29.080]   It's not even the same thing here.
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:30.960]   So in general, I would say don't do those.
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:33.300]   Cold shower, I don't really care.
[02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:35.280]   Can you work it out so you don't do them at the same time?
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:37.240]   That would be my hope, right?
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:39.200]   I would actually prefer you do the cold before,
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:40.680]   if you really had to do it.
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.160]   - Certainly will wake you up, get that adrenaline burst.
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:47.500]   - No, we've played with that actually years ago doing that.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:48.920]   There's actually some fun stuff you can do
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:50.960]   with the endurance piece with cold stuff,
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:53.120]   but it's totally not feasible for most people
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:55.560]   'cause you're getting water everywhere.
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:57.360]   They're gonna jump on your bike and just get shit,
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:58.720]   and it's just a giant mess.
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:01.560]   It's fun, but yeah, I would say walk away from it
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:04.520]   if you can, that's actually where I stand based on the data.
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:07.120]   Based on my intuition and experience,
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:08.480]   I don't think it's a good thing to do.
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:10.360]   Now, having said that,
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:13.520]   that's mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy.
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:14.840]   Strength is not as clear.
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:17.600]   There are some data to show it in actual blocks,
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:18.420]   strength adaptations,
[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:19.800]   but because of what we talked about earlier,
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:22.640]   the mechanisms and the drivers are different.
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:24.760]   And so I don't think it's as big a concern
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:27.100]   for strength development,
[02:40:27.100 --> 02:40:28.120]   though I would still generally say
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:29.920]   if you can get away with staying out of the ice
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:31.000]   immediately after the workout
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.820]   and you can at least wait a few hours,
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:34.180]   that's the better approach.
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:37.180]   Less concerned with strength, more concerned with hypertrophy
[02:40:37.180 --> 02:40:38.720]   in terms of interference effect.
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:41.820]   If you can do it on off days or before or any other time,
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:43.540]   that's the place to land.
[02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:45.320]   - That's generally when I try to do it.
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:46.940]   I was just kind of throwing out an extreme case
[02:40:46.940 --> 02:40:48.500]   'cause I get asked that question a lot.
[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:52.100]   What about the use of ice bath or cold water immersion
[02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:54.300]   or cold shower after endurance training?
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:56.520]   - Okay, so a couple of interesting things here.
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:40:59.120]   You mentioned we don't have a tremendous amount of data
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:02.440]   on cold water immersion overall.
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:03.840]   So a lot of this is moving.
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:07.560]   There have been some papers to show
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:08.460]   that cold water immersion
[02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:10.920]   can actually enhance mitochondrial biogenesis.
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:12.680]   And actually even for endurance stuff,
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:14.880]   it's been shown to cause improvement
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:17.520]   in endurance adaptations relative to not.
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:20.820]   It's not enough for me to be truly confident
[02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:21.660]   in that statement yet.
[02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:23.100]   I would like to see that repeated.
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:25.420]   Not that I have a problem with the paper or the methodology
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:26.560]   that they use in that particular study,
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:30.620]   but this is a weird thing.
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:32.000]   So I wanna see this repeated more often.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.640]   So I have less concern
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:35.560]   with doing it immediately post endurance
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.900]   'cause you could even argue that there may be some benefit.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:40.000]   I don't think you need to go out of your way
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.040]   to try to make sure you get into ice immediately afterwards
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.240]   and thinking you're gonna get some massive adaptation.
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:49.480]   We use ice a decent amount when I can get athletes to do it,
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:50.920]   but this context is different.
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:52.280]   Number one, when we're in camp
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:54.460]   and we've got a world title fight coming up
[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:56.060]   or something else,
[02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:58.600]   we've just pitched in a major baseball game,
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:00.980]   I am not concerned about hypertrophy.
[02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:02.420]   I am not even concerned with strength development.
[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.240]   I am now pushing towards recovery.
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.960]   There's a paradigm that I think is important
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:07.320]   with all of these things to understand,
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:10.400]   which is are you pushing for optimization or adaptation?
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:13.440]   When you're pushing for adaptation,
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:15.800]   you don't wanna block the signal for adaptation.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:17.440]   This means less recovery.
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:18.960]   You're not going to feel as good,
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:22.040]   and you probably should be hedging towards stress.
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:24.780]   When you're pushing for optimization, it's the opposite.
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:27.000]   So if I'm in season and I had a pitcher
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.320]   just throw 125 pitches,
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:30.920]   I'm not trying to cause adaptation.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:32.500]   I'm trying to recover as quickly as possible
[02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:34.360]   because four days from now, we gotta do this again,
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:36.920]   and I gotta do this across 162 games.
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:40.800]   You're gonna play five days in a PGA golf tournament,
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:42.380]   and you're gonna have to do it again every week
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:44.720]   for a bunch of weeks in a row.
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:47.360]   I need recovery as fast as I possibly can.
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:48.940]   So if I'm blunting adaptation, fine.
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:49.960]   I'm not actually trying to do that.
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.520]   I'm trying to optimize.
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:54.360]   If you spend all of your time in one of those two areas,
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:55.400]   you're gonna have problems.
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.360]   So you need to be judicious about thinking,
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:00.320]   is this a point in my life or training cycle
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:02.440]   that I want to cause adaptations
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:04.640]   or am I trying to optimize?
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:06.240]   If you spend too much time in one of the other ones,
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.920]   again, you're gonna have problems.
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:11.640]   So that's generally how I will treat the ice
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:13.400]   for all those adaptations.
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:15.420]   - What about heat?
[02:43:15.420 --> 02:43:16.260]   - Yeah.
[02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:18.740]   - When, and I'll frame this question differently
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:20.800]   because I'm sure there are a number of ways
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:23.100]   in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things.
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:25.960]   I mean, heat in excess can kill you.
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:26.880]   - Yeah.
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:28.400]   - It can shut down fertility.
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:30.760]   It can in excess, right?
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:32.200]   It can do all sorts of things,
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:34.640]   but it can also increase growth hormone,
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.080]   increase vasodilation, improve one's ability to sweat,
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:40.680]   which can be very beneficial in a number of contexts.
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:44.940]   For the typical, for 75% of people, 75% of the time,
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:47.780]   when do you think heat is most useful?
[02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:50.400]   And here I'm referring to dry sauna or wet sauna.
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:52.640]   I'm not specifically talking about infrared sauna
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:54.760]   because the data there are a little unclear to me.
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.960]   And I don't even know that,
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:58.640]   my sense with infrared saunas is they don't go hot enough
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:00.080]   for my particular taste.
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:01.440]   - You and I have a similar taste there.
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:02.280]   - Okay.
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:04.080]   - We're not crushing 200 past, I'm not interested.
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:06.820]   - Right, and my sense about infrared sauna
[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:09.520]   is that maybe I haven't seen the data is that,
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:11.720]   but that a lot of people like it
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:13.840]   'cause they like the way they look in the infrared sauna.
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:14.680]   It feels cool.
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:15.880]   It feels like you're doing something unusual.
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:19.360]   Now, infrared lights are beneficial for other reasons,
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:21.120]   actually for mitochondrial health and the retinas,
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:22.120]   they're good data.
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.400]   But infrared sauna to me, it never goes hot enough.
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:29.020]   So I'm talking about 200 or hotter, maybe 180 to 220,
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:30.560]   obviously do what's safe folks
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:33.320]   and heed all the warnings about pregnant people
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:34.400]   not going in saunas, et cetera.
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:36.480]   - I assume you're lumping in hot water immersion.
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:39.960]   - Hot water immersion, so hot baths, hot sauna.
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:41.120]   When would you like,
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:44.440]   when do you think most people could leverage sauna
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:46.720]   or hot baths to benefit their training
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:48.360]   and fitness and health?
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:49.840]   - Yeah, okay, I have a handful of things
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:50.760]   to say about this topic.
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:52.880]   One of them is you never have a hard time
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:54.720]   convincing people to get hot.
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:56.460]   Everyone feels good, like, yeah, getting a hot bath,
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:57.600]   like can you take more hot showers?
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:00.660]   Sure, like no problem there, right?
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:05.000]   There are a handful of studies that have looked at this
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.480]   immediately post and it seems to even augment hypertrophy.
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:09.880]   - So after hypertrophy training,
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.200]   getting in the sauna for 20 minutes?
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:13.860]   - Yeah, whatever, whatever it needs to be.
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:15.480]   We don't have a good titration.
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:16.980]   What's the number, minutes wise,
[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:18.640]   we don't have a temperature titration.
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:21.680]   - Hot shower would be a second,
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:23.520]   that would be a week second best.
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:25.000]   - I would say it's a very week.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:26.060]   - Take a hot bath.
[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:28.360]   - I think a hot bath is probably a lot closer
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:30.160]   to what you're looking for.
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:30.980]   It actually kind of goes back
[02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:32.400]   to our initial conversations.
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:37.280]   Theoretically, you're just going to aid in blood flow.
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:38.800]   So you're gonna put more nutrients in,
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:40.840]   more waste product out, metabolic stress,
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:41.880]   all that stuff is going through.
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:45.480]   So that's the thought anyways, far from no ends.
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:48.260]   Plausible, right, absolutely plausible.
[02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:50.320]   Something people will do, feels good.
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:55.240]   Let's say with cold and hot, I want to caution you
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:56.960]   against a couple of things.
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:45:58.440]   This is true across all physiology,
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.300]   but you need to be really careful about moving percentages
[02:46:02.300 --> 02:46:06.200]   from molecular to outcome, very careful.
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:10.560]   So for example, it's easy to see a paper that says,
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:12.160]   okay, we put you in a hot bath or something
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:14.540]   and we saw a growth hormone increase 300%.
[02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:18.100]   That is not going to result in 300% increase
[02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:20.380]   in muscle size, right?
[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:24.580]   In fact, 300% might result in absolutely no change
[02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:25.540]   in physical size, right?
[02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:28.000]   So the, and the reason I'm saying this
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:29.440]   is because there's a lot of people in this space
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:31.640]   that will misapply the mechanisms
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:34.760]   and they'll grossly overestimate what these things can do
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.040]   and what they do do because they'll find something like that
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:40.240]   I mean, you know this, you've done enough cellular work too.
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.480]   In the lab, if I see mTOR doubled,
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:46.480]   I think, shit, it didn't work.
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:47.580]   I need to see a 10X increase
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:49.920]   before I know it's even physiologically relevant.
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:52.540]   So reading that paper, reading someone's social media post,
[02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:54.780]   you're like, wow, it increased mTOR 38%.
[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:55.920]   I'm like, well, that didn't work.
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:56.820]   And you're like, wow, that's huge.
[02:46:56.820 --> 02:46:59.480]   I'm like, that's not 38% increase in muscle size.
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:00.920]   So that's a very important point I want to make
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:03.920]   because I'm going to talk about the benefits here in a second
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:06.200]   but I don't want people to be fooled
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:09.040]   into thinking that this is some crazy miracle.
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:11.320]   The same thing with the sauna.
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:13.640]   In terms of general health outcomes,
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:15.740]   it is clearly a beneficial thing.
[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:18.240]   This is a really good idea to get hot a lot.
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:20.920]   It is not a substitute for exercise though.
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:22.320]   It's a very important distinction.
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:27.320]   If the options are nothing or sauna, get in the sauna.
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:29.640]   Really, really good idea.
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:31.240]   If the exchange is though,
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:35.240]   I don't need to work out because I did the sauna, bad.
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:36.720]   This is not a winning solution.
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:38.420]   - You and I know some maniacs
[02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:39.840]   that actually work out in the sauna.
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:41.120]   - Oh, we do, yeah.
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:42.760]   - I don't necessarily recommend that.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:46.360]   That actually would probably kill a large number of people
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:50.480]   but it can be worked up to it certainly.
[02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:53.240]   - Yeah, so like every time I talk about that,
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:56.940]   I flag that because it's just too easy to hear that and go,
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:47:58.340]   "Oh, well I think Dr. Huberman said,
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:00.100]   "if I just get in the sauna, I don't have to work out."
[02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:00.940]   Like, no, no.
[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:01.780]   Those words have never come out of his mouth.
[02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:02.720]   - It definitely didn't say that.
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:04.440]   And I'm definitely not working out in the sauna.
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:07.120]   If I'm in the sauna, I'm either sitting or I'm lying down
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:08.280]   and I'm trying to make it through.
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:12.100]   I tend to do three 20-minute bouts across the entire week.
[02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:15.360]   So I aim for 60 minutes per week of heat exposure,
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:16.320]   which is not a ton.
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:18.480]   - If I said I've never worked out in the sauna.
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:19.800]   - Oh, so you're one of those.
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:21.160]   Yeah, people will do air squats.
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:23.040]   They'll bring the Airdyne bike in there.
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:25.680]   I look at the sauna as kind of a time to get lazy and sweat.
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:26.520]   - Totally fine.
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:28.920]   Going back to your general question.
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:30.520]   So potential to aid, plausible aid.
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:33.040]   We need to see more research on that to really get a,
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:34.120]   do I need to put this in practice?
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:36.800]   I think if you try it, very little harm.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.560]   I struggle to see a downside
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:41.600]   if you make sure your hydration's on point, right?
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:42.760]   'Cause now you've got to factor in the fact
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:44.040]   you just kicked out two or three pounds.
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.280]   If you're you at 200 plus pounds, I assume, or roughly,
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:49.360]   if you're in the sauna for 20 minutes,
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:51.260]   I would imagine you can do two, three pounds.
[02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:55.160]   - Yeah, usually I'm hover somewhere around like 225.
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:59.260]   And I drink, I drink at 32 ounce.
[02:48:59.260 --> 02:49:00.100]   - Right.
[02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:01.980]   - It's water with a electrolyte solution
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:04.680]   that's pretty high salt afterwards and sometimes during.
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:07.380]   And sometimes after that, if I do it late in the evening,
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:09.620]   I'll go to sleep and I'll wake up in the middle of the night
[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:12.100]   just feeling so parched.
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:14.700]   It's amazing how much water one loses in the sauna.
[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:17.720]   - Like a normal sweat rate for someone 225, especially,
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:18.940]   and 20 minutes in a sauna,
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:22.020]   I would absolutely expect you to do three pounds.
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:22.860]   Easy, without like really-
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:24.980]   - So I should be drinking more, probably even more water.
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:26.980]   - Yeah, you're probably half the water that you need to get.
[02:49:26.980 --> 02:49:29.820]   - And you mentioned the possible benefits of doing it
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:31.460]   after strength hypertrophy training,
[02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:35.620]   which makes sense for plausible mechanistic reasons
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:37.860]   on no official data there yet.
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:39.540]   What about after endurance training?
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:41.180]   Assuming somebody hydrates well enough
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:43.220]   and they're not overheated from their endurance work.
[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:44.060]   - Yep.
[02:49:44.060 --> 02:49:44.880]   - Could also be a benefit.
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:45.720]   - Yeah.
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:48.520]   - Wow, so more and more what I'm thinking the framework here
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:52.900]   is in an ideal world, one would train and then do sauna
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:54.900]   or heat exposure of some kind,
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:56.940]   endurance training or strength hypertrophy training
[02:49:56.940 --> 02:49:59.940]   and then do sauna and then do cold exposure
[02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:03.180]   on off days or at least four hours away
[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:05.020]   from any kind of training.
[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:06.540]   Or if you had to do it close to train,
[02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:07.460]   do it before training.
[02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:09.540]   - Yeah, I love cold in the morning.
[02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:11.620]   We've actually run this experiment on professional athletes
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:14.420]   where we do enough tracking with things like HRV,
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:18.260]   which is a global metric of like overall fatigue.
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:19.980]   Okay, and you've probably talked about that before,
[02:50:19.980 --> 02:50:23.500]   but problems with it, but roughly idea of overall fatigue.
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:26.180]   HRV in general, higher the score, the better, right?
[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:29.160]   So low HRV is fatigue, right?
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:32.380]   Well, if you wake up and take your HRV in the morning
[02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:33.880]   and then you get into ice, what's gonna happen
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.700]   is you're gonna see that number plummet.
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:37.780]   The second you get out, that's gonna fall off the earth,
[02:50:37.780 --> 02:50:40.860]   which means roughly you've moved into a sympathetic place.
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:46.020]   Surprising, you get in 30 degree water,
[02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:48.060]   you're gonna go very sympathetic very quickly.
[02:50:48.060 --> 02:50:52.440]   However, if you continue to watch your HRV for 30, 60, 90,
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:54.140]   and up to two to three hours post,
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:57.900]   you will generally see an improved HRV score
[02:50:57.900 --> 02:50:59.380]   relative to where you started.
[02:50:59.380 --> 02:51:02.700]   So it's back to this hormetic stressor, right?
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:06.780]   A really cold, shocking exposure will be a net result
[02:51:06.780 --> 02:51:09.940]   of you being more relaxed throughout the day in general.
[02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:12.180]   And we've seen that now like very consistently
[02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:14.160]   across years with athletes.
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:16.460]   So I think it's a great way to start your day.
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:19.460]   You won't need nearly as much coffee
[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:22.660]   after spending three minutes in 30 degree water.
[02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:24.660]   - 30 degrees is pretty darn cold.
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:27.220]   I was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes.
[02:51:27.220 --> 02:51:28.900]   It felt, I didn't bring a thermometer,
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:31.820]   but it felt like somewhere in the low 50s.
[02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:34.140]   - But 50 and moving is really cold.
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:35.620]   - Yeah. - Water's moving, right?
[02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:36.660]   That's really cold.
[02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:37.500]   - That's right.
[02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:39.380]   The thermal layer that surrounds you
[02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:41.660]   when you sit still in a cold water immersion,
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:43.700]   I'm encouraging people now, if they really,
[02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:46.300]   I always joke that people like to look real stoic
[02:51:46.300 --> 02:51:47.200]   and tough when they're in there.
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:48.960]   Like they're just grinding through it with no pain at all.
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:52.780]   But the stillness is actually reducing the stimulus.
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:54.100]   If they sift around a little bit,
[02:51:54.100 --> 02:51:55.140]   you break up that thermal layer,
[02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:56.340]   that's where the real action is.
[02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:57.940]   - We've joked about this for years.
[02:51:57.940 --> 02:52:01.200]   Like do 50 degrees with a Whirlpool jet on.
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:02.460]   Now I'm impressed.
[02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:03.600]   'Cause that is hard.
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:05.460]   You sit in 35 degree for three minutes.
[02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:08.100]   I guess, but with XBT, I've seen,
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:10.060]   I can't even tell you how many hundreds of people
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:12.020]   from all walks of life on all age
[02:52:12.020 --> 02:52:15.720]   that we've been able to get in 30 some degree water
[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:17.140]   for three minutes.
[02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:19.300]   50 degrees with a Whirlpool going,
[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:20.540]   that number gets very small.
[02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:22.440]   - Yeah, and if you don't have access to a Whirlpool,
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:24.480]   this should be reassuring to you.
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:26.540]   Some people say, "Oh, I don't have access to ice."
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:27.900]   And ice can actually get pretty expensive
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:29.540]   if you're doing a $50 ice bath every day.
[02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:33.600]   So you can fill your bathtub with cool to cold water.
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:35.280]   Get in, but just make sure that you keep sifting
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:37.440]   in your limbs and it's chilly.
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:40.580]   And the studies on the very well,
[02:52:40.580 --> 02:52:43.240]   now well-established increases in dopamine and epinephrine
[02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:44.400]   that occur in cold water exposure
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:48.180]   were actually done at an hour in 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:52:48.180 --> 02:52:51.220]   And so you don't necessarily need it ice cold
[02:52:51.220 --> 02:52:52.100]   or an ice bath,
[02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:54.140]   but immersion is really better than the cold shower.
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:55.900]   The cold shower is kind of a,
[02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:59.580]   it's the, it's kind of the espresso shot version.
[02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:01.060]   - Yep, no, it's sort of funny
[02:53:01.060 --> 02:53:03.900]   'cause if you look at most of those initial studies
[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:05.680]   and you think, man,
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:07.680]   how did they get people to sign up
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:11.220]   to spend 45 minutes in 55 degree water?
[02:53:11.220 --> 02:53:13.060]   55 degrees is cold, even if it's not moving.
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:14.540]   And then they're gonna not spend five minutes in them,
[02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:15.760]   they're gonna go an hour.
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:17.360]   If you've ever done ice baths at that temperature,
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:19.420]   you know, like, all right, after a few minutes,
[02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:22.040]   it's not that bad, but man, that's a protocol.
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:25.020]   - Yeah, it's kind of a cold endurance protocol.
[02:53:25.020 --> 02:53:26.460]   'Cause it's one thing to get in for one minute
[02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:28.040]   to three minutes and you know you're getting out.
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:28.980]   You could sing a song,
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:30.360]   you could do anything to distract yourself,
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:33.920]   but 45 minutes to an hour is intense.
[02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:34.760]   Maybe they, I don't know,
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:36.020]   I don't think they paid the subjects,
[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:38.760]   but anyway, that study was done in Europe.
[02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:39.940]   I forget where it was done,
[02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:43.340]   but anyway, they were hardy subjects.
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:48.600]   I wanna talk a bit about over-training and gauging recovery.
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:53.400]   So there are a couple of methods that I've heard about
[02:53:53.400 --> 02:53:56.900]   and that I use based on some data that I've seen,
[02:53:56.900 --> 02:53:58.960]   but mainly discussions with really informed people
[02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:03.560]   like yourself, Brian McKenzie, Kelly Starrett, and others.
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:06.380]   The two that I'm aware of for gauging recovery
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:09.640]   of the nervous system and kind of systemic recovery
[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:11.360]   are grip strength,
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:14.520]   especially grip strength on waking in the morning
[02:54:14.520 --> 02:54:18.360]   and the so-called carbon dioxide tolerance test,
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:21.180]   the ability to do a long controlled exhale
[02:54:21.180 --> 02:54:23.720]   after a few rhythmic deep breaths,
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:28.160]   just which I'm assuming taps into both one's ability
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:30.360]   to mechanically control the diaphragm,
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:33.640]   but also how well one is regulating carbon dioxide.
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:38.440]   First question is, is this stuff fiction, fact,
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:43.120]   or a combination of kind of anecdata, as I call it?
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:45.100]   Are there any peer-reviewed published data?
[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:46.440]   Is your lab working on these things
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:50.720]   and am I deluding myself using these tools or are they useful?
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:53.240]   - It's not fiction at all.
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:56.160]   There are, with like CO2 tolerance,
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:57.520]   there's less published data.
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:01.640]   We've run a study in our lab looking at the associations
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:02.800]   between the CO2 tolerance
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:05.720]   and what we call trait and state anxiety.
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:10.080]   And those are in the publication process is what I'll say.
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:12.320]   So you can't really talk about that stuff, as you know,
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:13.160]   until it's out.
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:16.640]   But in general, I'd say there's a reason I'm still doing it.
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:17.780]   I'll just leave it at that.
[02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:19.320]   - Yeah, well, assuming it's not a clinical trial,
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:21.720]   I mean, I think sharing preliminary findings
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.120]   is fine as long as we highlight them as preliminary.
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:25.220]   I'm not a reviewer,
[02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:26.600]   but I look forward to reading the paper.
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:28.840]   - Yeah, but as you know, scientific, ethically,
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:31.780]   like you need to be careful about telling people results
[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:32.800]   before you've gone through that process.
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:34.160]   - Right, which is why I'm flagging this
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:37.480]   as these results are not yet passed through
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:38.480]   the peer review process.
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:40.560]   So you're hearing about it prior to peer review.
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:44.320]   - Yep, having said that, there's enough in that field.
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:45.800]   I'm not the first one into that field.
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:48.880]   And so I'm very confident that that's a real thing.
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.120]   I mean, in terms of actual tracking and recovery,
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:53.520]   the big picture is this.
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.760]   When we run through a full analysis,
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:57.080]   when we have an athlete go through
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:55:59.820]   a biomolecular athlete program,
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:02.280]   we're gonna run and we're looking at three major categories.
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:05.080]   Okay, category one are what we call visible stressors,
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:06.880]   and then we have hidden stressors,
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:09.000]   and then we have recovery capacity.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:14.840]   Any time the total stress load outpaces recovery capacity,
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:19.360]   you're either going backwards in your physical ability
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:21.120]   or you're reducing adaptability.
[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:23.000]   Now you have levers to pull here.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.880]   You can reduce stress intake or you can increase recovery
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:27.880]   capacity, right?
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:30.880]   What we want in an ideal situation is to be able to implement
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.640]   the most stress possible,
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:35.820]   because that's the driver of adaptation, recover from that.
[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:37.040]   Now we get the most adaptation,
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:38.940]   and adaptation being simply a change,
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:39.940]   whatever change you want it to be.
[02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:41.480]   That's our gold standard, right?
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:42.400]   It's pie in the eye.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.040]   Some people have endogenous differences.
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:46.080]   They just recover better, they don't.
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:47.000]   There are genetic factors,
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.060]   but let's talk about the ones that are manipulatable.
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:52.160]   If we go to the stress side of it,
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:54.460]   you want the throttle to be pushed as far down
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:56.160]   on the ones you want stress from,
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:58.720]   and as far off of the ones you don't want stress,
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:01.800]   so that the adaptation comes in the exact area you want,
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:02.880]   and you're not burning gas
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:04.460]   in something you don't care about,
[02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:08.400]   because you're taking that total stress bucket too high.
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:09.780]   Recovery capacity over there.
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:10.900]   So here's how you can do that.
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:12.620]   You can run some analytics and measure what we do
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:15.740]   with everyone through these very comprehensive breakdowns
[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:18.400]   to figure out what's that physiology look like hidden
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:21.080]   and visible, and then what's the recovery capacity.
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:22.720]   Once we have that blueprint,
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:24.960]   we can now figure out what are the two or three things
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:28.040]   we need to track that are these indicators
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:30.300]   of what we call performance anchors.
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:32.520]   So an anchor is something that kind of drags behind you
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:34.980]   or below you that slows you down.
[02:57:34.980 --> 02:57:37.720]   The analogy being, let's say we're going down
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:39.680]   one of these amazing canyon roads,
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:41.160]   and I won't say which canyon we're in,
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:43.100]   so you can stay hidden here,
[02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:46.240]   and your car's going down at a certain velocity,
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:47.960]   and you want to go faster.
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:51.480]   Most people's first impulse is to hit the gas,
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:52.680]   the accelerator.
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:54.080]   We want to push.
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:56.480]   Well, that's fine, but if your foot is on the brake
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:57.840]   and you push the accelerator,
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:00.200]   you might go a little bit faster, but number one,
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:02.280]   you're wasting a lot of literal gas
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:03.320]   to go a little bit faster,
[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:05.960]   and two, you're burning your engine.
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:07.360]   You're gonna blow.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.600]   The easier solution is just take your foot off the brake.
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:13.100]   You're going to go faster by just stopping yourself.
[02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:16.020]   Then if that's not fast enough, we can hit the accelerator.
[02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:18.700]   Everyone wants to just push down, right?
[02:58:18.700 --> 02:58:20.340]   More stimulants, more optimization,
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:21.300]   bing, bing, bing, bing here.
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:25.100]   Our first analytics are where are these performance anchors?
[02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:26.200]   What's dragging you back?
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:29.260]   What's putting down the brake?
[02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:31.020]   I want to move those two or three things out of the way,
[02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:32.760]   and now let's see how far you get.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.060]   Oh, look at that.
[02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:35.940]   Your recovery capacity has gone way up.
[02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:38.700]   Your adaptations are happening faster now,
[02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:41.260]   or we can do more work because you're recovering quicker,
[02:58:41.260 --> 02:58:43.020]   so we're trying to figure out in those buckets,
[02:58:43.020 --> 02:58:44.660]   and we have a whole host of things that we measure,
[02:58:44.660 --> 02:58:47.300]   biomarkers and surveys and everything else
[02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:50.140]   that we go through to find out what's there.
[02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:52.340]   So after we've done that, now we're just gonna track
[02:58:52.340 --> 02:58:54.320]   a few of these recovery markers along the way
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:56.360]   to figure out what's globally happening.
[02:58:56.360 --> 02:58:59.040]   So that could mean grip strength.
[02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:01.700]   I have some folks who we're gonna test grip strength daily.
[02:59:01.700 --> 02:59:04.220]   Others, we're gonna look at HRV or combinations.
[02:59:04.220 --> 02:59:07.380]   We may look at performance metrics like a force plate.
[02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:09.800]   So you're gonna do a vertical jump every single day,
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:10.720]   and we're gonna see where that's at.
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:12.400]   We've used the tap test before,
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:14.460]   which is how many times you can tap your fingers
[02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:15.980]   as fast as possible.
[02:59:15.980 --> 02:59:18.500]   It's a rough indicator of central nervous system.
[02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:20.020]   - In a, say, one minute interval?
[02:59:20.020 --> 02:59:20.860]   - Exactly.
[02:59:20.860 --> 02:59:21.860]   And there's just apps you can do on this.
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:23.420]   Like, you tap his finger as fast as you can.
[02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:25.240]   It's gonna say, "Hey, you did 60 taps today,
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:26.820]   and your average is 75."
[02:59:26.820 --> 02:59:30.540]   - I like that 'cause it taps into, ha, no pun intended,
[02:59:30.540 --> 02:59:33.220]   into upper motor neuron capacity,
[02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:34.980]   because a lot of things, like grip strength,
[02:59:34.980 --> 02:59:36.520]   obviously I have to send the deliberate signal
[02:59:36.520 --> 02:59:38.120]   to my hand to grip, but at some point,
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:39.900]   the lower motor neurons are gonna be taking over
[02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:40.740]   the majority of the work.
[02:59:40.740 --> 02:59:42.340]   Like, the signal is probably one and done,
[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:47.080]   whereas the tapping is going to be repetitive,
[02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:49.900]   sending of signals from upper motor neurons.
[02:59:49.900 --> 02:59:52.140]   - Yep, so some of the athletes I work with,
[02:59:52.140 --> 02:59:53.940]   we track blood every day.
[02:59:53.940 --> 02:59:55.100]   We track urine every day.
[02:59:55.100 --> 02:59:58.000]   We track, ideally, a combination of subjective
[02:59:58.000 --> 02:59:59.180]   and objective measures.
[02:59:59.180 --> 03:00:01.500]   Everything from how did you feel last night
[03:00:01.500 --> 03:00:04.100]   to environmental sensors of their bedroom,
[03:00:04.100 --> 03:00:08.000]   full PSGs going on, running, like, actual sleep diagnostics,
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:09.480]   not an aura ring, nothing against aura,
[03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:10.540]   but, like, full analytics.
[03:00:10.540 --> 03:00:12.700]   'Cause some of them, it's as simple as
[03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:15.740]   how'd you feel today, and what was your vertical jump?
[03:00:15.740 --> 03:00:16.780]   Right, so we're going to put people
[03:00:16.780 --> 03:00:17.740]   in a position to succeed.
[03:00:17.740 --> 03:00:19.020]   We're gonna figure out what's the lever
[03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:21.400]   that they need to pull, as well as what's their aptitude,
[03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:22.300]   what sport are they in,
[03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:23.840]   what can we realistically get away with.
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:26.460]   And some of them will take machines with them,
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:27.820]   and we'll do blood every day, and urine,
[03:00:27.820 --> 03:00:28.980]   and all kinds of stuff.
[03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:31.060]   And some of them, it's a lot lower.
[03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:33.940]   - For myself, I'm not, as I mentioned before,
[03:00:33.940 --> 03:00:35.540]   I'm not a big fan of devices.
[03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:37.660]   I'm trying to wear the wristwatch.
[03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:41.540]   I tend to go off feel, which is not,
[03:00:41.540 --> 03:00:43.940]   it's not the ideal objective way to gauge things.
[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:48.120]   But part of my reasoning for this is my colleague
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:51.380]   from the psychology department, Dr. Alia Crum,
[03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:53.980]   has done some studies where they've given,
[03:00:53.980 --> 03:00:56.660]   deliberately given people false feedback about their sleep.
[03:00:56.660 --> 03:00:58.380]   So told people you didn't sleep very well,
[03:00:58.380 --> 03:01:00.580]   or they've told people you slept really well.
[03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:04.440]   And performance can be driven in the expected direction
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:06.820]   based on feedback, independent of how well people slept
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:07.700]   and didn't sleep.
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:09.020]   Now, that doesn't mean you can take someone
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:12.380]   that only slept two hours or was up every 30 seconds
[03:01:12.380 --> 03:01:13.960]   'cause of apnea and tell them they slept great
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:15.960]   and they're going to perform great cognitive tasks.
[03:01:15.960 --> 03:01:18.640]   But you can take someone who slept very well,
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:20.700]   tell them that their recovery quotient wasn't very good
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:23.020]   and their output is going to be worse.
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:25.340]   And that's my concern about a lot of devices out there,
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:26.840]   not to name specific devices,
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:30.600]   but it's still unclear to the general public
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:32.560]   what the specific algorithms are
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:34.920]   to generate these recovery scores, right?
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:39.160]   And so many of the things that reportedly track sleep
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:40.420]   aren't tracking sleep,
[03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:42.160]   they're tracking heart rate and breathing,
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:44.760]   which are correlates of sleep depth, but that's different.
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.060]   And again, I'm not knocking on those.
[03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:48.600]   I think the sleep trackers, if nothing else,
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:51.080]   have provided a forum whereby people are very conscious
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:52.560]   of getting good sleep.
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:55.280]   It's sort of like knowing the total caloric intake
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:56.440]   of your food, people go, wow,
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:58.160]   I'm actually eating a lot more than I thought.
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:01:59.000]   - It's calibration.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.960]   - Or less in some cases, but often the case is that it's more.
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:04.600]   So I think for the typical person,
[03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:07.000]   I'm wondering whether or not, like myself,
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.160]   'cause I'm not a competitive athlete
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:11.220]   or certainly not a professional athlete,
[03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:14.760]   competitive with myself, I suppose, but no one else.
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:19.000]   Morning pulse rate I tend to take when I'm waking.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.800]   If I wake out of a really stressful dream,
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.840]   I might relax a little bit
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:23.560]   and then just take my pulse rate, kind of get a range
[03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:25.960]   and see if it's spiking for whatever reason.
[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:27.480]   I don't tend to measure grip strength,
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:30.320]   although I've heard you can just use a classic scale,
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:33.320]   old fashioned scale with the Neo Now old fashioned
[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:35.160]   or some other more technical devices,
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:37.240]   probably there's a low cost one.
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:38.160]   - Yeah, they're all low.
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:40.280]   - And then the carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:42.920]   So we haven't really talked about that in specific ways.
[03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:46.640]   My understanding of it is it's four deep, slow breaths
[03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:48.240]   in through the nose, out through the nose,
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:50.840]   and then a big inhale as max exhale,
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:54.240]   and then time duration of exhale through the nose,
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:56.480]   and then stopping the stopwatch at the point
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:02:57.900]   where lungs are empty,
[03:02:57.900 --> 03:03:00.460]   not necessarily as long as one could hold their breath.
[03:03:00.460 --> 03:03:01.300]   Did I get that right?
[03:03:01.300 --> 03:03:02.120]   - Pretty much.
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:05.080]   I guess we should credit you and Brian McKenzie.
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:06.120]   - Yeah, those guys.
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:09.960]   - Yeah, and the folks under Brian's umbrella
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.680]   for really establishing this as a really good metric.
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:18.800]   When and how can I use the carbon dioxide tolerance test
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:20.360]   to gauge recovery?
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:25.040]   Upon waking, post training session?
[03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:25.880]   - Yeah.
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:26.700]   - Would that be a good time?
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:29.920]   - Number one answer is whatever you do, be consistent.
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:32.160]   So do it under any good science experiment.
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:34.820]   Do it under the exact same conditions as you can.
[03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:37.280]   That generally means somewhere in the morning,
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:38.280]   'cause that's when you're probably going to have
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:40.960]   the most control, most stability going.
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:45.500]   So yeah, like you would take any HRV or other metric,
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:49.000]   wake up, get under control, get stabilized,
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:50.040]   take your metric.
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:50.860]   - Got it.
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:51.700]   - Gonna be pretty good.
[03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:53.000]   - Got it.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.380]   Sodium bicarb, baking soda.
[03:03:55.380 --> 03:03:58.940]   Rumor has it, and data has it,
[03:03:58.940 --> 03:04:02.560]   that it can actually be a pretty effective training tool.
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:03.400]   - Very effective.
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:06.440]   - Could you explain a little bit about how it works
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:09.380]   and how one might explore using sodium bicarb
[03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:11.920]   to enhance training output in a couple of different contexts?
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:14.440]   - Yeah, so there's a handful of these
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:18.460]   ubiquitously effective supplements for performance.
[03:04:18.460 --> 03:04:19.660]   Sodium bicarb is one of them.
[03:04:19.660 --> 03:04:24.660]   It's a very ingenious idea 'cause it's so simple.
[03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:28.400]   Effectively, muscle contraction happens
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:30.560]   because enzymatic function occurs
[03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:33.000]   within a fairly specific pH range, right?
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000]   So if it gets extremely acidic, it doesn't like it.
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.980]   And so whether you're running through aerobic glycolysis
[03:04:37.980 --> 03:04:39.360]   or anaerobic or anything else,
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:40.480]   all of these things require,
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:43.400]   even ATP hydrolysis requires ATPase.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:44.360]   An enzyme has to do it.
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:45.540]   Enzymes don't function well
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:49.160]   outside of this fairly special range.
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:51.320]   So what happens is generally fatigue,
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:54.800]   the sensations of fatigue are actually caused
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:57.920]   by some signal that, hey, we're starting to run out of pH
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:59.160]   or we're getting in the wrong range.
[03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:01.120]   You're not out of gas usually.
[03:05:01.120 --> 03:05:02.880]   You're not too low on oxygen.
[03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:04.680]   You're not running low on muscle glycogen yet.
[03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:08.600]   You're typically gonna see signs or feel signals of fatigue
[03:05:08.600 --> 03:05:11.420]   way prior to that, mostly being pH issues.
[03:05:11.420 --> 03:05:14.960]   That being said, what if we could regulate pH better?
[03:05:14.960 --> 03:05:17.140]   Enter bicarbonate, right?
[03:05:17.140 --> 03:05:20.240]   So without going too far into metabolism,
[03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:22.540]   effectively what happens is you take an inhale
[03:05:22.540 --> 03:05:24.900]   and you're mostly breathing in oxygen, O2.
[03:05:26.100 --> 03:05:28.140]   When you exhale, you're breathing out CO2.
[03:05:28.140 --> 03:05:31.060]   So the difference is you've gained a carbon somehow.
[03:05:31.060 --> 03:05:34.020]   Well, all of your carbohydrates in your body
[03:05:34.020 --> 03:05:36.120]   come in the form of long carbon chains.
[03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:37.920]   In fact, that's what a carbohydrate means.
[03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:39.200]   It is a one-carbon molecule
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:40.760]   that has one water molecule attached to it.
[03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:42.920]   It's a carbon that has been hydrated.
[03:05:42.920 --> 03:05:45.280]   In the case of like glucose, blood sugar,
[03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:47.320]   it's a six-carbon molecule, right?
[03:05:47.320 --> 03:05:49.760]   In terms of fat, which are the only two places
[03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:51.440]   you're gonna get most of your cellular energy,
[03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:52.920]   carbohydrates and fat,
[03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:56.300]   that is also a big, long block and chain of carbons.
[03:05:56.300 --> 03:05:57.340]   So whether you're getting your energy
[03:05:57.340 --> 03:05:59.860]   from fat or carbohydrate,
[03:05:59.860 --> 03:06:03.220]   you're going to split those atoms.
[03:06:03.220 --> 03:06:05.100]   So in other words, you've got six carbons
[03:06:05.100 --> 03:06:06.420]   attached to each other.
[03:06:06.420 --> 03:06:09.020]   And in this part of chemistry, it's exergonic.
[03:06:09.020 --> 03:06:10.740]   So when you break that carbon bond,
[03:06:10.740 --> 03:06:13.660]   so break one of those carbons off from the other,
[03:06:13.660 --> 03:06:14.980]   that's going to release energy.
[03:06:14.980 --> 03:06:17.660]   Just like if you had a pencil in here and I snapped it,
[03:06:17.660 --> 03:06:19.660]   you'd go bang and pop.
[03:06:19.660 --> 03:06:22.340]   I broke the bonds that were connecting that graphite
[03:06:22.340 --> 03:06:24.640]   to the next piece of graphite and that released energy
[03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:27.260]   'cause I put energy into the system, et cetera.
[03:06:27.260 --> 03:06:28.340]   Okay.
[03:06:28.340 --> 03:06:30.820]   As a result though, we've now had, you know,
[03:06:30.820 --> 03:06:32.580]   say five or six carbons chained together.
[03:06:32.580 --> 03:06:34.900]   We broke one off the end, which is not how it works,
[03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:36.860]   but making the point.
[03:06:36.860 --> 03:06:38.840]   And now you have one free-floating carbon.
[03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:41.780]   You use that energy release to then go make ATP,
[03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:44.320]   to then go make your muscles contract.
[03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:46.840]   But now you've got carbon floating around.
[03:06:46.840 --> 03:06:50.200]   You can associate free-floating carbon
[03:06:50.200 --> 03:06:52.200]   with being at a higher acidic level.
[03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:54.340]   It's not going to happen.
[03:06:54.340 --> 03:06:55.840]   The only way that you're going to go through this process
[03:06:55.840 --> 03:06:56.680]   is if your body says,
[03:06:56.680 --> 03:06:58.320]   do we have an oxygen molecule available
[03:06:58.320 --> 03:07:00.760]   that we can bind this to immediately?
[03:07:00.760 --> 03:07:02.040]   Yes, we do.
[03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:04.080]   That carbon attaches to that oxygen molecule.
[03:07:04.080 --> 03:07:05.680]   You can't just put CO2 in the blood
[03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:07.280]   because of what we just talked about.
[03:07:07.280 --> 03:07:09.480]   So you're going to bind it through this bicarbonate process.
[03:07:09.480 --> 03:07:10.760]   It's going to go through your blood.
[03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:12.120]   It's going to go into the lungs.
[03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:14.320]   It's going to go back into its carbon dioxide molecule.
[03:07:14.320 --> 03:07:16.920]   It's going to trans, go through the alveoli into the lungs
[03:07:16.920 --> 03:07:18.100]   and you're going to exhale.
[03:07:18.100 --> 03:07:21.500]   So you went from carbon to this bicarbonate system,
[03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:22.740]   back into carbon, exhale.
[03:07:22.740 --> 03:07:25.700]   So inhaled O2 plants go the opposite, by the way.
[03:07:25.700 --> 03:07:27.200]   So they're going to breathe in the CO2.
[03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:28.660]   They're going to cleave off that carbon,
[03:07:28.660 --> 03:07:32.120]   stack those carbons together and that's how they get larger.
[03:07:32.120 --> 03:07:35.980]   In your blood, those six carbon chains are called glucose.
[03:07:35.980 --> 03:07:38.420]   If we store that in your muscle, we call it glycogen.
[03:07:38.420 --> 03:07:40.820]   So we take a bunch of glucose and stack it together.
[03:07:40.820 --> 03:07:43.380]   In a plant, we call that starch.
[03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:45.500]   That's effectively what it is, right?
[03:07:45.500 --> 03:07:47.020]   So you took a bunch of carbon from the atmosphere,
[03:07:47.020 --> 03:07:49.220]   stuck it all together and that's a starch.
[03:07:49.220 --> 03:07:51.060]   If you want to do it in the form of fruit,
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:53.400]   we take that starch, like from the ground,
[03:07:53.400 --> 03:07:56.180]   you put it up through the tree,
[03:07:56.180 --> 03:07:58.020]   go all the way up to the top, put it into the flower,
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:08:01.300]   break it up into these big, huge chunks of starch
[03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:03.920]   into little forms called fructose or glucose.
[03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:05.460]   That's why fruit has fructose in it
[03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:08.960]   and that's why tubers and stuff have starch in them.
[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:11.700]   Basically starch in an animal is glycogen in us.
[03:08:11.700 --> 03:08:15.020]   Okay, all that to say, if that's happening
[03:08:15.020 --> 03:08:16.180]   and we know that a by-product,
[03:08:16.180 --> 03:08:17.980]   specifically of anaerobic glycolysis,
[03:08:17.980 --> 03:08:21.020]   meaning the breakdown of carbohydrates for fuel,
[03:08:21.020 --> 03:08:23.980]   typically in a very fast pace
[03:08:23.980 --> 03:08:25.720]   with low oxygen availability,
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:29.480]   the downside of that equation is acid production.
[03:08:29.480 --> 03:08:32.460]   We know that that's a problem
[03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:34.720]   'cause I started the conversation up there intentionally.
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:37.140]   So what if we could reduce the acid buildup?
[03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:38.940]   Now, you know how pH kind of works?
[03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:40.900]   I went in kind of double negatives there, right?
[03:08:40.900 --> 03:08:43.420]   You don't want too much acid buildup.
[03:08:43.420 --> 03:08:46.500]   Then could we prolong and sustain energy
[03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:47.340]   in a more effective pace,
[03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:50.640]   especially in this anaerobic interval kind of environment?
[03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:52.700]   And again, that's important because in those things,
[03:08:52.700 --> 03:08:57.060]   failure is not a result of running out of fuel or oxygen.
[03:08:57.060 --> 03:08:59.820]   It's a result of fatigue building up way too quickly.
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:01.980]   - Is that also true for resistance training?
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:06.840]   There's maybe more of the creatine phosphate system.
[03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:07.940]   - That can be an issue.
[03:09:07.940 --> 03:09:09.880]   It could simply be an issue of force production.
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:11.340]   You just don't have enough force.
[03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:12.380]   At least you're not out of energy.
[03:09:12.380 --> 03:09:15.560]   You just can't muster enough force.
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:18.620]   You do enough reps, then it's gonna be an issue there.
[03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:21.260]   Creatine phosphate would be the big winner, depending.
[03:09:21.260 --> 03:09:25.540]   So to come back a little bit to the beginning,
[03:09:25.540 --> 03:09:28.540]   and then I'm circling this all together intentionally.
[03:09:28.540 --> 03:09:32.980]   All right, well, the way that we produce energy
[03:09:32.980 --> 03:09:34.780]   is gonna be in two primary categories,
[03:09:34.780 --> 03:09:36.020]   anaerobic and aerobic.
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:39.340]   Aerobic meaning with oxygen, anaerobic meaning without.
[03:09:39.340 --> 03:09:40.620]   In terms of muscle contraction,
[03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:43.580]   you're pretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat.
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:46.620]   Now, fat is going to be exclusively aerobic,
[03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:49.900]   meaning I'm gonna use fat from the entire body,
[03:09:49.900 --> 03:09:50.740]   roughly equally.
[03:09:50.740 --> 03:09:52.700]   So you're doing a sprint up a hill,
[03:09:52.700 --> 03:09:55.740]   and your hamstrings or your glutes or your quads are on fire.
[03:09:55.740 --> 03:09:57.860]   You can't, you're not just going to use the fat
[03:09:57.860 --> 03:09:59.300]   that's directly in those hamstrings.
[03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:01.220]   You're gonna lose it from the entire body.
[03:10:01.220 --> 03:10:02.420]   It has to go through lipolysis,
[03:10:02.420 --> 03:10:05.100]   so it's in this stored form in adipose tissue.
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:06.820]   It's gotta get broken down, put into blood.
[03:10:06.820 --> 03:10:08.460]   Blood's gonna have to go through your body,
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:09.580]   get taken up into muscle,
[03:10:09.580 --> 03:10:11.740]   taken up through muscle into the mitochondria.
[03:10:11.740 --> 03:10:14.060]   Then we're gonna have to go through this process
[03:10:14.060 --> 03:10:15.380]   called beta-oxidation.
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:17.980]   So remember, carbohydrates and glucose,
[03:10:17.980 --> 03:10:19.820]   especially, is a six-carbon molecule.
[03:10:19.820 --> 03:10:23.300]   Fat, if it's in the form of a triglyceride,
[03:10:23.300 --> 03:10:25.260]   it is a three-carbon glycerol backbone,
[03:10:25.260 --> 03:10:29.140]   and three, you know, try one, two, three, fatty acids.
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:31.100]   Three-carbon backbone, and those fatty acids
[03:10:31.100 --> 03:10:32.860]   are just big, long chains of carbon.
[03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:35.260]   That's all it is, right?
[03:10:35.260 --> 03:10:38.060]   So we're gonna break that thing down, put it in the blood,
[03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:39.780]   move it up, move it into our mitochondria.
[03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:42.260]   You can't walk those things across the mitochondria wall.
[03:10:42.260 --> 03:10:43.460]   They're too big.
[03:10:43.460 --> 03:10:45.260]   So what you have to do is cleave them off
[03:10:45.260 --> 03:10:46.820]   into little chunks,
[03:10:46.820 --> 03:10:49.260]   and it turns out we break them off into two carbon chunks.
[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:51.660]   We call it beta, as in two.
[03:10:51.660 --> 03:10:52.900]   Move those into mitochondria.
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:55.180]   That can go through this little thing called Krebs cycle
[03:10:55.180 --> 03:10:56.980]   or triaxialic acid cycle,
[03:10:56.980 --> 03:10:59.520]   and you kick out a bunch of energy out of that.
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:02.020]   You add two carbons, so as a result of that process,
[03:11:02.020 --> 03:11:04.700]   you're gonna generate two carbon dioxides.
[03:11:04.700 --> 03:11:06.820]   But remember, you can only go through that process
[03:11:06.820 --> 03:11:08.600]   if oxygen is available because you have to be able
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:10.900]   to place those carbons onto something,
[03:11:10.900 --> 03:11:13.280]   or acid gets up way too high too fast.
[03:11:13.280 --> 03:11:16.380]   This is one of the reasons why fat is a nice fuel source,
[03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:18.020]   but it's very slow.
[03:11:18.020 --> 03:11:20.360]   It takes physical time to move from the back
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:23.140]   of your shoulder into your blood, down your hamstring,
[03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:24.580]   uptake, uptake, uptake.
[03:11:24.580 --> 03:11:28.340]   In addition, it's required oxygen availability.
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:30.780]   If you need energy faster, you simply don't have the time
[03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:32.600]   to bring in the oxygen, transport it through,
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:36.380]   go through capillaries, exchange through a tissue, et cetera.
[03:11:36.380 --> 03:11:38.020]   Carbohydrate, on the other hand,
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:42.100]   is gonna be stored locally in the exercising muscle cell,
[03:11:42.100 --> 03:11:44.060]   and specifically in the cytoplasm.
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:45.140]   - As glycogen.
[03:11:45.140 --> 03:11:47.700]   - As glycogen in the store there.
[03:11:47.700 --> 03:11:48.900]   So what's gonna happen initially,
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:51.560]   your initial demands for fuel are gonna come
[03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:54.200]   from the glycogen stored within the muscle fiber itself.
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:55.780]   It's just gonna break right there,
[03:11:55.780 --> 03:11:56.820]   and you're gonna be off the races.
[03:11:56.820 --> 03:11:58.060]   So you have the six carbon molecules,
[03:11:58.060 --> 03:11:59.220]   you're gonna break it into two separate
[03:11:59.220 --> 03:12:00.980]   three carbon molecules.
[03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:04.480]   Okay, boom, that breaking provides you a tiny bit of energy,
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:06.640]   very small, but some.
[03:12:06.640 --> 03:12:08.880]   Now you're gonna take those two three carbon molecules,
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:10.940]   and you wanna be able to oxidize them,
[03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:12.320]   'cause that's your only next step.
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:13.200]   But in order to do that,
[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:15.020]   you gotta go those into mitochondria.
[03:12:15.020 --> 03:12:19.120]   So you gotta break one of those molecules off,
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:21.140]   so then you'll be back to your two carbon molecule,
[03:12:21.140 --> 03:12:22.180]   just like you did with fat,
[03:12:22.180 --> 03:12:23.820]   that's gonna go into mitochondria,
[03:12:23.820 --> 03:12:26.360]   and then it's gonna go through the exact same Krebs cycle,
[03:12:26.360 --> 03:12:27.680]   two carbons, et cetera.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:31.480]   But hold on, if you don't have sufficient oxygen,
[03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:34.180]   or sufficient mitochondrial availability,
[03:12:34.180 --> 03:12:37.100]   and you're stuck at that two three carbon place,
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:38.440]   what the do you do?
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:41.380]   You have problems, right?
[03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:44.200]   Now we have to say, okay, wait a minute.
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:46.940]   We have a three carbon molecule,
[03:12:46.940 --> 03:12:48.540]   and we have a bunch of this acid buildup.
[03:12:48.540 --> 03:12:51.180]   Now acid functionally is hydrogen.
[03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:52.740]   That's what pH, potential hydrogen,
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:54.820]   is what pH stands for, right?
[03:12:54.820 --> 03:12:57.880]   So if hydrogen is building up as a byproduct
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:12:58.980]   of muscular contraction,
[03:12:58.980 --> 03:13:00.700]   and then you're having this three carbon molecule,
[03:13:00.700 --> 03:13:04.300]   what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogens.
[03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:05.660]   And those three carbon molecules, by the way,
[03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:08.260]   are called peruvic acid, right?
[03:13:08.260 --> 03:13:10.860]   If you take a peruvic acid and you grab hydrogen,
[03:13:10.860 --> 03:13:13.640]   put it on top of it, we now have a different name for it.
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:14.480]   It's called?
[03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:15.300]   - Hydrogen peroxide.
[03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:17.880]   - Lactate, bingo, right?
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:21.020]   That's what lactate or lactic acid is, right?
[03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:21.860]   So we've now built that up.
[03:13:21.860 --> 03:13:25.420]   So number one reason why lactate's not causing your fatigue
[03:13:25.420 --> 03:13:26.620]   is actually preventing it,
[03:13:26.620 --> 03:13:28.960]   and that it does a bunch of other really cool stuff.
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:32.460]   But the point is that system can only last so long.
[03:13:32.460 --> 03:13:34.920]   That gets overwhelmed very quickly.
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:37.660]   What are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen?
[03:13:37.660 --> 03:13:40.820]   Well, if you started off in a normal pH range,
[03:13:40.820 --> 03:13:42.280]   you don't have very far to go
[03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:45.780]   before you've now gone into that level of too much acidity.
[03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:47.620]   If you start off in a more basic,
[03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:48.860]   and basic, I don't mean simple,
[03:13:48.860 --> 03:13:51.460]   I mean chemistry, right, and more alkaline,
[03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:54.540]   then that same amount of increase in pH is no longer,
[03:13:54.540 --> 03:13:56.440]   now it just puts you back in your physiological range.
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:59.340]   So sodium bicarbonate, whether taken as a cream,
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:01.860]   or a powder, or baking soda, or anything else,
[03:14:01.860 --> 03:14:04.860]   can simply put you in a more alkaline state even acutely.
[03:14:04.860 --> 03:14:06.300]   So this is something you can take right now
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:07.640]   before your workout.
[03:14:07.640 --> 03:14:09.980]   You're going to delay,
[03:14:09.980 --> 03:14:11.820]   what we call delay the progression of fatigue.
[03:14:11.820 --> 03:14:15.540]   - And how would people start to approach this practice?
[03:14:15.540 --> 03:14:17.140]   My understanding is you can do this
[03:14:17.140 --> 03:14:19.860]   with common store-bought baking soda.
[03:14:19.860 --> 03:14:21.260]   - No question.
[03:14:21.260 --> 03:14:24.260]   - There's always a concern about gastric distress,
[03:14:24.260 --> 03:14:26.380]   that it's a very effective laxative,
[03:14:26.380 --> 03:14:30.040]   sometimes an unwanted laxative effect.
[03:14:30.040 --> 03:14:32.540]   But how would one approach this before?
[03:14:32.540 --> 03:14:35.040]   Let's say I'm going to,
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:40.000]   I'm doing the mile repeats exercise,
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.980]   mile repeats protocol that we talked about earlier.
[03:14:42.980 --> 03:14:44.120]   I'm doing that for a few months,
[03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:46.720]   and now I want to try the sodium bicarb approach.
[03:14:46.720 --> 03:14:49.060]   I'm well hydrated, hopefully I'm well rested.
[03:14:49.060 --> 03:14:50.900]   I'm ready to go.
[03:14:50.900 --> 03:14:54.680]   When am I going to drink this sodium bicarb solution?
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:56.420]   How would I make the solution?
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:14:58.600]   Let's say I take 10 ounces of water.
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:00.940]   How much bicarb do I want to,
[03:15:00.940 --> 03:15:02.300]   sodium bicarb should I put in there?
[03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:03.280]   Can we come up with it?
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:04.360]   Is it half a teaspoon?
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:05.900]   Is it a teaspoon?
[03:15:05.900 --> 03:15:07.740]   - Here's what I'm going to tell you.
[03:15:07.740 --> 03:15:10.120]   You will thank me by starting lower.
[03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:11.260]   You can always go more later.
[03:15:11.260 --> 03:15:12.220]   - So a little pinch.
[03:15:12.220 --> 03:15:13.140]   - You cannot go backwards.
[03:15:13.140 --> 03:15:14.820]   - How about I start with a quarter teaspoon?
[03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:16.460]   - Fine, honestly, half is fine.
[03:15:16.460 --> 03:15:17.580]   - Half a teaspoon. - Totally fine.
[03:15:17.580 --> 03:15:19.820]   - Dissolve that, slug that down.
[03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:21.460]   I read a study recently that showed
[03:15:21.460 --> 03:15:25.040]   that people will hit their, the peak benefits of this
[03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:27.000]   at different times, but it's somewhere,
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.080]   if memory serves me correctly,
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:30.980]   somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes later.
[03:15:30.980 --> 03:15:32.680]   So I might want to drink it on the way to the track.
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:34.380]   - It can, it can be as low as 20.
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:37.360]   - Okay, so maybe as I get to the tracks
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:38.540]   since I'm going to do some warm up
[03:15:38.540 --> 03:15:39.740]   with some walking, jogging.
[03:15:39.740 --> 03:15:40.860]   - I say 45 minutes.
[03:15:40.860 --> 03:15:41.700]   - Okay.
[03:15:41.700 --> 03:15:42.920]   - That's just a very rough standard.
[03:15:42.920 --> 03:15:45.360]   But yeah, you're right, it is individualized.
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:47.320]   And you probably want to play with that a little bit.
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:49.700]   If not, just somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to an hour.
[03:15:49.700 --> 03:15:54.600]   - Okay, and then the perceived and real fatigue,
[03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:56.400]   if done correctly,
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:58.820]   the perceived and real fatigue ought to be reduced.
[03:15:58.820 --> 03:15:59.660]   - Yes.
[03:15:59.660 --> 03:16:02.100]   - I can do more work without feeling exhausted.
[03:16:02.100 --> 03:16:04.500]   Will I feel less of a lactate burn?
[03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:05.340]   - Yep.
[03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:06.280]   - Done in air quotes for those listening,
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:07.500]   I realize that's a very crude way
[03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:09.980]   to describe a complex physiological process.
[03:16:09.980 --> 03:16:11.380]   - Yep.
[03:16:11.380 --> 03:16:15.340]   - Fantastic, can sodium bicarb be used repeatedly
[03:16:15.340 --> 03:16:17.980]   for longer duration training?
[03:16:17.980 --> 03:16:18.820]   - Yep.
[03:16:18.820 --> 03:16:21.660]   - And we're going to use it with weight training
[03:16:21.660 --> 03:16:22.500]   for whatever reason.
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:24.060]   Maybe I'm doing circuit type training
[03:16:24.060 --> 03:16:26.000]   or I'm doing the superset type strength training
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:27.940]   that you talked about before, push, pull, push, pull,
[03:16:27.940 --> 03:16:30.660]   where it's a little bit more cardiovascularly demanding.
[03:16:30.660 --> 03:16:32.080]   - Yep.
[03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:33.760]   - Then maybe I'd sip that throughout the workout,
[03:16:33.760 --> 03:16:35.740]   make sure there's a bathroom nearby, it sounds like.
[03:16:35.740 --> 03:16:37.940]   'Cause I am aware that many people
[03:16:37.940 --> 03:16:39.620]   get pretty serious gastric distress.
[03:16:39.620 --> 03:16:40.580]   - It can happen very quickly.
[03:16:40.580 --> 03:16:41.860]   - Okay, great.
[03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:44.260]   Well, it sounds like an amazing training tool.
[03:16:44.260 --> 03:16:45.220]   I really appreciate you sharing it.
[03:16:45.220 --> 03:16:47.320]   'Cause I think it's one that doesn't get
[03:16:47.320 --> 03:16:48.660]   a lot of air time these days,
[03:16:48.660 --> 03:16:49.580]   'cause it's been around,
[03:16:49.580 --> 03:16:52.220]   but it sounds like it has some pretty impressive effects.
[03:16:52.220 --> 03:16:54.900]   - Yeah, you know what's sort of funny about that is,
[03:16:54.900 --> 03:16:56.620]   I mean, I get it, pop culture is what it is,
[03:16:56.620 --> 03:16:57.900]   but still to this day,
[03:16:57.900 --> 03:16:59.980]   if you want to talk about sort of your most effective
[03:16:59.980 --> 03:17:02.660]   general health/performance supplementation,
[03:17:02.660 --> 03:17:04.700]   it's the same three to four to five.
[03:17:04.700 --> 03:17:07.420]   It's because they work really well.
[03:17:07.420 --> 03:17:09.540]   - Without going into the chemistry of each one
[03:17:09.540 --> 03:17:10.420]   and the practice of each one,
[03:17:10.420 --> 03:17:11.960]   'cause I definitely want to get you back
[03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:16.660]   to talk about nutrition and supplementation at some point.
[03:17:16.660 --> 03:17:18.840]   But I think we need a full couple of hours
[03:17:18.840 --> 03:17:20.720]   to get that right, at least.
[03:17:20.720 --> 03:17:24.120]   If you, as a teaser,
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:27.060]   would you mind just listing off the other supplements
[03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:30.620]   that you have found are very effective for many people?
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:32.820]   So sodium bicarb or baking soda is one.
[03:17:32.820 --> 03:17:33.820]   What are some of the other ones?
[03:17:33.820 --> 03:17:35.320]   - Yep, and we'll go kind of in reverse order.
[03:17:35.320 --> 03:17:39.040]   Beta alanine is another very classically effective one.
[03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:42.020]   Similar idea of sodium bicarbon.
[03:17:42.020 --> 03:17:44.820]   So it's going to, beta alanine is going to come in,
[03:17:44.820 --> 03:17:46.140]   it's going to be converted and stored
[03:17:46.140 --> 03:17:47.740]   as what's called carnosine in the muscle.
[03:17:47.740 --> 03:17:49.500]   And carnosine is an intracellular buffer.
[03:17:49.500 --> 03:17:50.340]   So in other words,
[03:17:50.340 --> 03:17:53.180]   it's just going to delay the buildup of acid.
[03:17:53.180 --> 03:17:54.980]   So fatigue blocker, if you will.
[03:17:54.980 --> 03:17:58.800]   So very effective, very cheap, very safe, well studied.
[03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:01.820]   The top one, though, of all of them by far
[03:18:01.820 --> 03:18:05.260]   that has an incredibly strong safety profile,
[03:18:05.260 --> 03:18:09.040]   it has, it is a cheap, it is a simple form to get,
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:12.960]   has a important magnitude of effect,
[03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:15.740]   and is effective across multiple domains
[03:18:15.740 --> 03:18:16.860]   of physical health and performance.
[03:18:16.860 --> 03:18:19.860]   And it is, because of that, it is my crown jewel.
[03:18:19.860 --> 03:18:22.260]   It is, in my opinion, without question,
[03:18:22.260 --> 03:18:24.820]   the Michael Jordan of all supplementation.
[03:18:24.820 --> 03:18:26.740]   And that's creatine monohydrate.
[03:18:26.740 --> 03:18:28.180]   It affects so many things.
[03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:30.940]   We typically think about it as it's muscle stuff, right?
[03:18:30.940 --> 03:18:32.420]   You've talked kind of, you quickly were talking
[03:18:32.420 --> 03:18:34.420]   about the creatine phosphate system.
[03:18:34.420 --> 03:18:37.460]   But we have to realize the mass majority of research
[03:18:37.460 --> 03:18:39.420]   on creatine phosphate is not in sport performance
[03:18:39.420 --> 03:18:41.160]   and has not been for 20 years.
[03:18:41.160 --> 03:18:42.500]   It's in clinical.
[03:18:42.500 --> 03:18:47.060]   And it has everything from effects on the neurological system
[03:18:47.060 --> 03:18:48.240]   to there have been associations
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:50.100]   to mental health and depression.
[03:18:50.100 --> 03:18:52.320]   And to be very clear, I am certainly not saying
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:55.560]   you can take creatine and cure anything.
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:56.820]   And I'm not saying it's going to stop you
[03:18:56.820 --> 03:18:58.060]   from depression or anything,
[03:18:58.060 --> 03:19:01.060]   but I'm saying there's a lot of research in these areas
[03:19:01.060 --> 03:19:02.820]   and there's a reason people are doing it.
[03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:04.140]   - Yeah, I completely agree.
[03:19:04.140 --> 03:19:06.040]   And if you're willing, I'd love to have you back
[03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:09.320]   for us to do a discussion on creatine and the brain
[03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:10.980]   or creatine and the nervous system.
[03:19:10.980 --> 03:19:12.700]   That would be a lot of fun and maybe we can do
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:14.660]   a kind of a journal club in advance of that.
[03:19:14.660 --> 03:19:17.020]   For those that don't know, a journal club is where
[03:19:17.020 --> 03:19:20.140]   scientists read a bunch of papers and then argue about them,
[03:19:20.140 --> 03:19:22.580]   discuss them and try and extract the kind of
[03:19:22.580 --> 03:19:26.540]   agreed upon center of mass, if you will.
[03:19:26.540 --> 03:19:29.400]   I think I've long been taking five grams
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:31.420]   of creatine monohydrate per day
[03:19:31.420 --> 03:19:33.020]   mainly for the cognitive effects.
[03:19:33.020 --> 03:19:37.420]   I sense an effect, that's obviously anec data,
[03:19:37.420 --> 03:19:39.620]   but I think there are a lot of data out there as you-
[03:19:39.620 --> 03:19:41.460]   - There's enough, you're not crazy.
[03:19:41.460 --> 03:19:44.460]   There's enough there and in fact there's enough mechanism
[03:19:44.460 --> 03:19:47.760]   now to understand the metabolic needs.
[03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:49.740]   People think the, I'm a muscle guy, right?
[03:19:49.740 --> 03:19:51.520]   So I'm going to think about the metabolism needed
[03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:55.180]   to fuel muscle, but we forget cells, immune cells,
[03:19:55.180 --> 03:19:58.240]   red blood cells, nerve cells, astrocytes, brain,
[03:19:58.240 --> 03:19:59.880]   all this stuff requires energy
[03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:02.620]   and it's all going through metabolism.
[03:20:02.620 --> 03:20:03.540]   - Super interesting.
[03:20:03.540 --> 03:20:06.600]   We will do the deep dive on that soon.
[03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:09.660]   I have a final question for you.
[03:20:09.660 --> 03:20:11.640]   You're involved in a really interesting,
[03:20:11.640 --> 03:20:13.900]   I think really cutting edge project
[03:20:13.900 --> 03:20:16.060]   that I first learned about from you.
[03:20:16.060 --> 03:20:18.400]   I don't know of anyone else doing anything
[03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:21.140]   as forward thinking and frankly,
[03:20:21.140 --> 03:20:24.840]   as relevant to the general population
[03:20:24.840 --> 03:20:27.780]   because of my interest in people getting better sleep
[03:20:27.780 --> 03:20:28.900]   and learning how to do that,
[03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:30.840]   avoiding stress and learning how to do that.
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:33.820]   Tell us a little bit about what I believe
[03:20:33.820 --> 03:20:35.740]   is called absolute rest.
[03:20:35.740 --> 03:20:36.580]   - Right.
[03:20:36.580 --> 03:20:38.080]   So this is something that we've been playing with
[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:40.820]   behind the scenes for a long time.
[03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:42.920]   And this is typically how high performance stuff works,
[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:43.760]   right?
[03:20:43.760 --> 03:20:46.500]   People want exclusivity and so this has been built.
[03:20:46.500 --> 03:20:48.940]   Effectively what happened is a friend of mine,
[03:20:48.940 --> 03:20:50.600]   Cody Burkhardt, I don't know if you know Cody,
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:20:51.440]   but a famous--
[03:20:51.440 --> 03:20:52.580]   - Down in Texas.
[03:20:52.580 --> 03:20:53.640]   - Yeah, NASA.
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:54.480]   - NASA guy.
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:55.640]   Yeah, I do know Cody.
[03:20:55.640 --> 03:20:58.640]   - Wonderful, just down the road thinker.
[03:20:58.640 --> 03:21:01.480]   Everyone's interested in sleep, right?
[03:21:01.480 --> 03:21:04.800]   And for forever, I would cover using with athletes,
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:08.380]   but everything available tells you how you're sleeping.
[03:21:08.380 --> 03:21:12.280]   Nothing can tell you why you're sleeping that way.
[03:21:12.280 --> 03:21:15.000]   And so we got together in Boulder
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:16.840]   and then I met some of his former colleagues,
[03:21:16.840 --> 03:21:20.720]   computer science folks, Harvard MD,
[03:21:20.720 --> 03:21:23.480]   and some really impressive tech folks.
[03:21:23.480 --> 03:21:25.120]   And we were just thinking about an idea
[03:21:25.120 --> 03:21:28.300]   and we came up with, we started to realize the problems,
[03:21:28.300 --> 03:21:29.140]   right?
[03:21:29.140 --> 03:21:29.960]   We use first principle thinking.
[03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:31.500]   It's one of my favorite approaches.
[03:21:31.500 --> 03:21:33.600]   If you're not familiar with that, go Google that.
[03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:35.800]   Like that's just a recipe to solve problems,
[03:21:35.800 --> 03:21:37.480]   this first principle thinking.
[03:21:37.480 --> 03:21:38.740]   And we just started to think about like,
[03:21:38.740 --> 03:21:40.600]   man, all the sleep tech is there, it's real.
[03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:43.560]   I don't need to convince people that they need sleep.
[03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:44.600]   Everyone's done that.
[03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:46.720]   You need high quality sleep,
[03:21:46.720 --> 03:21:48.540]   but how can I provide solutions?
[03:21:48.540 --> 03:21:50.480]   And with the people I work with,
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:53.040]   I can't just tell them your testosterone's down
[03:21:53.040 --> 03:21:54.120]   or your sleep's down or recover.
[03:21:54.120 --> 03:21:56.560]   I need to be able to be like, this is down and here's why
[03:21:56.560 --> 03:21:57.680]   and here's our solution.
[03:21:57.680 --> 03:21:59.840]   That's how our high performance world works.
[03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:01.700]   So enter absolute rest.
[03:22:01.700 --> 03:22:03.500]   This is saying, okay, what are the actual nodes
[03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:07.400]   that go into high effective, high quality sleep?
[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:08.940]   Number one is psychology.
[03:22:08.940 --> 03:22:11.180]   So there has to be some sort of screening diagnostic
[03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:12.980]   for are you not sleeping because of simply
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:13.860]   you can't control yourself?
[03:22:13.860 --> 03:22:17.040]   And you've done a wonderful job of giving people tools
[03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:19.660]   or if you can't quiet your mind before sleep, do this.
[03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:21.260]   If you wake up and you can't go back to sleep,
[03:22:21.260 --> 03:22:22.800]   here are a bunch of things, right?
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:24.140]   So we have some screens that we can do
[03:22:24.140 --> 03:22:26.320]   and there's some other stuff we can do to analyze.
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:27.560]   This is a psychological issue.
[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:29.240]   Let's say it's not.
[03:22:29.240 --> 03:22:31.660]   You're under control and we have different tricks we use
[03:22:31.660 --> 03:22:36.320]   and stuff on gymnastics we talk about, but it's not that.
[03:22:36.320 --> 03:22:38.040]   Okay, is it physiology?
[03:22:38.040 --> 03:22:39.600]   Which is node number two.
[03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:41.160]   Do we know what your dopamine levels are like?
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:42.680]   Do we know what your serotonin levels are like?
[03:22:42.680 --> 03:22:43.800]   What's melatonin look like?
[03:22:43.800 --> 03:22:45.060]   What's this, what's adrenaline?
[03:22:45.060 --> 03:22:45.900]   What's cortisol?
[03:22:45.900 --> 03:22:47.500]   Cortisol being the primary driver.
[03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:50.120]   What is this relationship DHEA?
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:51.040]   Where are these things at?
[03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:53.600]   So we're gonna measure all that and track that.
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:55.800]   We're gonna measure that during the day prior to sleep.
[03:22:55.800 --> 03:22:56.800]   We're gonna measure that next morning
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:22:59.520]   and even sometimes throughout sleep.
[03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:01.280]   And we're gonna figure out, is this a physiology problem?
[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:03.160]   If it is, then we have clear corrections.
[03:23:03.160 --> 03:23:04.800]   If not, we're gonna go on to the next step,
[03:23:04.800 --> 03:23:08.040]   which is, is this possibly a pathology?
[03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:09.940]   So you have some sort of sleep disorder.
[03:23:09.940 --> 03:23:11.660]   We're gonna run full, what's called PSG,
[03:23:11.660 --> 03:23:14.380]   so polysomnography, the exact same stuff you would get
[03:23:14.380 --> 03:23:16.160]   in a sleep clinic.
[03:23:16.160 --> 03:23:17.600]   It's a sensor that's gonna go on there
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:19.040]   measuring EEG and EOG.
[03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:21.140]   And we're gonna have muscle activation sensor
[03:23:21.140 --> 03:23:22.440]   to see if your legs are moving
[03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:23.840]   and everything else is going on.
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:25.120]   And we're gonna get a full diagnostic.
[03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:27.600]   And if anyone's ever done this,
[03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:30.380]   the amount of sleep issues that are happening in people
[03:23:30.380 --> 03:23:33.360]   that they don't even realize is extraordinarily high.
[03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:34.880]   So we're gonna figure this out.
[03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:35.960]   One very quick example,
[03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:38.280]   we just did this with a professional athlete
[03:23:38.280 --> 03:23:40.480]   and he was having like 280,
[03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:42.520]   roughly, of these episodes per night.
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:44.120]   And to be categorized as an episode,
[03:23:44.120 --> 03:23:46.800]   you have to meet these four specific criteria,
[03:23:46.800 --> 03:23:49.080]   oxygen saturation, ventilation changes,
[03:23:49.080 --> 03:23:50.440]   brain changes, et cetera.
[03:23:50.440 --> 03:23:53.440]   And he hit that over 280 times a night.
[03:23:53.440 --> 03:23:54.920]   And what this technology allowed us to do
[03:23:54.920 --> 03:23:57.940]   is figure out what position did all these things occur in.
[03:23:57.940 --> 03:24:00.100]   Well, in his particular case,
[03:24:00.100 --> 03:24:02.020]   most of them are happening on his back.
[03:24:02.020 --> 03:24:04.880]   And so we bought a very simple pillow, basically,
[03:24:04.880 --> 03:24:06.300]   that went on his back,
[03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:08.120]   that kept him from sleeping on his back.
[03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:12.000]   And we saw an 85% reduction in sleep-awakeness issues
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:13.660]   the very first night.
[03:24:13.660 --> 03:24:14.880]   Now, we did that.
[03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:17.560]   Testosterone eventually tripled after three months
[03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:19.700]   by just improving sleep.
[03:24:19.700 --> 03:24:23.000]   And all we did is move him onto his left or right side.
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:26.000]   So huge improvements just by understanding
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.200]   where the problem occurred and why it occurred there.
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:30.460]   We didn't have to change hardly anything else.
[03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:32.340]   He had the basic hygiene stuff down
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:33.940]   and temperature and all that stuff.
[03:24:33.940 --> 03:24:37.360]   And he had his chili pad and all that to keep the thing cool.
[03:24:37.360 --> 03:24:38.200]   We couldn't fix it.
[03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:39.040]   Years, by the way.
[03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:42.100]   This took us two years of just trying everything.
[03:24:42.100 --> 03:24:42.940]   We're like, man.
[03:24:42.940 --> 03:24:45.100]   And it was just like, I wish,
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:46.740]   wish we could get you to sleep better.
[03:24:46.740 --> 03:24:48.460]   And I pulled out every trick I knew.
[03:24:48.460 --> 03:24:50.580]   And it's just, as soon as we built this dinner,
[03:24:50.580 --> 03:24:52.460]   I'm like, oh my God, it's all,
[03:24:52.460 --> 03:24:53.360]   he's not overweight, by the way.
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:54.860]   He doesn't have any, he's not iron deficient.
[03:24:54.860 --> 03:24:57.220]   He doesn't have any of these other classical symptoms
[03:24:57.220 --> 03:24:59.720]   that are associated with bad sleep.
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:03.360]   Supplementation, everything, we've done a thousand protocols.
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:04.380]   That fixed it overnight.
[03:25:04.380 --> 03:25:06.560]   So if it's not psychology and it's not physiology
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:08.240]   and it's not pathology, then the last one
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:11.180]   that people don't have any idea about is environment.
[03:25:11.180 --> 03:25:13.700]   And so what you don't realize is we have a box.
[03:25:13.700 --> 03:25:14.900]   We can sit right next to your bed.
[03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:15.740]   You just plug it in.
[03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:16.940]   You don't have to do anything.
[03:25:16.940 --> 03:25:18.720]   And it's gonna run full environmental scans.
[03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:20.380]   So it's gonna look at the temperature in your room.
[03:25:20.380 --> 03:25:22.220]   It's gonna look at the humidity in your room.
[03:25:22.220 --> 03:25:24.020]   It's gonna look at the volatile organic acids.
[03:25:24.020 --> 03:25:26.380]   These are things that are seeping out from your mattress.
[03:25:26.380 --> 03:25:27.880]   It's gonna look at particulates in the air
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:30.060]   and possible allergens and things that are floating around
[03:25:30.060 --> 03:25:32.700]   that are closing your nose off so you can't sleep at night.
[03:25:32.700 --> 03:25:35.620]   And now your mouth breathing and you've talked a lot,
[03:25:35.620 --> 03:25:38.340]   I'm sure on the previous episodes about why that's bad.
[03:25:38.340 --> 03:25:40.460]   It's gonna look at your CO2 cloud.
[03:25:40.460 --> 03:25:42.420]   So we've talked, we've already set this point up, right?
[03:25:42.420 --> 03:25:46.200]   You're inhaling O2, but then you're exhaling CO2.
[03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:48.000]   Well, during the day and when we're conversing,
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:51.280]   you have quite a bit of force with that exhalation, right?
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:56.280]   But at night, it's just barely seeping out of your mouth.
[03:25:57.240 --> 03:26:00.000]   So what happens is CO2 sends to cloud up
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:01.000]   and build around your face.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.080]   And then you end up re-breathing that CO2.
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:05.560]   And this can cause a large number of sleep problems
[03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:08.440]   because you're simply re-breathing in the panic.
[03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:11.340]   Whether you fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage,
[03:26:11.340 --> 03:26:13.720]   the CO2 around your face is a big issue.
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:15.220]   This stuff has all been known, by the way,
[03:26:15.220 --> 03:26:17.060]   with the astronauts for a very long time.
[03:26:17.060 --> 03:26:20.720]   It just hasn't translated into the commercial spaces.
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:23.760]   Of course, gone into our high performer space.
[03:26:23.760 --> 03:26:24.880]   So we can measure that as well.
[03:26:24.880 --> 03:26:27.200]   And then we can figure out, for the most extreme,
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:29.480]   we can actually come into a bedroom
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:32.800]   and build an entire sleep optimization setup
[03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:33.740]   and control the entire thing.
[03:26:33.740 --> 03:26:35.720]   But for most folks, the minimum we can do
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:38.760]   is run full diagnostics and check off,
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:40.180]   is this environment related?
[03:26:40.180 --> 03:26:42.520]   Is it pathologies or something else?
[03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:43.840]   - So is this a commercial device
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:45.840]   that people can eventually access?
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:46.840]   - It is now.
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:50.040]   - So where can people learn more about Absolute Rest?
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:51.400]   - Absoluterest.com.
[03:26:51.400 --> 03:26:52.240]   - Very cool.
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:53.960]   And just for our full disclosure,
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:56.580]   I wasn't aware that you had done this prior to today.
[03:26:56.580 --> 03:26:58.680]   You mentioned, I always like to ask people,
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:00.840]   scientists or otherwise, I always love to ask,
[03:27:00.840 --> 03:27:02.240]   what are you most excited about lately?
[03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:05.040]   And this sounds like an amazing technology.
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:06.080]   - And just to be really clear,
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:07.520]   that's not like something we're working on.
[03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:08.760]   That's landed.
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:09.600]   - That's landed.
[03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:10.420]   - We're ready to go.
[03:27:10.420 --> 03:27:11.260]   - Great.
[03:27:11.260 --> 03:27:13.240]   Well, and that's one of the things I appreciate about you
[03:27:13.240 --> 03:27:16.320]   is that you're willing to sometimes speculate,
[03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:17.660]   but you always say it's speculation.
[03:27:17.660 --> 03:27:19.960]   But in general, you seem like the kind of guy
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:23.320]   where if you're going to be public facing about something,
[03:27:23.320 --> 03:27:24.640]   if you're going to make a statement,
[03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:26.840]   there's got to be quite a bit behind it.
[03:27:26.840 --> 03:27:28.160]   You're not going to allude to the,
[03:27:28.160 --> 03:27:30.440]   in 10 years, we might be able to do this or in five years.
[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:32.120]   You're a very data-driven kind of guy.
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:34.860]   - Yeah, well, the people I work with, we need answers, right?
[03:27:34.860 --> 03:27:38.440]   We don't have that timeframe and we typically have like,
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:40.320]   hey, we start the season in four weeks.
[03:27:40.320 --> 03:27:41.980]   So that's just where I'm at.
[03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:45.120]   - Well, as I said, I appreciate that about you,
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:47.600]   but it is, but one of the many things I appreciate,
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:51.000]   I think the listeners and I can well appreciate
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:52.560]   on the basis of today's discussion,
[03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:56.360]   what a enormous wealth of information you are,
[03:27:56.360 --> 03:28:01.360]   how clear and potently you communicate that information,
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:05.960]   and also how you can take a huge cloud of information
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:10.320]   and still distill it into protocols that ought to work
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:13.200]   for 75% of people, 75% of the time,
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:16.420]   which is an immensely valuable thing to do.
[03:28:16.420 --> 03:28:19.320]   So for me and from the listeners,
[03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:20.700]   I just want to say thank you so much
[03:28:20.700 --> 03:28:22.920]   for taking the several now hours.
[03:28:22.920 --> 03:28:27.340]   I lose track of time, which reflects all good things.
[03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:30.540]   Several hours to take a break from teaching,
[03:28:30.540 --> 03:28:31.520]   take a break from research,
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:33.020]   take a break from the other important commitments
[03:28:33.020 --> 03:28:35.020]   of your life and really share with us
[03:28:35.020 --> 03:28:36.360]   all this incredible information.
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:38.080]   I'm so, so grateful.
[03:28:38.080 --> 03:28:38.920]   - My pleasure, man.
[03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:40.280]   I'm glad we finally got to connect.
[03:28:40.280 --> 03:28:42.040]   This has been a long time in the making.
[03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:47.040]   - It has, and I'm going to bring the breathing protocols
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:48.180]   to my training.
[03:28:48.180 --> 03:28:50.540]   I'm going to start doing more of the endurance type
[03:28:50.540 --> 03:28:52.040]   and interval type training.
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:53.560]   I'm going to start moving when I do heat.
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:55.160]   I'm going to start moving when I do cold.
[03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:57.340]   I might even start throwing some sodium bicarb
[03:28:57.340 --> 03:29:00.780]   into a very small amount of sodium bicarb
[03:29:00.780 --> 03:29:02.720]   into some water before I train.
[03:29:02.720 --> 03:29:06.560]   And listen, Andy, Professor Andy Galpin,
[03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:07.820]   thank you ever so much.
[03:29:07.820 --> 03:29:08.960]   - My pleasure.
[03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:10.840]   - Thank you for joining me today for my discussion

[03:30:08.940 --> 03:30:11.860]   During today's conversation and on many previous episodes
[03:30:11.860 --> 03:30:14.700]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[03:30:14.700 --> 03:30:16.900]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:30:16.900 --> 03:30:19.260]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:30:19.260 --> 03:30:21.980]   for things like sleep and focus and energy,
[03:30:21.980 --> 03:30:24.440]   and many other features of our physiology
[03:30:24.440 --> 03:30:25.780]   and mental functioning.
[03:30:25.780 --> 03:30:27.260]   There are some important issues to consider
[03:30:27.260 --> 03:30:28.700]   when considering supplements.
[03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:31.400]   One of those issues is the quality of the ingredients.
[03:30:31.400 --> 03:30:35.020]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:37.300]   because Thorne supplements have the highest possible
[03:30:37.300 --> 03:30:38.900]   standards with respect to the quality
[03:30:38.900 --> 03:30:40.600]   of the ingredients they include.
[03:30:40.600 --> 03:30:42.580]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[03:30:42.580 --> 03:30:47.580]   you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com/u/huberman.
[03:30:48.300 --> 03:30:50.480]   And there you'll see the supplements that I take,
[03:30:50.480 --> 03:30:53.640]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:55.780]   If you navigate further into the Thorne site
[03:30:55.780 --> 03:30:59.140]   through that website, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[03:30:59.140 --> 03:31:01.900]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[03:31:01.900 --> 03:31:02.880]   that Thorne makes.
[03:31:02.880 --> 03:31:04.740]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[03:31:04.740 --> 03:31:07.360]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[03:31:07.360 --> 03:31:09.980]   There I discuss science and science-based tools,
[03:31:09.980 --> 03:31:11.540]   some of which overlap with the content
[03:31:11.540 --> 03:31:12.940]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:31:12.940 --> 03:31:14.060]   but much of which is distinct
[03:31:14.060 --> 03:31:16.280]   from the information covered on this podcast.
[03:31:16.280 --> 03:31:18.340]   Thank you once again for joining me for my discussion
[03:31:18.340 --> 03:31:21.000]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, and as always,
[03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:22.960]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:25.540]   [upbeat music]
[03:31:25.540 --> 03:31:28.120]   (upbeat music)
