[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Last year we made $36,000 just from deals that we did online,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   spending about 10 to 15 hours per week doing those deals,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920]   along with two and a half million points.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.280]   It's so diverse.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.200]   I think people, when they think of profitable deals,
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200]   they may think of credit card bonuses.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.560]   That's the first one that comes to mind.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.920]   And I think credit card bonuses are very lucrative,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.080]   but an aspect that people often don't think about
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.120]   that's also very profitable are bank signup bonuses
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.040]   and brokerage signup bonuses.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.000]   Those can yield a lot of just straight cash,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.560]   liquid cash that you can use
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.600]   as like a buffer for your finances.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.800]   But then there's also like a plethora
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.240]   of other little things, you know,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.400]   saving money on cell phones, meal kits.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.080]   You can find ways to try and generate spend
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.240]   for your credit cards so that if you're someone
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.800]   that's not spending a million dollars a year
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.760]   on your credit cards,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.200]   you can still meet a lot of these signup bonuses.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.160]   It's just so many things.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.120]   There's like buying groups you can participate in,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.400]   reselling gift cards.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.520]   It's hard, I think, to pin it down.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.820]   So I think profitable deals is a good descriptor for it.
