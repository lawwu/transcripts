[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240]   All right, let's do a question here from Gabriel.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.720]   Gabriel asks,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   how do you manage projects versus detailed to-dos on your
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.600]   board system?
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.320]   And there's a useful elaboration here because this is an important,
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.600]   but subtle issue. So Gabriel says,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.560]   I've been using a Trello type system to organize projects,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.520]   which has been helpful to visualize their different statuses.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.000]   Then it helps me to choose priorities for a given quarter. However,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.640]   as I've been catching up on your podcast,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.240]   I've also recognized the value of a Trello type treatment of your to-dos to give
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.080]   clarity to them.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.520]   Do you have separate boards for these two tasks with different magnitudes or how
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.660]   do you keep track of the status of any project or store them for later focus for
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.020]   a given quarter? Yeah, it's a good question, Gabriel.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.160]   So I use my Trello boards for tasks.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.600]   I will occasionally have a column on a relevant Trello board for a project.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.940]   So here is a project I'm working on. That's going to generate a lot of tasks.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.140]   I will give it its own column so that the tasks relevant to that project are
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.980]   in that column. So that's, that's somewhat common.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.140]   I don't do this for every project though. Some projects,
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.860]   I know they're ongoing because I have them in my quarterly plan.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100]   And when I build my weekly plan,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.260]   I see that and just figure out when and how am I going to make progress on that
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.780]   project during the current week.
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.100]   So where this becomes relevant is there are certain projects that are not
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.260]   fruitfully divided into tasks.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.100]   This is one of my points of minor respectful disagreement with David
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.780]   Allen. I think in David Allen system, everything goes down to cranking widgets.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.060]   Everything goes down to a next action that you can just execute.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.620]   And he has this mind like water dream where you're just mindlessly executing
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.640]   these very clearly specified 60 second tasks. And in the end,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.500]   you look up and say, huh, there's like a really nice New Yorker piece in a new
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.780]   book. The problem is,
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.340]   this is not actually how a lot of type of particularly demanding cognitive work
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.860]   happens. You can't take a book and break it down into 60 second next actions.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.020]   You can't take a hard article and break it down in the 60 second next actions.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.820]   There's often a, a mini steps, let's say that's just
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.460]   ambiguously speaking,
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.540]   think really hard on this and see if you can make progress.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.640]   Like how do I crack this article? I don't know.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.440]   I need to think about it a lot and read stuff and just try to figure it out.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.040]   How do I get this chapter written?
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.480]   It's going to take me just hours and hours of writing. I mean,
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.640]   do I put it in a task?
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.360]   I can't put write 10,000 words on a task because it can take five different
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800]   sessions. Do I have like put session number one as a task? I guess,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   like break it down into different tasks for different writing sessions.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.360]   I guess I could do that, but it doesn't seem congruent.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.420]   It seems like not a good fit. And so for this type of demanding cognitive work,
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.760]   I've realized it's better to just have in your quarterly plan,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.600]   I'm working on a book and in this quarter, I want to finish two chapters.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.460]   And you see that when you're building your weekly plan,
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.960]   you're looking at your week ahead and said, okay,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.880]   I'm going to really go for it this week.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.200]   I'm going to really try to get a draft of this chapter done this week.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.800]   So I'm going to go on my calendar right now,
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.840]   maybe and I'm going to take the first three hours of Monday, Tuesday,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.520]   Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I just cleared the decks, no meetings,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.800]   go right to the writing shed and write. And, and it's whatever, 10 hours,
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.360]   15 hours worth of writing. Let's just see if that works.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.240]   And if I can make progress on it, there's no real task intermediary here.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.640]   It's me seeing, I have this hard project,
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.560]   knowing there's something hard to need to do looking at my week,
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.260]   reconfiguring my week. So I can do that type of have time for that type of hard
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.100]   thing.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.440]   So this is why I do not have a one-to-one correspondence between my projects and
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.120]   columns on my Trello board. Some very tasky oriented projects. Yes, absolutely.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.380]   You know, if we're doing admissions for grad students,
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.100]   I'm the director of graduate studies. Yeah.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.700]   There's 15 things that have to happen.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.660]   I need a place to keep track of all the information for each of these things.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.740]   And I got to keep track of who's working on what,
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.260]   and I'm going to have a whole list of tasks.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.980]   I'm also going to have another column that is waiting to hear back from,
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.740]   so I can keep track of,
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.540]   I'm waiting to hear back from the registrar's office about this and a whole
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.960]   column for the meetings I have every week with the graduate coordinator.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.380]   So I can keep track of here's the five things I need to talk about the next
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.820]   meeting. It's perfect for that.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.460]   My task board has very little to do with my books.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.700]   It has very little to do sometimes with working on articles as very little to do
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.140]   with trying to solve a math proof.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.020]   I go straight from my quarterly plan right to my weekly plan.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.620]   And that influences my daily plan. No task board is involved.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.660]   The final piece of your question, Gabriel's,
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.040]   how do you keep track of potential projects?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.420]   I don't know that I really do that much. Like to me, that's not the hard thing.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.460]   It's usually pretty clear. You know, you're doing a quarterly plan. Like what's,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.320]   what's the, what am I working on for the next three or four months?
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.920]   I don't really need a list of things that I could be working on. I mean,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.480]   at this level, at the David Allen, 30,000 foot level,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.920]   you know what you're all about. You pretty much intuitively can figure out.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.560]   I think I need to do a book proposal. I'm making progress on a book.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.520]   I'm working on this academic new field or something like this.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.320]   I don't need a list of potential projects.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   Not when I'm at the scale of what do I want to do this fall?
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.020]   This is more about reflecting on my career in general,
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.420]   my vision for my career, where I am, what's been going well,
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.180]   what's been going bad. I'm not going to have any trouble saying,
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.420]   here's the big rocks I'm going to try to put into the schedule.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.120]   So I don't keep track of list of projects. One day,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.100]   maybe projects at the scale of really big swing things.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.020]   You're going to come up with good ideas. That's not the hard part.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.380]   The hard part is when you actually have to start executing.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   [inaudible].
