[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   All right, everybody, welcome back to the all in podcast. We're very excited today to do our third
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.760]   deep dive long form discussion with presidential candidates for the 2024 election started with
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.600]   RFK. And he got a huge boost in the ratings after it was on the pod. We had Vivek and now
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.680]   Governor Chris Christie is with us. Governor, thanks for coming.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.120]   My pleasure. Thanks for having me guys.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.840]   Alright, so it's a little bit different here than I think some of the other news hits
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.760]   that you do. This is not short form is long form. We like to, you know, have a thoughtful discussion
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.920]   with the candidates, not with talking points. And I know that you're a straight shooter. So I think
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.800]   you'll fit right in here with the other boys. I think you're very unique amongst candidates
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.720]   that you've actually brought up the deficit, as we know, just two facts here. And then I'll hand
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.840]   it over to free bird for his question. Last two administrations have run up the deficit massively.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.720]   Here's a chart of our debt, Trump added almost a trillion Biden's added 4 trillion. And this is
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.800]   obviously an unpopular issue to bring up. As you've mentioned, bringing this up is unpopular
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.080]   doesn't get you votes necessary to say we have to cut spending. And free bird and I are very much
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.040]   I'll speak for myself. This is my number one issue in terms of picking a candidate freeberg. I think
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.280]   you said it's your number one issue. So freeberg I'll hand it over to you in terms of a question
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.480]   for Governor Christie. Yeah, Governor Christie, nice to see you. You and I sang on a karaoke
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.560]   stage together in Idaho a few years ago. But it's I do remember that. Yeah. Is that a sly way of
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.600]   saying Idaho, I had to put that two and two together there. Everyone nice free bird was a
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.120]   small bar in Idaho. Oh, small bar in Idaho, small establishment classes for all gather up with a
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.000]   few few folks who happen to be in a bar together at the B conference that shall not be named.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.640]   Rain Man David Sacks.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:20.480]   We watched the Republican primary debate a few weeks ago. And I think what struck me at least
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   was how little focus and attention is given on the fiscal situation, the US government deficit
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.960]   in excess of $2 trillion this year, debt to GDP in excess of 130% 30 plus percent of US debt is
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.320]   coming to you in the next year, which means it's going to get refinanced at the higher rates of
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.720]   probably five and a half percent plus. And then when you look at the demands on Social Security,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.520]   Medicare, forecasts are that both of those systems necessarily go bankrupt, unless there's
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.600]   some extraordinary measures taken. And that seems to be a very kind of hot topic, golden goose that
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.320]   can't be touched or debated. All of this seems to be largely ignored. And so much of the conversation
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.040]   is around social issues in the United States, military issues, war, etc. When fundamentally,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.920]   there's no gas in the tank. I guess the point of view I'd love to hear from you is how do you think
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.240]   about that? Does that matter to you right now? Or do we think that this is a can that we kick down
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.960]   the road and we'll solve this problem later, we'll grow our way out of it. If we cut some spending,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.360]   it'll fix itself. It seems so core to me that the future of the United States is going to be
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.400]   dependent on how we're going to manage this fiscal emergency that we're facing.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.800]   Well, look, David, it's core to me, too. And I'm, you know, if you've seen any of the excerpts from
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.760]   any of the town hall meetings I've done so far, you know, I've been talking about both the issues
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   you just raised. First off, I think on the deficit and debt side, I learned about this after becoming
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.160]   a prosecutor and having to come to New Jersey and inherit two problems immediately. We had a $2
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.120]   billion short-term deficit for the last five months of the fiscal year that I inherited.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.640]   And then we had an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget for the fiscal year starting July
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.880]   1 of 2010. And I had to deal with both those things. And as you know, unlike the chart that
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.800]   was just shown, you don't get to run it up. You have to square it. And so, you know, I learned
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.280]   how hard it is and how ugly it's going to be for your popularity to do these things. So on the
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.800]   first piece, on the $2 billion, we sat down, I refused to raise taxes, and we sat down and we
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   eliminated 683 individual programs completely and then swept every surplus from a school board in
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.960]   the state. And the way we did that was we reduced their state aid by the amount they had in surplus
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.960]   to get the $2 billion in balance. And then extended that into the next budget cycle,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.120]   kept all those cuts in place, which did some structural, you know, refiguring of the deficit,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.960]   and then made additional cuts after that. You know, I'd gotten elected with 48.5% of the vote.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.520]   And after I did that, my approval ratings went down below 40 in my first six months.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.360]   But what I knew was it was absolutely necessary because in our state, we were already overtaxed,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.840]   and the idea of raising taxes again was not an option that was, to me, viable. So when you learn
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.040]   and you go through that process, and then you look at what we're dealing with federally, I think you
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.400]   realize three things right off the bat. One, it is an imperative that we need to reduce spending.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.600]   What it's doing to inflation and the long-term ability of the country to grow,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.880]   it makes it absolutely necessary. Two, to me, kicking the can down the road is not an option
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.200]   because the problem's only gonna get worse, and it's going to begin to impact our ability to be
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.920]   able to do some of the core things that government is supposed to do. And then third, that you've got
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:27.600]   to be willing to sacrifice popularity for results. And I'm not gonna sit here and say it'll be fun to
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.960]   do. It won't be. But I went through it once already on a smaller scale, and quite frankly,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.400]   you have a much longer runway to do it at the federal level than I did at the state level.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.960]   I had hard deadlines of June 30, 2010, and July 1, 2010 to accomplish both.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.520]   On the entitlement side, I think I'm the only person who's been talking about this
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.360]   and saying out loud, "We've got to consider raising retirement age, and we've got to consider
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:06.320]   means testing and eligibility for Social Security." And those also, I remember watching Biden's
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.640]   State of the Union address, and to me, the most disgusting part of it was when he said,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.360]   "Can we all agree we're not gonna touch Social Security?" And both sides stood up and cheered.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.720]   Yeah, I agree. That was the worst moment for me as well.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.040]   Liars and hypocrites. They all know it's going broke in 11 years, and that's an automatic 24%
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.680]   benefit cut on the Social Security side, and automatic 25% Medicare benefit cut on that side.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.680]   So you're not gonna be able to let that happen. And so you gotta deal with those issues,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:45.120]   and I think you can deal with them through both eligibility issues regarding means testing,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.640]   and you can deal with it by also dealing with retirement age. Retirement age, I would do it
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.920]   over the longer term, not for people in their 50s and 60s currently, but for people in their
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.440]   40s and below.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.560]   And let me just say one follow-up, because to your point, I think the recent polling showed
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.320]   something like 83% plus of Americans support the benefit they get from these two programs,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.240]   Social Security and Medicare, that it should not be touched, that that is the popular
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.840]   opinion, that is what the voters are saying. Do you not think that you put yourself at risk
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.480]   in your campaign by making these statements? And how do you get elected and instigate change?
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:31.280]   I put myself at risk by running, let alone put myself at risk. I just think you have to be
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:38.480]   honest with people. It's 11 years, it's not 20 years, it's 11 now. And it means that if the next
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.560]   president doesn't deal with it, then it is going to be in absolute crisis mode when it has to be
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.040]   dealt with. We'll be inside three years. And at that point, the options will be even fewer. So
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.680]   yeah, of course, it's, and I know someone will run a commercial...
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.920]   By the way, is that the part, is that the behind closed door conversation? Is that what's going on?
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.400]   Is the folks that you know, that you talk with, everyone behind the closed door, when they're not
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   in front of the camera, are saying, "We are going to have to deal with this in the next
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.560]   presidential administration"?
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.360]   Yeah. But they all say, "I can't believe you're saying it out loud."
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.560]   Right.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.520]   But to me, we are in such a bad place in politics in this country. If we don't start telling the
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.200]   people the truth about the problems we have, we're never going to have an opportunity to solve them.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.720]   And that's risky, but my entire candidacy is risky. So you might as well just go for it and
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.800]   tell people what you really think. And I do think there are a number of people out there who are
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:44.320]   thinking people. I think most people who answer that 83% number, you know, David, are people who
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.600]   don't even know that we're 11 years away from insolvency, because nobody talks about that part.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.520]   And if you don't talk about that part, why would any of them want Social Security touched?
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.960]   But I'm finding in my town hall meetings, when I tell people, "It's 11 years from insolvency,"
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.400]   how would you deal with a 25% cut, 24% cut in your Social Security benefit?
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:16.880]   People, older folks in particular, look horrified. And so, you know, I think it's an educational
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.720]   process. And I've always tried to treat politics at least in part that way, that, you know,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.560]   something I say in New Jersey all the time when press would ask me about a poll that didn't like
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.080]   a position I was taking on an issue, I'd say, you know, a leader's job is not to follow polls,
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.600]   it's to change them. And my job is to change them and to persuade and convince through facts and
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.920]   argument that this is the right way to go. And sometimes you'll win and sometimes you won't.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.160]   But if you don't tackle the problems, what the hell are you doing there? You know,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.000]   the housing behind you is nice, but, you know, frankly, it's not worth it to me if I'm going to
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.920]   go there and just be another one to kick this can down the road as, you know, Obama, Trump,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.880]   and Biden have all done. Bush tried to do something about it, and the Congress rejected it.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.560]   But Obama, you know, Trump, and Biden have done nothing.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:21.760]   What are your top two areas where you would cut in order to save entitlements? What are the other
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:29.200]   areas where you would go to find savings? Well, look, I think we have to look at social spending
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.520]   in general that's really drastically increased post-COVID, and those increases have not been
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.800]   taken back. So, I think you have to look at all the programs that were ramped up during COVID
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:49.760]   and say, "Okay, what's it going to be to bring it back to pre-COVID spending to start?" And then,
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.200]   after you do that, a further evaluation of those programs to see if they're effective.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.120]   And I think that would get you a good part of the way there, given how much spending
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:09.200]   increased during COVID. I think, secondly, we need to look at the way we fund education in
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:17.360]   this country as well, and whether or not when we're spending $800 billion, what do we do with
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.760]   the $80 billion the federal government spends? Another place, an interesting place to look.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:29.360]   Small in comparison to a $2 trillion debt, I understand, but that's another place I would look.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   And the only place I really wouldn't look is on the military side at this point,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   because I think you've got to increase efficiency and effectiveness at the Pentagon.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:46.480]   But on the other hand, I don't think that this is the time to be cutting back there when our Navy
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.240]   and Air Force are both in the conditions they're in.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:55.600]   It's a good segue with the military. Obviously, one of the major differences in thinking on this
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:02.720]   pod and a big debate inside the Republican Party is around, should we defend Ukraine?
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:09.440]   And then, eventually, will we defend Taiwan? And so, maybe I'll hand it off to David.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.520]   I'm stunned that this is coming up on your pod.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.200]   Yeah. It's a point of contention.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.440]   I won't speak for Sachs, but I'm for it, Governor.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:27.200]   Yes, sir. As does my oldest son listen to it. So, in times when I miss, my son Andrew is...
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.960]   And he wanted to give me a full briefing before I was going to go on the pod today.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.000]   And his evaluation of all of you. I told him I was going to refrain from that because I didn't
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.200]   want to bring his biases into the interview. But...
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.440]   Can you at least tell us what his evaluations were?
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.200]   Well, afterwards I will.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.400]   Afterwards, yeah.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.520]   Absolutely. Well, okay.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.040]   By the way, our path to presidential candidates is through the sons, it seems.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.320]   It's kind of a common...
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.400]   It's actually RFK's sons, very big into the pod. David, of course, is a pacifist. He's a
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.640]   longtime GOP member, but doesn't believe we should be fighting never-ending wars.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.960]   Let me go back. Yeah, let me level set here on foreign policy first, before we get into Ukraine.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.680]   I want to go back to the Bush era, forever wars, the Iraq war. One of the reasons why Trump,
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:20.240]   I think, really took off in 2016 is he was the first Republican to really come out and say
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.320]   that the Iraq war and all these Middle East and forever wars we got into was a big mistake.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.840]   And even though he was for it when we did it.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.000]   Okay. Well, fair enough. But he said on the campaign trail...
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.400]   Well...
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.880]   Hold on, let me just finish the question. In 2016, he said that Bush lied us into the war,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   and he said, "No more Bushes." Putting aside Trump for a second, we can get to Trump.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.360]   What is your view on it? Do you fundamentally agree with that, that we were lied into the Iraq
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:51.040]   war? Do you defend it? No, I think that most people would admit that we were misled. I wouldn't use
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:58.960]   the word lied. I would say misled into the Iraq war because of the WMD issue. I mean, I supported
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:05.920]   the Iraq war because of WMD. And I thought if Saddam Hussein had WMD, that that was something
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.400]   that we had to deal with in the context of the post-9/11 world. When it turned out that he didn't
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.080]   have WMD, I don't think there would have been many people who would have been supportive
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:25.120]   of the Iraq war absent WMD. So I thought Trump's statements in 2016 were typical for him.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.640]   He changed his opinion, and instead of giving a rational reason for it, he gave a sophomoric one.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.680]   And so I don't give him a whole lot of credit for that, but...
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.120]   Nat: Well, you did at the time in a sense. I mean, when Bush said... Sorry, Trump said that
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.760]   Bush lied us into the Iraq war at the South Carolina debate. That was on February 13th.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.000]   You endorsed him on February 26th.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.600]   Reid: Yeah. So what's that mean?
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.880]   Nat: Well, I mean, if you thought his answer was sophomoric, why'd you endorse him two weeks later?
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.320]   Reid: I endorsed him because I was convinced he was gonna be the Republican nominee for president,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.760]   and I didn't want Hillary Clinton to be the president. And so having been in that race,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.320]   competed with him, after he won South Carolina, convinced he was gonna be the nominee,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.120]   and having at that time had a 15-year relationship with him, my view was I could go in there and try
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.360]   to make him a better candidate, and if he won, a better president. And that's why I endorsed him.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.720]   Absolutely nothing to do with his sophomoric answer on that. I didn't like his answer on the
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.760]   wall either saying Mexico was gonna pay for it. I thought that was sophomoric as well. But you know
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.360]   what? In American politics, you don't get to all vote for the candidate you wanna vote for.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.680]   You get to vote for the ones who are left. And if I had my first choice in '16, it would have been me,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.760]   but that didn't work out. So I defaulted into Trump because I thought he was a better choice
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   than Hillary Clinton. And by the way, still do think he was a better choice than Hillary Clinton.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.560]   Nat: Okay.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.520]   Reid: But you probably agree with that, right, Sax? You thought Trump would be a better choice
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.240]   than Hillary Clinton?
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.480]   I mean, honestly, back in 2016, I wasn't sure what to make of Trump because he was such a,
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.200]   you know, outsider and sort of a wrecking ball. I agree with him about the Iraq War,
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.880]   but I can accept the governor's answer that we were misled on that war. And if we had known
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.400]   the truth about it, we never would have gotten into it. So I think we can all agree on that.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.040]   Nat: Yep.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.280]   Reid: I wanna get to Ukraine, but just quickly, 2012, do you regret not running in 2012? There's
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.640]   a lot of commentators who say that you kind of were the Trump before Trump, you had this combative
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.440]   style, this kind of take no prisoners sort of attitude, and you kind of had a moment in 2012
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.160]   where it looked like maybe you could have been the front runner or the candidate. I guess,
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.440]   why didn't you go for it in 2012? And I mean, do you regret that at all?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.600]   Reid: I don't regret it, and I wasn't ready to be president, and that's why I didn't run.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:56.720]   I know it seems quaint now after Barack Obama and Donald Trump have been president, but back in 2012,
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.240]   I really felt like it was necessary to feel in your heart and your mind you were ready. When
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:08.000]   people started talking about me running for president, I hadn't even been governor for a year.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.360]   And before that, I'd been a prosecutor. And in my heart, I just didn't feel like
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:23.760]   I was ready to be president. And if I don't feel something in here, I'm not gonna be very effective
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.040]   at making the argument politically, nor am I gonna be able to convince people to give me their money,
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.920]   which you need to do as well. And so, no, I don't regret it. And by the way, all those
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.680]   commentators who say that never ran for a goddamn thing in their lives. And they all can think,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.040]   "Oh, you would have won. You would have beaten Romney, and you would have beaten Obama."
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.080]   Maybe I would have, maybe I wouldn't have, but that's kind of like the dog catching the garbage
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.400]   truck. If you don't think you're ready and you catch it, the worst moment wouldn't have been
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.640]   losing that election. The worst moment might have been winning it and getting into the Oval Office
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.840]   for the first time and saying, "Oh my God, am I really ready to do this?" So I don't have any
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:12.000]   regrets. I really don't. And everybody who usually commentates in that way are people who have never
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.520]   put their name on a ballot for anything. And until you do that, you don't know what it feels like and
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.680]   what it means to have to offer yourself up to people for anything, let alone for president.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.920]   - Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Going chronologically here, 2014, Biden is now Obama's vice president.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.680]   He requests the Ukraine portfolio to run it for Obama. There is a famous phone call that gets
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.440]   leaked where our deputy secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, is on tape picking the new
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.160]   government of Ukraine, which takes effect a few weeks later after the violent overthrow
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.640]   of the democratically elected Ukrainian government, the Yanukovych government.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.720]   Three months after that, Hunter Biden is appointed to the board of Burisma.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:03.120]   Do you believe that that appointment was made for any other reason than Joe Biden
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.520]   was the de facto ruler of Ukraine? - I don't know about him being the
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.080]   de facto ruler of Ukraine. - I mean, he was the one...
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.120]   - I don't think Joe Biden can be the de facto ruler of anything, but...
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:22.160]   - Well, no, let me clarify what I mean by that. On the Victoria Nuland phone call, she says she
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:29.200]   needs to get approval from Biden and Jake Sullivan as national security advisor for this new Ukrainian
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.400]   government that she's picking. So she basically is saying that Biden is the boss, he's gonna sign
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.880]   off on this. They apparently get the approval from Biden, and that government does go into effect
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:48.480]   after what appears to be a US-backed coup. So Biden clearly has enormous influence over that
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.000]   country. Now, okay, it's a little too glib. - Or Jake Sullivan.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.840]   - Or Jake Sullivan. So look, it's too glib to say he's the ruler of the country, so I don't mean
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:01.920]   that. I just mean he's the ultimate authority, it seems like, in approving or picking this new
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.120]   government. Three months after he does that, Hunter Biden's appointed to the board of barisma.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.840]   So my point to you is, what reason could there be for Hunter Biden's appointment other than
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.120]   Joe Biden's influence over that country? - None.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.440]   - There you have it. - What else you want me to say?
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.480]   - So a year later, so 2015... - I don't know why Sachs became a
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.440]   venture capitalist. He should have been a prosecutor. - Absolutely.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.520]   - It's just incredible. I'm overwhelmed at the moment as a former prosecutor.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.680]   - Because he's sweating, oh my God. Sachs has you on the ropes.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   - Well, no, I'm just, I'm trying to get a great presidential...
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.560]   - Sachs, flip to page 13. - Yeah, come on, Sachs.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.720]   - No, no, no, I want to get... - This is a four-hour podcast.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.520]   - Yeah, it feels like... - This is gonna be quick.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.160]   - We're gonna go day by day over the last decade. - No, this is gonna be quick.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.800]   - And then Hunter Biden's gonna crack. - I want to establish common ground.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.200]   - When you were 14 years old on the middle school playground and you pushed that kid Bobby,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.640]   what were you thinking? - No, I'm actually establishing
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.080]   common ground with the governor before I get into areas you might disagree. Okay.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.600]   - Okay, here we go. - Excellent.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.840]   - Okay, so 2015, you have this prosecutor named Shokin, this Ukrainian prosecutor who is
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.160]   investigating Burisma. Joe Biden, according to his own acknowledgement on a videotape,
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.560]   I think he was speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations, says that he gets Shokin fired.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.680]   And then magically, the investigation into Burisma stops. Do you think that was in
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.600]   furtherance of stopping corruption in Ukraine or was that an effort by Joe Biden to protect himself
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.000]   or his son from this investigation? - I think we're gonna find out as
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.880]   continued congressional oversight occurs and the special counsel, I hope, investigation broadens.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   So I'm not ready to say I know that for sure, but I'll tell you this much, there's enough smoke
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:58.480]   there that we gotta see where the fire is. And I'd also say about Biden, I would never discount,
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.960]   not as a substitute motivation, but perhaps as an additional one, the fact that he likes to pretend
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:12.240]   he's in charge of things. But instead, his staff is really in charge. And that's how you get trained
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.080]   in the United States Senate. Your staff really runs everything, at least with many of the senators.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:26.000]   And that's why it's such a bad training ground for the presidency in my view. But I digress
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.040]   myself. I'd say it is a likely motivation. It may not be the only one. And it's something I'm
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:39.360]   certainly intrigued to find out about as oversight moves forward. And I hope the special counsel's
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:45.760]   investigation broadens into the specifics of then Vice President Biden's involvement
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.280]   with his son's business dealings. Let's talk about that for a second. There was,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.600]   I guess, the most recent revelation is that Joe Biden was communicating with his son under
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:00.560]   a pseudonym or a burner account. Was it Robert Peters? In your experience as a prosecutor,
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.080]   is there any legitimate reason why somebody would wanna use a pseudonym for communicating
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:14.560]   with their son? Look, burner accounts always raise my eyebrows as a former prosecutor.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.320]   But what I will say is that I would understand someone in public life, if they're communicating
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:27.840]   with family, wanting to do that in a way where it wouldn't be detected by folks who are prying in
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.280]   one way or the other, whether that might be media, but more particularly hackers and other folks
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.600]   who are able to do things that I really don't have much understanding of,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:44.560]   except to be fearful of them. So I don't wanna say that is a de facto proof point, David.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.360]   But again, going back to my seven years as a US attorney, when I saw someone having a burner phone
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.400]   or other types of burner accounts, definitely made me say, "Let's take a look a little more
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.560]   closely at that and see what we can find." So at a minimum, it's suspicious for sure
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.280]   and deserves inquiry. Yeah, especially after Biden said he had no involvement with his son's
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.600]   business dealings. And we found out from Devin Archer's sworn testimony, who is Hunter Biden's
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.880]   partner, that Biden participated in 20 phone calls with clients to be the brand. So it's-
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   If we go too far down the Biden and Trump well, which will give us tons of, I think, material,
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:34.640]   maybe we can get to Ukraine, which the Ukraine war and who do you think's ultimately responsible
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.960]   for the invasion of Ukraine? Do you think the United States-
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.840]   Obviously, the governor has said he supports Ukraine and he believes that Putin's responsible.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.600]   I'd like to hear from him, Sachs. Yeah, so maybe just in terms of governor, do you think
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.280]   the United States is responsible for the invasion of Ukraine because we didn't do enough in terms
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.760]   of taking NATO off the table, like some people think? Or do you think Putin is responsible for
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.000]   invading Ukraine because he invaded Ukraine? I don't wanna lead the witness.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   You already did. But my answer is that Putin is responsible. Now-
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.160]   Shocking.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:19.920]   I do think, though, that United States inaction and bad signal sending to Putin,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.600]   going all the way back to George W. Bush, who said, "I looked into his eyes and saw his soul,"
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:36.800]   then to Barack Obama, who was completely uninterested in anything. And when Putin moves
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:43.520]   on Ukraine under the Obama administration, he did nothing, to Donald Trump, who saw it as an
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:52.240]   opportunity to extort Vladimir Zelensky to get dirt on Joe Biden in return for military aid,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.000]   to Joe Biden, who I think has been a hand-wringer on this issue. And when he said, "Well, maybe a
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.880]   small invasion wouldn't be so bad," it reminds me of something I said to folks when I was US attorney,
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.920]   everybody's definition of the word small is different, and you can't assume what they mean
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.640]   is the same thing you mean. So I do think there were American actions and inactions,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:23.760]   which contributed to sending signals to Putin that maybe we wouldn't care if he did it. But
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.320]   that's a small sliver, in my view, of the responsibility, the lion's share of the
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   responsibility is, in my view, on Putin. Fair enough. Would you admit Ukraine into NATO?
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:42.400]   Well, I think in the situation we're in now, David, it's almost a de facto point at this
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:51.200]   point. I think that given that we permitted Russia to do what they did, given that they have now
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:57.920]   executed what they've executed in terms of their aggression against Ukraine, and the NATO support
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:05.600]   from a military hardware and intelligence perspective for Ukraine, I think it is now
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.640]   a foregone conclusion that Ukraine will be admitted to NATO. And frankly,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.520]   it's got to be now I think one of the penalties and one of the prices that Putin pays for his
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.400]   aggression. But when would you do that? I mean, so Jens Stoltenberg at the Vilnius Summit made
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.800]   it explicit that Ukraine's future is in NATO, but it could not happen unless and until they win this
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.200]   war. Would you admit them sooner than that? No. Okay. No, I would not. Because that would lead
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.880]   to World War Three, obviously. That's what I'm attempting to avoid. Yeah. Okay, fair enough.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:45.920]   Would you have been willing to take NATO expansion off the table in 2021 in order to avoid a war?
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.200]   No, I think that was too late. If you were going to take NATO expansion off of the table,
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   if you were going to do it, it would have been done much earlier. Because if you did it then,
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:04.240]   that would essentially be giving in to Putin's threat. And I think that would have sent an even
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.640]   worse signal than some of the signals that I mentioned before. So no, I wouldn't have been
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.760]   willing to do it in '21 in order to avoid it. Because quite frankly, I don't believe that it
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.360]   would have avoided it. It just would have forestalled it. Do you believe that we made
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.440]   the correct decision? I mean, I know I'm going way back here, but in 2008 at the Bucharest Summit,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.880]   we declared our intention to bring Ukraine and Georgia for that matter into NATO, but we didn't
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.000]   have a plan to do it. Do you believe that was a mistake? I think it was a mistake not to... If
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.360]   you're going to do it, you should have a plan that lays out exactly how and when and why.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:46.560]   And I think just expressing aspirational goals in that regard is dangerous in foreign policy
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.000]   in that regard. And so I think the mistake was made, not necessarily by ever having Ukraine
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   in NATO, but by doing it the way it was done, again, was in my view an unnecessary, or at least
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.360]   not well thought out, provocation. Is there anything about Joe Biden's policy in Ukraine
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:12.080]   that you would change? Yeah, I would have been much more aggressive in providing military hardware
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:20.800]   much sooner than what he did. And I think he's been the ham ringer on it. Every step has been
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:33.120]   preceded by fretting and furrowing brows and ham ring. And I think if you're going to be in this,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.960]   you have to give them the tools they need to win. When I met with Zelensky a month ago,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:46.160]   he made it very clear to me he had no interest in American or allied troops in Ukraine,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:55.040]   now or ever. He felt this was Ukraine's war to win or lose, but that they needed the military
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:04.080]   hardware necessary to compete in this war against Russia. And that my view of what their biggest
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.400]   concerns were, which the ones that I agree with, are the pace and amount of armaments that have
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.320]   been given, not only by the US, but by the rest of the NATO allies as well.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.680]   I mean, for a lot of us, let me just ask a couple of quick follow ups here, and then we can move on.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.160]   I mean, for a lot of us, Biden has not been half hearted about this. He sought $113 billion
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.400]   appropriation. That seems like a ton of money that could have been spent domestically. What
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:35.520]   little hand wringing there was, was on the giving of F-16s and Abrams tanks. And the reason for that,
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.800]   Biden said, was that it could lead to World War Three. I mean, are you not concerned about those
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.640]   kinds of escalations? I mean, isn't that a good thing to be concerned about, not dismissive about?
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.320]   It's always important to be concerned about it, but you have to be thoughtful about it
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:57.120]   and look at what the alternatives are. And to me, the alternative of allowing the combination of
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:07.840]   China and Russia to route Ukraine is something that's not in the US vital interests and will
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:15.200]   lead to other problems as well with China going forward. And so, none of these are easy decisions,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:21.840]   Dave, but what they are, are the ones that you want someone who is thoughtful and has some
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.920]   experience making them as president. And I don't think Biden checks either of those boxes
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.600]   sufficiently. And I think his conduct has shown that. And by the way, the same applies to Trump.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.200]   Paul What do you think the resolution is here? And if in, I don't know, 16 months,
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.000]   you're president or when you're president, how would you deal with this if the war is still
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.600]   raging here?
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.520]   Dave Well, I think it depends on what
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.840]   disposition the war is in at that point. Jason, I think you have to evaluate how successful
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:00.400]   has Ukraine been in pushing back. They've made some success in the past couple of weeks in terms
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.920]   of breaking through some of the Soviet initial defensive lines. I think we have to see exactly
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:16.480]   how successful they've been. But what I would say is that there's no question that this is a conflict
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:23.360]   that we need to support and send a clear message, messages that have not been, as I said earlier,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:29.200]   sent it all clearly to Putin that, you know, this is a guy who has openly discussed the reassembling
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:39.280]   of the Soviet Union. And I have no, no illusions about the fact that this former KGBer thinks that
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.240]   the Soviet Union were the good old days. And if he thought he could get away with assembling as
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.920]   much of it as he possibly could, he would. And I think that we have to send a very clear message
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.400]   on that to him and a very clear message on that to China regarding authoritarian expansionism.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:04.960]   And this is where I think the Trump, DeSantis, Ramaswamy foreign policies are so hopelessly
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:12.640]   ill-informed and naive. The idea that we're going to go to Putin, who yesterday was sitting with
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:19.040]   Kim Jong-un, and persuade him, the better place is to be with us. Go away from your communist
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.800]   brothers in China and North Korea and come with us because it'll be a much better deal for you.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.960]   And that Donald Trump is going to do that in 24 hours or Vivek Ramaswamy is going to do it
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:36.400]   by virtue of his winning personality. I mean, to me, he looks like the guy you wanted to stuff in
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.360]   the locker in the 11th grade. But I don't think that's the guy who's going to persuade Vladimir
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:48.160]   Putin to leave the communist Chinese and to, you know, come to the America's side.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.400]   - But Governor, you have to admit the war is not going well for the Ukrainians. I mean,
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.880]   this counter offensive, here's what we were promised. Remember, just several months ago,
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.440]   before the counter offensive, you had people like Petraeus and Ben Hodges saying that the
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.640]   counter offensive would be like a blitz. They would rapidly penetrate the Serb-EUKIN lines.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.360]   They would march across the country to the Sea of Azov. They would cut off the land bridge to Crimea.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.840]   All this would happen within weeks, and it would be a significant Ukrainian victory. It has been
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   almost a total failure. The Ukrainians have taken even the Washington Post and Politico
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.480]   publications like that have said their losses have been staggering. The battlefield reports
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   have been sobering. These are our top blob publications saying this. So, we have been
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.720]   unsuccessful. Moreover, you say we should give them more weapons, but we've run out. We've run
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.640]   out of the key type of ammunition in this war, which is artillery shells. That's why we're giving
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:47.760]   them cluster bombs. We got the cupboard is bare. So, I'm just wondering, how exactly would you
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.880]   turn this around given that the Ukrainians are losing this war very badly? Well, first off,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.720]   there was a lot in there. All right, let's go back to the predictions from Petraeus and others. You
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:05.600]   didn't hear me making those predictions because I think anybody who was briefed on the deficiency
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.760]   of armaments for Ukraine would not have said something like that unless it was wishful
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:22.080]   thinking. Secondly, I understand the reports regarding our own deficiencies in providing them
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:29.920]   with more armaments. We have, I think, work to do with the rest of our allies in NATO in terms of
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:36.240]   they're providing more of the artillery and other armaments that are needed by the Ukrainians.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.880]   But the Europeans have even less than we do. I mean, you know...
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.240]   Well, but look, this is going to have to be something that we're going to have to
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:50.000]   cobble together to get it done. And it also shows what I was saying earlier in regards to the budget
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.040]   question that this massive military buildup that Donald Trump says he did was baloney.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.080]   I think you have an interesting point there, actually, which is to me one of the biggest
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:06.000]   surprises of this war is that we spend 877 billion on the Pentagon and that we could run out of ammo.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.880]   Right.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.160]   So, I mean, without blaming Trump per se or Biden, I just think we're getting ripped off.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.200]   I mean, the military industrial complex is royally screwing the American taxpayer. How can we spend
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.680]   877 billion dollars and not have ammo? Can you explain that to me?
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:27.120]   Or have food insecurity for a lot of members of the military, not have paid leave, not have
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.440]   healthcare. The idea that you don't want to look at that budget is an enormous...
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.480]   That's not what I said.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.440]   That is what you said.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.400]   No, it is not.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.320]   What did you say? You said you wouldn't touch it.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:45.200]   No, no, I did not say that. What I said was that the Pentagon has to be made more efficient and
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.600]   more effective with what it spends, but not reduce what it spends. And that goes right to the point
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.920]   that David just made, which is you have to get answers as president to the questions of what
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.800]   are you spending 877 billion dollars on if we're running out of ammo, and there's food insecurity,
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.560]   and there's not paid leave, right? So, what I was saying through the answer I gave you on the
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:19.440]   budget was I did not see that as a place to cut, but I did say very clearly that it's a place where
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:25.040]   we have to make the Pentagon more efficient and effective. And we need a Secretary of Defense
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.520]   and a president who want to demand answers to those questions first.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.240]   Are you not sympathetic to the idea that efficiency sometimes means spending less
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.680]   to get the same or more?
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.480]   If that's the conclusion we come to after examining it, then I'm very sympathetic to that.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.800]   So, then you are opening to cutting the defense budget.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:49.200]   I'm open. It is a secondary issue, the primary issue on defense.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.160]   No, I understand. I just want a clear answer so I understand where you're coming from. You
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.800]   want to look at the defense budget. You have an intuition that there's potentially
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.360]   extreme levels of waste.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:38:59.680]   Right.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.880]   And so, if you find that waste, will you just cut it?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.120]   No.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.480]   Or you just reallocate it?
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.120]   Reallocate.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.400]   Why?
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.640]   For the very reasons that David's just talking about. If we're running out of ammo,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.360]   if our submarine capacity is not where it should be, which I believe it is not,
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.480]   if our ship capacity is not where I believe it should be, and it is not in my view,
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:26.960]   and if our monetization of our Air Force is not where it should be, which I believe it is not,
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.600]   then you reallocate that money.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.840]   Okay, so there's a principle in capitalism called zero-based budgeting, which I
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.960]   actually like what you're saying, but just to kind of double-click on what that is.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.200]   Zero-based budgeting starts with the principle that you just started, which is,
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.600]   what are our priorities? What do we want to accomplish? And then you go and systematically
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   build up where the budget actually starts at zero dollars. Hey, Pentagon, you get zero,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.960]   not 800 billion. What do we need to accomplish? Oh, we need bullets? Okay, we need armaments?
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.880]   Okay, we need to have food security for all of our armed service men and women? Absolutely.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.600]   And then what happens if that number gets to 350 billion? Do you just cut half a billion,
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.480]   or do you find ways to spend the other half a trillion dollars?
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.760]   Well, I'm glad you brought that up, because that's what I did as governor.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.280]   I was the first governor who did zero-based budgeting, and I did it,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   first governor of New Jersey to do it, and I did it because of the dire straits that we were in.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.960]   I didn't think we could assume any longer anything in terms of our spending. So,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   I absolutely would want to take that approach. Now, I don't think you're going to go from 877
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:42.880]   billion to 350 billion and say that we've met all of our defense needs and the needs of our
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:49.840]   fighting men and women with that number. But let's just leave the number blank for a minute.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:57.520]   If I concluded that we could do everything we needed to do through the re-engineering
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:04.080]   of how we were spending in the Pentagon, and that ultimately it would check the boxes I
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.480]   want to check in terms of some of the issues I just talked about, and it turned out to be
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:17.600]   less than 877 billion, of course, I would look not to spend 877 billion. But that assumes a lot
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.920]   of things in there, as you know, but the principle of zero-based budgeting, from my perspective,
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:32.240]   worked when I was governor, not only in terms of keeping our spending at an increase of 2% a year
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:40.160]   annually for eight years, but it also educated me much more on the intricacies of the budget as the
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.680]   ultimate decision-maker. And I think that was useful. Chris, you were a very effective prosecutor,
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.760]   and part of that is having a good intuition. So I'm just going to ask you, your intuition,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:55.840]   how much waste do you think is in the military-industrial complex in that 877 billion?
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.120]   Do you think there's 30 cents of waste? Do you think there's 40 cents of waste? Do you think
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.760]   there's five cents of waste? Or do you think there's like 70 cents of waste? My intuition
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.000]   tells me that it is significant. I can't put a number on it. It'd be irresponsible for me to
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.400]   put a number on it. But there's no doubt that when you see us spend the 877 billion, and we don't
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:21.520]   have 155 millimeter artillery shells, that there's waste. Let's talk about governance and just like
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.440]   civil society and government for a second. But let's just finish on this military-industrial
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:36.160]   complex. Why is it? How does it come to be that so much corruption and graft gets introduced
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:42.640]   into the military budget? Explain just how it happens? How does all of this waste end up
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:48.720]   happening? Where on the one hand, you ask people, men and women, oftentimes poor, oftentimes
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.040]   minorities to come and serve and put their lives on the front lines. You don't even give them
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:59.520]   enough food. Somebody's clearly making money out of the 877 billion. Just explain how that waste
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:05.200]   comes to be. And the influence peddling and the revolving door just so that the average person
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.440]   can understand it. Well, first off, and I'll answer your question specifically, but let me say,
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:19.440]   by answering it this way, I don't want to imply in any way that this waste and corruption happens
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.280]   just in the military budget. Because it happens, it's been my experience, it happens across budgets,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:31.520]   across disciplines. With that being said, I would say it happens in a number of different ways.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.120]   First of all, not doing zero-based budgeting contributes to that because people no longer
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.480]   have to rationalize or justify the existence of a program. They just need to hire enough lobbyists
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:48.800]   to keep it getting put in there. So that's one way that it happens. Secondly, incompetence in
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:57.280]   administration. So people who are either purely incompetent in the job or alternative two is,
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:04.160]   are corrupt in the job. And so they look the other way on waste because they want to get a job
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:10.480]   through the revolving door you talked about on the other side. Third way that I think it happens
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:22.000]   is extraordinary events that cause political overreaction. So you'll have an extraordinary
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.360]   event that occurs from a national security perspective. And then politicians want to look
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:36.480]   like we're responding to it. And the way we're responding to it is we're going to spend x tens,
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:45.680]   hundreds of billions more on this broad category of initiatives without really digging into whether
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:52.000]   that can be spent effectively that way or not. And then once it gets in there, for the reasons I gave
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.240]   to you in the two examples before, it doesn't get out. So you layer it over and layer it over and
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.480]   layer it over and layer it over. And then that's the way that stuff happens. So I think it's a bit
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:14.400]   of a nutshell presentation on that for you. But I think those are the three most important elements
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:25.120]   that I've observed personally in governing a state with 60,000 employees and a $34 billion budget.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.760]   You think the antidote to that is a is to start with zero based budgeting? Or are there other more
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.600]   radical changes you would want to make, whether it's the CIA or the NSA? How do you think about
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.680]   getting to the root cause of or root answer of the truth?
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:45.840]   Look, I think that that there's two ways to do it initially. And zero based budgeting is one of them.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:56.640]   And secondly, is to try to select competent people for those positions, who understand clearly from
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   the leader, what their mission is,
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.360]   would you, for example, be willing to do an EO that said, if you serve in these roles,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.960]   you're banned from serving any of these folks for 20 years or something like that,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.840]   something that just makes it clear that there's no financial motivation,
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.240]   for somebody to walk out the door and then go and work for Lockheed Martin or
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.000]   just augment that let's talk about these former generals, like the ones we were quoting,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.800]   who predicted the counter offensive would be this wonderful success.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:27.120]   They're all now on the boards of weapons manufacturers. So the people in the Pentagon,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.640]   who make a lot of these procurement decisions about weapons systems,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:37.120]   when they retire, they go off to serve on these boards. I mean, the big weapons companies are
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.840]   basically their retirement program. I mean, that seems like a horrible set of incentives.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.800]   I mean, would you do something like ban the revolving door between
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   people working in the Pentagon and then working for a weapons company?
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:57.520]   - Well, I certainly would be willing to consider if they worked with a particular contractor,
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   they had supervisory or decision-making authority over a program run by a particular contractor,
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.440]   not being able to go back out and work for that contractor.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.880]   - But the problem isn't when they go back in, the problem is they know in advance that their
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.800]   retirement program is gonna be working on one of these boards. So they're not as tough as they
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.200]   should be when they're actually in the government job.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Tough problem.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.160]   - So you're talking about the revolving door on the way in or the way out?
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.880]   - No, I'm talking about on the way out. Like basically you work your way up to general,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.000]   and then you retire, and then you join the boards of these Raytheon and Lockheed and all these guys.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.160]   - Well, I think that there are appropriate restrictions that can be put on in terms of
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.520]   number of years to make it go past the period when that person could have direct political
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:43.040]   influence on the administration that's in play. But I also think we need to be careful about the
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:50.320]   fact that we don't wind up throwing out the baby with the bathwater in the sense that
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:58.160]   there are some people who are legitimate people who are not looking to do it in a way that is
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:04.640]   corrupt or unethical, but who develop great expertise in certain areas. And that expertise
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.360]   can be very helpful. We're only looking at the negative side of it. So I think there are ways
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.920]   to do what we need to do with the political influence, and that it would be to ban it for
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.920]   the rest of that administration. So if you serve in a particular administration, for the rest of
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.680]   that administration, you can't go back out and work on the issues that you were working on when
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.640]   you were there. That to me just seems to be reasonable. I don't know whether 20 years makes
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:39.440]   sense or not. But we've identified the problem. Now let's figure out how to fix it. I'm willing
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:46.080]   and open to do that, but I want to make sure I do it in a way that is not creating a whole
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:52.320]   different set of problems that we'll then be talking about. And the analogy I make in part on
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:49:02.080]   this is the wall between CIA and FBI and the problems that that I think precipitated regarding
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:09.200]   9/11. So, you know, there are fixes to these things. And I'm telling you guys is I'm willing
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:16.240]   to be open about how to do it. I favor the concept. I think we're negotiating over length of
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.720]   years and how it applies. Should that be the case for all government administrative jobs, Governor?
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:28.400]   Sure. So FDA into healthcare, healthcare into FDA, USDA, like, should that be the case everywhere?
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.640]   It's the same principle. Yeah. How should that then be applied to Congress people?
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:39.920]   Well, since the EO won't cover members of Congress in the same way that that's why they don't have
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.480]   term limits, which I believe they should have. And why none of this stuff will ever apply to
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   Congress. So let's tell the truth. It'll never apply to Congress because they'd have to pass
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:57.120]   it for it to apply. And it will never happen. But the president could do what he could do about his
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:02.000]   branch of government and should, and I would. Let's pivot to one of the most controversial
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.640]   topics between the two parties, which is immigration. And I'll pull up two charts
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:13.520]   here to queue up the discussion. Here's the first chart. Just since 2000, we've been,
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:19.440]   net migration United States just on a steady stream down at around 5 million. Second chart
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:24.880]   is border crossings. That orange line there that you're seeing, that's COVID. And then the blue
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.240]   line obviously is the return from COVID. But the border agency seems to think not much has changed
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:35.440]   over the last couple of years at the border. However, we have and that's across obviously
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:42.000]   multiple administrations. Other countries have point based systems, they have very logical
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.760]   discussions over immigration. Is this person going to add and be a creative to the society?
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.560]   Is this person going to be a drain on society? And, you know, they just UK, Australia, New Zealand,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:58.960]   countless countries now use this point based system. It's incredibly polarized here. And we
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.720]   have the lowest, we have the lowest unemployment of our lifetime, plenty of jobs, we still have 1.6
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:12.720]   jobs per American who is who are looking for jobs. I'm curious why you think this immigration
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:21.680]   discussion is so polarized, and not factual, and how you as president would resolve this issue,
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   and maybe make it make more sense to the American public.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.760]   Well, look, I think the first thing the first part of the question is, how has it gotten so
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.080]   polarized? And I think it's because people in political life have used this as a weapon
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:46.800]   on both sides of the aisle to try to promote their own political agendas. Democrats have wanted
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:54.320]   this perception on their positive side from their perspective, that they'll let anybody in because
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:00.720]   they think ultimately, those folks who come in will be their voters, ultimately, over the long
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:07.680]   haul. And they also want to raise restrictions, they want to raise the issue of restrictions
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:15.760]   that are placed by Republicans on this, to make us seem to be heartless, uncaring, unfeeling people.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:26.640]   On our side, we want to make the entire system seem completely lawless, because that plays into
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:31.920]   our view of ourselves as the law and order party and the Democrats as the party who could give a
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:38.400]   damn about law and order. And we want to play into the populist side of it, which says that
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:44.720]   any person who comes over the border is likely to take your job, not just a job, your job.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:51.520]   And then when you present it to people that way, they of course, are going to be anti-immigration,
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.720]   because they'd like to keep their job and support their family and have a life that they want to
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:05.440]   look forward to, and for their kids as well. So, that's my explanation on the first part as to how
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.400]   we got here. Seems logical, yeah. And fair, by the way. Your assessment of both parties, by the way,
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:16.240]   on these topics, I think is excellent. By the way, completely unfair way to have conducted this
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:22.800]   stuff. The problem has been that we haven't had presidential leadership on this issue since Reagan.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:31.280]   Reagan ultimately, and I think he learned this as a conservative governor in a blue state,
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:38.080]   where he had to deal with Jesse Unruh running his legislature. And Reagan, it's all front of
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:46.400]   mind because I just finished writing a book on Reagan, so it's fresh in mind to me. Reagan learned
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:56.720]   that it was only he, the governor, who could force people into a room to get issues resolved.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:04.560]   In the same way, when he was president, he didn't love the deal he made on immigration,
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:11.920]   same way he didn't love the deal he made on social security, but he liked it more than he liked the
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:18.240]   alternative of doing nothing. I think the only way we're going to resolve the immigration issue,
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:24.960]   Jason, is to have a president, as I said in response to David Friedberg's earlier question
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:32.320]   on debt, a president who's willing to sacrifice some popularity to try to force a resolution.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:40.480]   And I do think that most Americans would support a merit-based immigration system.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.560]   Why does it never come up? I mean, these other countries have had such great success with it,
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.200]   why won't any politician say it? I haven't heard you say it in the debates. I don't know if you
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.000]   have, I haven't heard everything you've said, but... They didn't even ask us about immigration
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.320]   in the debates. They didn't ask us about immigration, entitlements, or the debt.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:02.000]   Three things we've already talked about here today, but they had time to ask me about UFOs.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.360]   Yeah, that was pretty bizarre. They're like, "Hey, let's give you the most meaningless question
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.640]   of anybody in the debate." Governor, that's what the base wants to hear. Come on.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.360]   Yeah. Wrap it up for us, Governor. Let's talk about UFOs. I mean...
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.920]   What did you think of the ending of secession, Governor? Go.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:24.400]   Yeah, I mean, it's like... So, I have talked about it in my town hall meetings about
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:32.160]   Republicans should be advocating for a merit-based immigration system. But we need to also recognize,
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:40.480]   while I think both parties should be in favor of a secure southern border,
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:47.520]   if for no other reason than the fentanyl and drug-related issues that are involved.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:53.280]   Why is there such a debate over the numbers? Because I just pulled up those numbers,
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.720]   and that's the Border Patrol, and that's across multiple administrations. And then people are
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.840]   saying... You're living in some kind of simulation, Jason. Did you see the Washington Post
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:05.360]   just last week? The headline is, "Families crossing U.S. border illegally reached all-time
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.560]   high in August." This is the Washington Post. Oh, you trust the Washington Post now?
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:17.760]   I'm saying that if a liberal Democrat publication that serves the DC blob is
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:23.440]   admitting this problem, why can't you admit it? Oh, I'm not saying that it's not at all-time
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.800]   highs, but it doesn't seem to have gotten much different than over the last two administrations.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.280]   Do you want to act like it's not a serious problem?
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.080]   No, no, I don't, actually.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.760]   I promise you I'm not worried about my job.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.560]   I brought it up at...
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:40.240]   I'm worried about the fact that the United States can't absorb a million migrants a year.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.600]   That's my question. Obviously, I care about it. So don't tell me I don't care about it.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.720]   I'm just fact-checking that.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.840]   It's fine to fact-check, but even though it's at all-time highs, if you look at that chart,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.680]   it seems like there's a big debate on the numbers that, hey, it may be at all-time highs,
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.640]   but it's been relatively the same. And so that's what I'm trying to get at,
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.040]   Governor. Why can't we get good numbers on this?
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:06.080]   Well, we do get good numbers on it, but everybody slices the numbers differently.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:13.040]   You know, I used to work in a deli when I was in high school for a period of time,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:20.000]   and, you know, everybody had the same big chunk of bologna, but depending on how you sliced it,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:29.680]   it looked different. And so I agree with David that it is a very serious problem right now,
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:38.080]   and it's because of Biden's policies and his rhetoric. He sent a very clear signal during
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:46.720]   the 2020 campaign, "If I win, the border's open. Let's go. Everybody come on in." And it has caused
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   a crisis in a number of levels. Also, Democratic politicians saying that they were willing to be
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:58:00.480]   sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. Well, now I see the front page of the New York Post every day,
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:09.120]   and here's Eric Adams complaining that he needs help. He needs help. Well, you should have shut
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:16.080]   up and not said you were a sanctuary city, and then you wouldn't need the help. But it's easy.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:21.280]   Did you see the video yesterday? He said in all his time in New York, he's always seen an end to
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:26.320]   every problem. There's always a solution. He says, "I have not seen, I cannot see an end to this
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.600]   problem. I don't see a solution." Yeah. I might be paraphrasing a bit.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.880]   You just broke Jason's heart. You were his perfect candidate until that answer.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:38.800]   No, no, no. I'm in favor of the point-based system, have been very consistent about that.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.480]   I think we should actually have a thoughtful discussion of how many people we can actually
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.320]   bring in and sustain. That's the obvious discussion. Well, I think we all agree on
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:50.000]   merit-based. We all agree on merit-based immigration. The thing that I have an issue
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.080]   with, Jason, is just you pretend like the border's not in crisis. It is in crisis.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:59:02.400]   Oh, yeah. I think it hasn't been resolved for decades. I mean, we have not had a solution
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.560]   there. When's the last time the border was functional, I guess?
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.480]   Well, Trump at least had a remain in Mexico policy, and then Biden revoked it, and now
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.080]   they're thinking about bringing it back because they have no way to control the huge number of
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.680]   people who are streaming across. Yeah. I'm just trying to advocate for a point-based system.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:22.080]   By the way, on the numbers, that's what should be part of a negotiation between Republicans
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:29.600]   and Democrats in Congress and the White House based upon the current circumstances. We can't
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:34.720]   deal with all the stuff that's happened before, but what we know now is we have current circumstances
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:43.920]   now, guys, which are not only impacting quality of life in terms of crime and quality of life
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.400]   in terms of education because you see what's going to happen in the New York school system.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:56.960]   You are going to have thousands of immigrant children who now are going to show up at the
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:06.160]   New York City public schools to be educated. That's why the uncontrolled part of what David
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.520]   Sachs is talking about is so vital right now. And thirdly, but most importantly to me,
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:20.000]   is the fentanyl issue because when you have 110,000 people dying of overdoses last year
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.200]   in this country, and you have overdose being the number one killer of men between 18 and 34,
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.520]   it is a crisis. And it is a crisis which is not created entirely by the border,
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.080]   but is contributed to mightily by what's going on at the border.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.200]   Would you send, there's been talk of this, I think, from certain candidates, would you send
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.240]   troops into Mexico to take out the cartels or is that crazy?
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.560]   No, I would not. I would put National Guard at the border to work with Customs and Border Patrol
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:01.680]   to stop the fentanyl cartels from getting in to our country. And I would use our intelligence
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:08.720]   community to do what we always do with enemies of that nature, which is to target them and to
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.320]   make sure that if they're going to do what they're going to do, that they're dealt with.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.760]   But in terms of a Ron DeSantis full-scale invasion of Mexico, yeah, I think I'd probably demur on
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.200]   that one. So you'd whack these people, bring in the fentanyl and you just wouldn't do it?
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.880]   On the soil in Mexico.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:31.600]   Correct. And also, and I'd whack them within the laws of the United States.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.160]   It would not be a vigilante system where everybody goes down there and just starts
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.600]   popping somebody they think is a fentanyl dealer as they come over the border.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:47.680]   But what I would also say to you is we've got to also make sure we deal with this
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.200]   diplomatically with the Mexicans. And by diplomatically, I mean, not like being nice,
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.920]   through very hard negotiations with them, to say to the Mexican president,
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:06.320]   you are importing precursor chemicals from China into your country to make fentanyl
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.040]   with the sole purpose of profiting from and killing Americans.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.080]   That's not something we're going to tolerate.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.000]   So you wouldn't send Fioreo? We got it.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.360]   I mean, we do it the smart way, not the way that lets you pound your chest and pretend you're a
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.160]   television tough guy.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.240]   Let me double click on that since you brought up fentanyl. We have this crisis here in San
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.720]   Francisco, open air drug market, cheapest fentanyl you can get. Plus we give subsidies if you come
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.240]   here and you're a fentanyl addict, we pay for you to come here. Essentially, it's absolute chaos.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.440]   We keep getting promises in San Francisco that we're going to turn it around and we're going
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.840]   to take it seriously. It never happens. Given that, is there not a case for the feds coming in
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.880]   and cracking down on the fentanyl trade here? And if you were president, would you come in and
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.800]   usurp the local authorities and just take out all these crazy open air drug markets in some
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.000]   cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco? I actually said that in the debate. What I would do
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.280]   would be to instruct the attorney general to instruct the US attorneys in the cities with
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:17.760]   these kind of problems that we are taking over the prosecution of violent and drug crime in
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.120]   those cities. If the prosecutors on the state level are unwilling to do it, the US attorneys
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.480]   have the laws on the federal books to do it. We have the rooms of the federal prisons and we will
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.760]   police these cities until they get their act together. You just got a couple million votes
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.160]   in California because people here are fed up with the locals. Governor, can I just push back on that?
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.120]   I recently started reading the Federalist Papers again, sacks, I don't know when you last reviewed
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.200]   them. And I'm just struck by how so much of our modern political rhetoric is driven by what the
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:55.280]   federal government will do for you on a national basis, a state basis, and now even a local basis.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.840]   Is that really the role of the federal government? No, or should each state and each city ultimately
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.400]   decide what the hell kind of city they want to build what they want to live in, and then deal
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.880]   with the consequences and let the federal government become responsible for the things
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.840]   that were defined in our constitution and that the Constitutional Republic was meant to set out
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.400]   to do for the federal government, rather than use the federal government as a hammer to smash
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:25.520]   all nails everywhere, at some point the hammer is going to break. So let me answer the question,
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:32.800]   which is no, it's not the role of the federal government to do it. Unless the discord and the
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.320]   inability of the states to deal with an issue begins to affect the entire country. And I believe
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:47.440]   that this failure, and it's by the way, it's a planned failure, David. This is the Soros group
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:55.360]   going around and electing these completely liberal prosecutors who say, "No, I'm not gonna
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:01.200]   prosecute these crimes anymore." It begins to affect the very nature of the entire country.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.280]   If we don't have functional cities, David, we can't have a functional country. And so no,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.040]   I would do this only because I think by the time I get there in January of 25,
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:20.080]   we are going to be at last resort world. Now, if in the interim between now and January of 25,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.960]   the discord in places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and others
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.000]   got so bad that the citizens there rose up and demanded something different
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.640]   and the states and cities started to respond to it, I have no interest in doing this unless we are
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.960]   the law enforcers of last resort. And so philosophically, I completely agree with you,
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:51.440]   but we're now in a situation where when I was in New York City all day yesterday,
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.000]   it is the worst I've seen New York City since the late '70s.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.680]   I agree, yeah.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.160]   And I was old enough then to go in, I was a high school student in the late '70s,
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.520]   and go into the city and my parents used to be petrified if I insisted on going into New York
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.640]   to go to a basketball game or a hockey game. The walk from the Port Authority bus terminal
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:23.520]   on 41st and 8th to Madison Square Garden on 33rd and 8th was an absolute youthful education
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:31.680]   on drugs and porn and violent crime. So I agree with you philosophically on that,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:37.280]   but I think in the instance we're in right now, this is what we'd have to do in order to get it
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.960]   back under control. And so I'm not thrilled about it, but I think it's absolutely necessary.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.840]   In the United States, we have somewhere between two and three million Americans incarcerated,
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:52.880]   one of the highest per capita incarceration rates of any country in the world.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:07:00.800]   And a lot of this justice reform movement arose from what are considered to be very deep inequities
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:09.120]   in the imprisonment of American citizens for various petty crimes, misdemeanors that turn
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.880]   into felonies that turn into three strikes that turn into spending your life in prison.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.120]   And that obviously, there's a big racial divide and how this affects the population.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.480]   And from that movement arose this effort to try and address the social inequities and how the
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:29.360]   prison system has become to some an extension or the follow on to America's toward history with
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   slavery. What is your point of view, then? Do we have inequities in the prison system in how we
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.640]   address crime in this country? And if so, what would the right path have been looking back now
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.000]   at the efforts and the dollars that have gone into trying to solve this problem through
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.440]   decriminalization that has obviously led to massive problems in inner cities? Is it a problem,
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.640]   the criminalization in this country, the incarceration in this country? And if so,
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.480]   what's the right path to addressing it? And obviously, you have an intimate history here.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.880]   So you would know this better than most that we would talk to.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.080]   Look, I think it is a problem. And let me tell you what I did as governor.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.000]   We did criminal justice reform in New Jersey, and we did it in a bipartisan way. And this is
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:19.360]   what we did. I thought that the biggest problem we had in New Jersey was our state constitution
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:27.760]   required. It was a shall issue state on bail. Everyone was entitled to bail under our constitution.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:35.760]   And the only factor that could be taken into account constitutionally, David, was risk of
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:42.080]   flight. So if you had a rap sheet as long as my arm and your arm put together, that could not
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.240]   be considered by a judge in whether or not to grant bail or not, nor could the nature of the
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.760]   violence you committed in those acts. I saw that as an enormous problem. I agreed with Democrats
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.960]   that on a lot of these minor drug crimes, and I don't mean dealing crimes, I mean possession crimes
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:09.120]   with addicts being arrested for small amounts of possession, that we had become a debtor's
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:16.320]   prison in New Jersey. That if somebody couldn't afford the 500 bucks for the minimum bail,
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:23.440]   which was usually $5,000, they spent more time in county and state prison than they ever would
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.840]   have spent if they'd just pled guilty and been allowed to plead guilty and get sentenced. So
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:39.040]   the deal we made was this. On certain defined non-violent crimes, I would agree to the state
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:47.520]   law allowing release on people's own recognizance. In return, the Democrats would amend our
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.640]   constitution to make it a may issue state on bail and to add dangerousness to the community
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.120]   as a factor to be considered in granting bail or not. What's happened since then? Crime in New
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:10.880]   Jersey is down since we did this. We closed two state prisons and we have not had any spike in
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:17.120]   violent crime like you've seen in New York since then because we did it smartly and in a way that
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:25.200]   was balanced. And what you've also seen is 98% of the people released on their own recognizance
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:31.440]   have shown back up for their court hearings. So we're not having some people running around
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:38.960]   and jumping the ROR release that they've gotten. And I took one of the two state prisons we closed
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:46.800]   and turned it into a drug treatment prison so that folks who had documented drug and alcohol
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.680]   addictions while in prison were able to go for the concluding parts of their term
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:01.040]   to this secondary prison to get, which is fully secure, and they were detained,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.480]   but they also got drug and alcohol treatment while they were in there. And what we've seen with that
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.960]   is we've seen recidivism drop among those people who've gone through that program
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.880]   by nearly 40%. There are ways we can do this without having the results New York has had
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:25.360]   through their ridiculous criminal justice reform. We can do it the right way across the whole
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   country. Have you seen other states follow New Jersey's leader or New Jersey's model?
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.560]   I have seen a couple of other states that have done it. I don't think anybody's done it as well
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:46.560]   as we did it. And imagine this, a Republican governor got support from the PBA and the FOP
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:53.200]   for that reform, so from law enforcement professionals, and got an A+ from the ACLU.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:12:02.160]   Now, when you can get both of those, it's kind of hard to get that done. And I think we've gotten
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   it done, and we just had a, at my policy institute, we just had a seminar on this from people from
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:16.320]   the public defenders to private criminal defense lawyers, prosecutors, and cops all on a panel,
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.520]   and not one of them had an objection to criminal justice reform in New Jersey.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:28.560]   And this is now nearly 10 years after we did it. So I think there are ways to do this. Unfortunately,
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:35.600]   a lot of people don't want to have a long-form conversation on criminal justice reform.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.320]   They want to have either the Joe Biden approach from when he was in the Senate,
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:45.520]   mandatory minimums for everybody, throw everybody in the can, three strikes, you're out,
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:52.560]   all that stuff. Or they want to have the George Soros conversation, you know, where nobody who
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.560]   commits a crime really meant to do it, and all jail is unfair. Both of those are dead wrong.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.520]   - Governor, you mentioned the FBI briefly before. One of the revelations that came out during the
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:10.640]   Twitter files is that we had 80 FBI agents monitoring American social media accounts
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:18.560]   and submitting takedown requests to Twitter. This is pre-Elon Twitter, and presumably many other
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.520]   big tech companies, because I'm sure they weren't just doing this with Twitter.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:27.520]   What business is it of the FBI to be monitoring and censoring Americans? Do you think there's
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.880]   any justification for that? What is your view of that? - I think the only reason to monitor
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:39.280]   those kind of things would be for terrorist information. And I think that would be reasonable
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:46.800]   to do. But I don't think for any other reason, other than terrorist activity, domestic or foreign,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.400]   I think the FBI has a right to do that. And I think it's the right thing to do.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.280]   But I don't think under any other circumstances, David, they should be doing that.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.240]   - Are you willing to say to Chris Wray, as I understand it, you recommended Chris Wray for
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:08.240]   the position many years ago, and I think you're a fan of his. Are you willing to say to him,
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:14.320]   "Knock this off. You should not be involved in censoring American social media accounts."
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.720]   - I'm willing to say to Chris exactly what I just said to you. And by the way,
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.000]   I've known Chris long enough. I mean, we were in the Bush Justice Department together
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.360]   starting back at nine, right in the immediate post-9/11 period. So I've known Chris now for
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.240]   22 years. I will say exactly what I think to Chris and will instruct him appropriately
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.600]   with the Attorney General. And let me just make a point, David, since you brought that up.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:47.120]   I don't think presidents should be involved in the criminal investigatory activity of the
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:55.200]   Department of Justice in any way. And so you should set policies that say like that, you know,
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:02.640]   your work should be restricted on monitoring just domestic or international terrorism.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:09.520]   But you shouldn't be commenting in any way on what they're doing from a criminal investigatory
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.280]   perspective. I think that started in the Obama years with Eric Holder. When you appoint your
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.440]   wingman Attorney General, I guess that's what happens. And the fact is that it's continued
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.520]   through the Trump years and now through the Biden years. And my instruction to my Attorney General
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.400]   will be the same as it was, because in New Jersey, we don't elect Attorney General, we appoint them
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.040]   like you do in the federal system. And what I said to each of my attorneys general was,
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.960]   I know I was the US Attorney for seven years, I got expertise and opinions on criminal prosecution,
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:47.840]   I'm never going to call you ever. And I never did. Because once you decide to be a political figure,
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.680]   and not a law enforcement figure, you should stay out of criminal investigations.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.840]   So I know you didn't ask it. But it struck me when you were talking about that.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.520]   Governor, let me ask you one last question from my end, which is why are you running for president?
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:07.120]   Recent polling data show the 52% unfavorable rating 23% favorable, and you're three and a
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.320]   half percent in the average of the national polls. What's the goal here? Help us understand how you
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:18.080]   think about the campaign and how you think about your future as a political operator and what your
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:24.000]   goal is with the campaign. My goal is to be President of the United States. And since I've
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.720]   been doing this for a while, I don't pay attention to national polls, because we don't have a national
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.160]   primary. And in fact, we don't have a national general election. What we have is 50 individual
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.640]   state elections. That's the way we nominate candidates. And if you look at the most recent
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:44.480]   poll in New Hampshire, I'm in second place in New Hampshire at 14%. Ahead of Ron DeSantis,
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:51.440]   ahead of Vivek, ahead of Nikki, ahead of Pence, and behind only Trump. And now I'm behind by 20
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:17:00.480]   points. I'll give you that. But I'm behind a guy who's only at 34% in that poll. And so I absolutely
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:06.240]   believe I can win New Hampshire. And I believe if I win New Hampshire, David, then the whole race
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.680]   changes. You have a line there. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So let's start off with I'm running because I want
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.560]   to be President of the United States. Yeah. And that's the only reason to run. I think I don't
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:24.320]   need to run to become famous. I'm famous enough. I don't need to run to get a book deal,
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.720]   because you know what? I've already written two books and my third one's getting ready to come
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.880]   out. I don't need it to get a job on TV. I gave that up to run for President. So I'm running for
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.720]   President to be President, David. And that's why I'm doing it, and for no other reason.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.000]   Should Donald Trump be in jail?
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.440]   We'll find out when these trials happen.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.480]   What do you think?
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.920]   I'm willing to give everybody the presumption of innocence because that's what the Constitution
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.440]   demands that I do. Do I think that he can...
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.600]   What's your prosecutorial intuition?
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.200]   I would have indicted both federal cases. I would not have indicted the New York case
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.000]   or the Atlanta case as to Donald Trump. I think on the New York case, the Manhattan DA
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.600]   has much more important work to be doing than bringing a case on a seven-year-old payment
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.800]   to a porn star that he was having an affair with to keep it from the American people after the
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.800]   American people already know everything they need to know about it. So I think that was useless and
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:27.840]   purely political. In the Atlanta case, once Jack Smith indicted Trump on election interference
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:34.640]   federally, I know that Fannie Willis was probably very upset that she had been investigating it for
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:39.280]   two and a half years and he beat her to the punch, but he beat her to the punch. And there's no
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:46.240]   reason to indict somebody for the same acts twice. And so I wouldn't have indicted him in Atlanta.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:54.160]   I would have indicted him for sure on the documents case, but I will tell you since you asked,
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.400]   I wouldn't have indicted him on the documents. I would have just indicted him on the obstruction
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.840]   of justice and the lying. I think by indicting on the documents, he just made it a much more
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.200]   complicated case that may not get to trial for a year and a half or two because of the classified
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.240]   documents involved. And I would have indicted him on the January 6th case because I believe his
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:23.760]   activity from election night forward is worthy of the probable cause standard. Now we'll see
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:30.560]   if the government can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt on both those cases. I will tell you.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.320]   But on those cases that you would bring, that you would indict as a prosecutor,
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.400]   what sentence would you seek? Because these Democrat prosecutors are seeking over 500 years
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.120]   of jail time for Trump. I mean, what do you think the appropriate punishment to seek is?
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:50.720]   David, that's just the statutory number. It's not whatever is done. And people do that all the time.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.440]   They look at the statutory maximum. They add up each count in the statutory maximum and they come
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:01.680]   up to 500. It never happens. And it's never asked for. And it's never asked for. What you do is-
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.720]   If you were the prosecutor, what punishment would you be seeking?
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:12.560]   I don't think that it makes any sense for Donald Trump to go to jail. And it's not just because
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:19.360]   he's Donald Trump. It has more to do quite frankly with the fact that he'd probably be 79 years old
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:25.680]   before he'd be ready to go to jail. And when I was prosecuting cases, I really felt like when you get
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:31.520]   to that age and you send someone into the atmosphere that federal prison is, even the minimum security
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:36.960]   federal prison, that you're essentially giving them a death sentence. And unless they've done
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:44.560]   something, like Bernie Madoff, for instance, which is worthy of a death sentence, then I would not
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:52.000]   think that sending him to jail would be appropriate. Now, a judge may feel differently.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.360]   And in the end, all the prosecutor does is make a recommendation. The judge makes a decision.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:03.120]   If I were president of the United States, while I would not consider pardoning Donald Trump
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.520]   if he were convicted, unless the trial for some reason showed itself to have unconstitutionally
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:16.000]   unfair elements that were not corrected by the courts, other than that, I wouldn't pardon him.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.720]   But if he were sentenced to jail, I certainly would consider commuting the sentence
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.960]   for the reasons I just said. Let's talk about what happened on January 6th for a second.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.640]   A lot of folks in the Republican Party are framing it as like, you know, a day out at the park. And
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:38.000]   we just saw Trump appointed judges give the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys sentences,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:45.120]   multi-decade sentences for seditious conspiracy. Do you think these sentences that have been handed
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.040]   down by Trump appointed judges are part of a deep state conspiracy against the Republicans? Or do
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.440]   you think these people are domestic terrorists and that they got appropriate sentences?
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.960]   You know, I don't want to, Jason, give an answer on each one of the cases because I quite frankly
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.880]   could tell you that I haven't followed the cases, each one of them closely enough.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.000]   You just did on the other four.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.600]   To give an opinion, pardon me?
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.800]   You just did on the other four, though.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:16.400]   I don't know. There were no, you're asking me about, that was the Trump cases.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.440]   Yeah, yeah. So now I'm asking about this.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.640]   And I'm talking about, and I said that because of his age.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.760]   Okay.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.240]   All right? And so none of these folks on the Proud Boys, I think were in their 70s.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.440]   Okay.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.360]   So that's the difference between the two. But I'm gonna try to answer your question.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:31.600]   Great.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.920]   I just don't want to say I'm giving an opinion as to each and every sentence.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.800]   Okay.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:43.760]   What I want to say about it, though, is that what they did on January 6th was unlawful,
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.800]   it was extremely serious, and it requires imprisonment.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.320]   Okay.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:54.800]   And so each of these individual cases have nuances and individual facts to them
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.080]   that I'm not, I will tell you, I'm not completely conversant in.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:58.880]   Okay.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.160]   So the difference between a 15-year sentence and an 18-year sentence or a 22-year sentence,
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.240]   if I sat down and I delved into what was presented at trial and what was presented
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.360]   in the sentencing memoranda, I'd give you an opinion.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.720]   But I haven't done that. I have to be honest.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:19.840]   Can I ask one final question? From my perspective, one of the reasons that
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:28.160]   the polling can sometimes veer this way is that in the Republican polls, a lot of the attacks
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.640]   against you, Governor, focus on, obviously, Bridgegate and Beachgate, and then this kind of
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:41.040]   theoretical corruption allegations directed at you and your staff.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.840]   Now, your staff was convicted of wire fraud, but then the Supreme Court overturned it 9-0.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.800]   Right.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.520]   And now what they said, though, was that there was corruption, but there wasn't corruption
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.360]   to try to get money, which is why the wire fraud, I think that's what Elaina Kagan said
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.280]   in the ruling, the majority ruling, it was, and it was 9-0. So it was very, very clear that
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:06.080]   the DOJ just kind of took, again, to your case, talking about Trump, the wrong charges almost,
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.920]   okay, and what they did was not illegal, even if what they did may have been illegal under a
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:15.600]   different statute. In any event, it would be great for you to set the record on Bridgegate
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.640]   and Beachgate.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.800]   We're really calling Beachgate?
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.040]   Well, I'm just calling out what the press...
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.160]   Like, really?
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.520]   Well, I think what people got upset was, and I'm just going to repeat this, I don't have an issue
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.680]   with this, is there was a state beach that was closed, and there was pictures of you and your
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.920]   family on that beach when everybody else was told to stay at home. That's, I guess that's what
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.640]   people point to. I'm just giving you that, just say, just address it however you want, so you can
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   be definitive in your own language.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:49.760]   All right, so let's deal with the beach situation. Every beach in New Jersey that day was open,
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:57.600]   except for one. Every beach in New Jersey. So the idea that people across the state of New Jersey
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.160]   were kept off the beach that day, and me and my family were the only people on the beach,
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:10.480]   is completely wrong. So everybody who wanted to go to the beach that day could go to the beach
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.520]   somewhere in New Jersey, except for the state park, and the reason the state park was closed
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:22.080]   was because the legislature did not send me a budget in time. If they'd sent me a budget,
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.920]   I would have signed it, and the beach would have been open. They refused to send me a budget.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:32.320]   Now, having said that factually, contextually, it was a mistake for me to go on the beach.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:40.800]   Now, I told everybody when the budget standoff was going on that my family was going to be at
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:46.240]   that house, and they were going to go on the beach, but we were not going to use any services,
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.320]   lifeguards or garbage service or anything else, because it wouldn't be open. So I told everybody
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:59.360]   that up front. I shouldn't have gone out there myself because I was the governor. It was a
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:05.440]   mistake. I went out there and spent an hour with my family. It was a mistake. I heartily think it
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.800]   merits a gate. - Yeah, I wouldn't give it a gate.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.000]   - A kerfuffle, maybe. - And I would heartily call it
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.560]   corruption, okay? - Yeah, no, it's not corruption.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:23.360]   - On bridge gate. Let's remember, this has been investigated by a democratic state legislature
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:31.600]   with subpoena power, by a democratic US attorney with an ax to grind, for me, with subpoena power,
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:43.120]   and in both of those, and also an investigation that we authorized internally. All three of the
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.480]   investigations agreed on one thing. I had no knowledge of what happened. No one told me what
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:55.520]   was going on, and I didn't find out about it until well after the fact. And nobody's ever
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.240]   disputed that who's done an investigation. And if they thought I'd done something wrong,
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.680]   given the ridiculous indictments they brought, I'm sure they would have thrown me in there too
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.920]   if they had anything they could have gone with. These were three employees
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:17.920]   who did something extraordinarily stupid, and they should have been fired, and they were.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.480]   As soon as I found out about it, they were all fired. They should never work in public office
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:31.920]   again. But what they did was stupid, not criminal. And if we start criminalizing every time someone
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:38.320]   does something stupid, we won't have enough jails. And when you get Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:45.200]   and Clarence Thomas to agree on an overreach by the Department of Justice, it was a politically
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:51.440]   motivated prosecution because I had just been reelected with 61% of the vote in a blue state
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.800]   and was ahead of Hillary Clinton by eight points in national polls.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.400]   That's why they did it. They thought they were going to get me.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:05.920]   They cooperated the guy who admits he was the mastermind of the situation. They cooperated
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:12.320]   him to try to get me. And once they realized they couldn't get me, they had to indict somebody.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:18.160]   So, they indicted the two other people. I believe you. I think that the DOJ engages in a lot of
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.800]   political prosecutions. Why isn't Jack Smith's prosecution politically minded? And the point
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:29.440]   I'll come back to is that Merrick Garland did this analysis when he first came in on whether
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.080]   Trump was guilty of incitement on January 6th. And they had like a memo come back saying,
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.360]   "Sorry, we can't get him for that." There was then a leak in the Washington Post from Biden himself
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.160]   saying that he thought Merrick Garland was being kind of wimpy and that they should go after Trump.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.880]   And then lo and behold, Merrick Garland appoints Jack Smith to go get Trump.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.640]   And Jack Smith's case depends on knowing the inner workings of Trump's mind,
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:58.000]   this like fraud on the American people idea that he not only made up this stolen election narrative,
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.840]   but he knew it was false, which I don't see how they're ever going to prove beyond a reasonable
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:08.480]   doubt. So, why isn't that a political prosecution? I mean, Biden clearly wanted it. He instigated it
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.560]   through a leak to the Washington Post, or at least that seems to be the chronology,
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.800]   whether it was deliberate or not. And it requires Jack Smith to prove this impossible
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.760]   theory because it requires knowing what Trump was really thinking when he was saying all this stuff.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.160]   All right.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.120]   So, how is that not an equally political prosecution?
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.000]   All right. So, let me separate the two. So, you're talking just about Jan 6th,
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   not about the classified documents.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.160]   Correct. I'm just talking about the Jack Smith theory that Trump perpetrated a fraud because
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.360]   he knew his stolen election narrative was false.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.600]   Well, look, I think that there is going to be a lot of interesting testimony
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:49.760]   that will be given in that case regarding what Donald Trump really knew and what he really
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.240]   thought, what he was telling people at the time. And I don't think it's as clear cut as you're
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:59.280]   making it out to be. Now, what I said at the time when he brought the Jan 6th case is,
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:04.800]   it is aggressive. There's no question it's an aggressive prosecution.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:11.280]   Do I believe it's political? I don't know, but I will say it's aggressive. It's much more
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:18.960]   aggressive than the classified documents case because you're exactly right that state of mind,
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.360]   which is a part of every criminal case, will be a part of this one. And trying to get inside
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.360]   Donald Trump's mind is a dangerous thing because he says so many contradictory things, right?
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:37.040]   So he was saying to me during debate prep in 2020 that he was absolutely convinced
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:43.920]   that he could lose this election. Not that it would be stolen, that he could lose it
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:49.360]   because of COVID and COVID ruined his great economy and now he's going to lose.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.120]   So he said a lot of different things to a lot of different people over time.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:01.840]   And all I'd say, David, is that it is going to be an aggressive case to prove. And by the way,
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   if they don't prove it, it will be a stain on the Department of Justice for bringing the case at all.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.720]   I happen to believe... So then why support it? I mean, look, so... Hold on. Let me agree with you.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:16.160]   I'm going to finish that. Okay, okay. I know what you're going to say, so I'll finish it.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:23.280]   I believe, given what I know, that Donald Trump does not believe that the election was stolen.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:31.840]   That's what I believe from knowing him for 22 years and from being with him in much of the
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:38.560]   pre-election period and him expressing his very genuine concerns about the fact that he was losing
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.920]   to Biden and that he could lose to Biden, not because of mail-in ballots, because of COVID,
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.480]   that I don't believe he really believes the election was stolen.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.480]   But can you prove that beyond a reasonable doubt?
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.880]   Well, that's the part that's aggressive, David, and I don't know all the evidence they have.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:01.520]   I suspect they've got a number of people who are going to tell the jury that Trump told them
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:08.240]   that he thought he lost. But we're going to see. But we're going to see. And that's why I call it
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:11.760]   aggressive. By the way, let me just get on the record here that I agree with you that a lot of
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.080]   the underlying behavior was really bad. And I've said so on the pod before. I'm not defending the
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.840]   underlying behavior. What I question is the wisdom of one president, basically Biden,
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:28.480]   his Justice Department going after the former president who is currently the leading candidate
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:34.480]   in the election against him and doing it within a year before the election as opposed to
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.960]   three years ago. How is that wise?
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:42.160]   David, let me ask you a question. First off, if they had indicted Donald Trump
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.760]   six months after January 6th, you know what everybody would have said? Rush to judgment.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:56.080]   No good investigation. They had this predetermined. You can't win as a prosecutor on that one.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.400]   Either you went too quick or you waited too long. So I don't buy that at all. I think it's bull.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:11.280]   Now, on the question of whether or not a president should allow his Justice Department
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:17.600]   to charge someone who is his predecessor and potentially an opponent again,
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:24.320]   well, what's the alternative? Let's take it away from the January 6th one and look at the documents
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:32.960]   one. If he obstructed justice, if he lied and obstructed the grand jury subpoena, if he kept
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.840]   classified documents he was not entitled to keep and then hid them from his own lawyers when they
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.520]   were trying to respond to that, if he instructed people to delete surveillance camera video,
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.800]   which would have shown him having people move those documents, then all you have to do is
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:55.680]   declare for president and you don't get prosecuted. I mean, I understand it's a lousy situation,
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.200]   but there are a number of people who believe that the only reason Donald Trump is running
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:07.040]   for president again is to be able to make that argument. And so I understand it's an awful
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:15.360]   — no, no, I think he wants retribution from the seat of power for everybody who thinks that he's
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.560]   wrong. Okay, hold on, I want to ask you a question. You did four in a row. No, no, no, no, I want to
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.720]   ask why. You did four in a row. I'll do one. So, Governor Christie, let me ask you a question,
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.680]   because you know Trump. Do you think he tried to overturn the election? And do you think,
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.720]   given the chance to overturn the election and steal the election, Donald Trump, based on your
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.800]   knowledge of his character for multiple decades and working with him, do you think he would have
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:43.040]   done it? Do you think he's that criminal-minded? I don't think he would have any — he would have
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:49.600]   had any problem with the election being overturned. Okay. And I think if it was,
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.960]   he would have been more than happy to have his rear end sleeping in the White House tonight.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:05.360]   Now, I think he evolved to that position in this respect. I've had the opportunity to meet
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.480]   a number of different presidents, every president going back to Bush 41. Every one of them,
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:22.720]   regardless of my disagreements with them on policy, were matured and humbled by the office,
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.760]   except for him. Okay, well said.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:34.080]   The office made him worse. It made him a worse person. I've known him for 22 years. The guy I
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:42.720]   met in 2001 would not have done what 2020 Donald Trump did. And I think he is a perfect example
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:51.200]   of power having corrupted someone to the point where he was willing to not only engage in that
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:58.560]   conduct, but to essentially threaten his own vice president to try to get him to do something.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.960]   Do you think Russiagate played a role in that? I mean, meaning, here, Donald Trump,
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.200]   he's the ultimate outsider, maybe has a chip on his shoulder about not being accepted
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:12.560]   by certain elements of society. He wins the White House, it's this huge shock.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.880]   And rather than accepting it, the entire Democratic Party said his election was illegitimate,
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.040]   and they claimed that basically somehow Putin masterminded it. And then they subjected him to
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.680]   two years of this Mueller investigation, which turned up nothing, but they claimed that he was
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   basically an agent. Turned up a lot.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.160]   You still believe in the PTA. A lot of people went to jail.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.360]   You still believe in the spill. A lot of people went to jail.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:34.960]   You still believe in the Steele dossier. Okay, the rest of the world.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.600]   But a lot of people went to jail, and he did ask the Russians for help.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.360]   The Steele dossier was completely made up.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.160]   I didn't talk about the Steele dossier. I'm talking about their relationship with Russia.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.920]   That was the basis for the whole Russiagate hoax.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.320]   I'm talking about him asking for help from Russia.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.080]   You're the last person to live in that simulation, Jason.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:48.960]   That's not correct.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:53.760]   I'm asking the governor a question. Do you think the two years of this Russiagate hoax
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.360]   basically drove Trump to this behavior, or played a role in it?
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.560]   I'll go with your last piece, not the first one.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:09.200]   I have no doubt that it contributed to his feeling that people were after him. No doubt.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.640]   And I said from the beginning, I thought the Russia thing was complete crap.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.920]   And the reason I thought it was, was because I was there in 2016.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:24.560]   That campaign was so bad and so disorganized, they couldn't have arranged a two-car funeral,
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.800]   let alone conspired with the Russian government to interfere with the election.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:37.360]   I was there. It was amateurish. And it won because they ran against the worst
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.040]   presidential candidate in my lifetime, in Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.240]   So I said from the beginning, I thought the Russia investigation was illegitimate
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:49.680]   and was wrong. Do I think it contributed to his attitude? I think it did.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.440]   But I don't think, David, it would be fair to say that that's what made him that way.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.240]   Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. I appreciate that answer.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:03.280]   But I think there's a lot more that contributed to it than that. But yeah, I would certainly
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:10.400]   concede that because I objected to the Russia investigation at the time in real time, publicly.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.760]   Kudos to you for that because I think you've been vindicated by what's happened in the last few
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.400]   years. I do too.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.960]   Last question for me on documents. Okay. Do you think that there's a selective prosecution
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.680]   issue here? Because Sandy Berger stuffed documents in his pants from a clean room,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:31.600]   never prosecuted. Petraeus had a huge classified documents problem, slap on the wrist. I mean,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.560]   it seems like, and by the way, Biden had documents by his beloved Corvette
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:42.240]   and in offices all over the place going back many years. So I mean, isn't this documents case,
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.760]   it seems like no one really wanted to prosecute this law until Trump did it. And now it's like,
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.800]   get Trump.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.560]   Now, look, I think Trump did this one to himself, David. If he had turned over the documents he
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:03.280]   illegally had at any point when he was being requested to from February of 2021 through to
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.880]   when the search occurred, there would be no prosecution.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:07.760]   Well, I agree with that.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.800]   And the proof of that-
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.080]   I agree with that. But why not prosecute these other guys?
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.160]   Because they gave the documents back.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:19.360]   Because look, Biden gave the documents back. I mean, Pence gave the documents back when asked.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:25.440]   What this guy did was obstructed it in every way he could. I don't want people looking through my
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:33.120]   boxes, my boxes. This guy is like a freak about these boxes. I'm telling you. I used to campaign
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:39.120]   with him. He would have a box of documents. Now, back then it was 2016, it was a box of documents
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:45.200]   from Trump Tower. No one could touch them. No one could look at them. He'd go through them a little
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:52.640]   bit, but he literally had a seat for his box of documents next to him on his plane. No one could
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.800]   sit next to him. The box of documents went next to him. So there's a psychosis here on the documents,
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.880]   David, that's deep. All right?
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.240]   Okay. But maybe that indicates this is a-
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.120]   He did this to himself. He did it to himself.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.440]   I agree he walked into it. I agree he totally walked into this.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:14.720]   No, no. He sprinted into it with his arms wide open and he screwed himself. But in the process,
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.080]   he screwed the country.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.800]   But what you're describing is an idiosyncratic issue. He liked his boxes. He had mementos in
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.120]   them. This was not a national security issue. And there's-
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.080]   Oh, sure it was.
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:24.400]   How?
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.360]   Sure it was.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:25.600]   How?
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.840]   You cannot permit the president of the United States to be flashing around in a ran war plan
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:35.920]   on the deck at Mar-a-Lago. Sorry, not allowed.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.560]   Bingo.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.360]   Especially not after your president. And you know what? He could have declassified any
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.440]   documents he wanted to when he was president. He didn't. And now he's trying to say he mind
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:52.160]   melded them to be declassified. Come on, David. This stuff is such bullshit. It's laughable.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.640]   But you agree the president has an unlimited authority to declassify documents, right?
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.520]   Of course.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.000]   So he didn't do it through the process he wanted, but who's to say that he didn't do it?
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.240]   No. His attorney general said he didn't do it. His White House counsel said he didn't do it.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.400]   His view is he didn't. So who's to say he didn't?
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.840]   His view, he declassified other documents the appropriate way. These he just thought
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.640]   about declassifying, therefore they were declassified. Come on. Come on, seriously.
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.320]   I agree it's a bad argument, but I guess-
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.360]   No, it's not a bad argument.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.800]   But David will make it anyway.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.840]   David, it's not a bad argument. It's not an argument.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.440]   Come back anytime you want, Chris.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:27.920]   It's not an argument.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.760]   I think you got to sit in. I think you got to sit in.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:36.800]   I mean, look, I will tell you guys, I am very sympathetic to executive authority.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:43.200]   I've been a governor of the state that has the strongest constitutional governorship in America.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:50.240]   But you got to follow the law. When the law empowers you to the extent that the United
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:56.320]   States president is empowered, that should be enough. You shouldn't have to act outside the law.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.560]   And here's why he did it. He didn't do it to sell the documents.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.360]   He didn't do them to give them to some foreign power. He did them to show off.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:13.840]   Look what I have. Look, I'm still really the president. This is the real core problem with him,
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.240]   David.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:18.080]   But doesn't this pale in comparison to the crimes of the Biden family? I mean,
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.480]   Robert Peters sold the Huffington Post.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:26.560]   I don't know. Do we have time to talk about the two billion dollars that Jared Kushner has gotten
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.960]   from the Saudis and why he got that money? Is it because he's such an expert investor?
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.600]   The guy who bought 666 Fifth Avenue and nearly bankrupted his entire company?
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.680]   I mean, he's actually a pretty smart guy. I mean, oh, yeah. Oh, no. He's a genius.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.800]   He's an absolute genius, David. And that's why the Saudis gave him two billion dollars.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.720]   He was out of office. We're talking about...
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.120]   For three weeks.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:51.840]   We're talking about...
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.600]   You just talked about earlier, Sachs, that we have to stop the grift.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.840]   We're talking about the Biden family. Biden is vice president and his son is running around
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.360]   the world collecting money.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:06.080]   David, why would a president of the United States, when he has somebody like Mike Pompeo
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.800]   as his secretary of state, who's been a congressman, a West Point graduate,
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:19.200]   member of the military, CIA director, secretary of state, why is he sending Jared Kushner over?
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:19.600]   Grift.
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:20.080]   To negotiate with the Saudis.
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.720]   Are you arguing with the results? He got the Abraham Accords done.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.440]   No, no, no, no.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.000]   Wait, wait, two things he wants.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.480]   And by the way, now he gets... Wait, no, no, he gets the... Oh, so now we're not giving
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:35.360]   Pompeo the credit for the Abraham Accords. It's Jared Kushner. Look, in the end, Pompeo
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:35.920]   closed that deal.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.400]   Do you think the Abraham Accords were a good idea or a bad idea?
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.840]   Great idea. Great idea.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:42.480]   Why don't you give Kushner credit? He was definitely involved.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.040]   Well, hold on. No, no, no. He's involved. Congratulations.
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.480]   In fact, he may have been the lead person involved.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.680]   Why was he sent in the first place? Because of his extensive foreign policy experience?
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.800]   Maybe he has fresh ideas.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:59.920]   Managing apartment buildings in New Jersey? That's what he was doing. So look,
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:06.080]   I absolutely believe that, as I answered your question very directly before,
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.440]   that the only reason Hunter Biden was hired for these things was to get influence with his father.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:18.240]   Absolutely. And I think he should go to jail. But we can't look at Jared and Ivanka making
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.440]   40-plus million dollars a year while they were in the White House, getting $2 billion from the
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:30.240]   Saudis to invest after they leave the White House, and say that's not a grift as well, not to mention
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.680]   the fact that he's spending campaign money to pay his legal fees when he's supposed to be
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.200]   a billionaire. How about you sell the Trump Tower apartment since you don't live there anymore
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.240]   and pay your legal fees with that? Or how about sell one of your frigging golf courses
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:53.440]   to pay your legal fees with that? But instead, a $100 average donation from Americans who donated
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:59.840]   to something called Save America, which was supposed to fight the steal of the election,
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.360]   is now being spent to pay his legal fees because he took classified documents illegally out of
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:11.360]   the White House. And by the way, that same organization paid Kimberly Guilfoyle 60 grand
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:18.480]   to give a three-minute speech on January 6th and paid $208,000 to Melania's stylist
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.280]   as political strategy.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:21.840]   She looks great.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.320]   There's plenty of grift to go around. And I'll tell you this.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.600]   The grift is deep.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.240]   The Christie administration, no member of my family will make money off the fact that I'm
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.680]   president. You can't say that about Trump or Biden.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.200]   Okay, this has been an amazing two hours.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:37.760]   Killing me.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.960]   With Governor Chris Christie. Well done. So honest.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.760]   Well done.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.000]   Great debate.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.480]   Thank God I had these lozenges, or I'd have no voice.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:49.920]   Final question. When you did this karaoke with David Freeburg,
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:57.600]   did you do Thunder Road, Living on a Prayer, Rosalita? What was the song? Or did you guys do
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.000]   Don't Go Breaking My Heart, a duet?
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.040]   I don't remember which song David and I did together, but I did do Thunder Road
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:10.160]   karaoke in that small bar in that little town in Idaho.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.360]   The Beep event.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:18.720]   I think I do also remember there being a karaoke on a Backstreet Boys song.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.000]   Oh, that's definitely Freeburg. Yeah, that's definitely Freeburg.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.280]   And I don't think Freeburg was in that one. I don't think.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.960]   Do you remember, David, which song we did?
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.400]   Endless Love?
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:28.880]   I don't remember.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.960]   I know. It definitely wasn't that.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.600]   There was a group thing.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.840]   Don't Go Breaking My Heart, T.D. Elton John?
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.680]   There's got to be one in there. Listen, Governor, we really appreciate you coming on.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.640]   We wish you great success. Congratulations on New Hampshire.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.400]   And really, really, thank you. Did a great job today.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.840]   Thank you for being so forthright.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.800]   Thank you guys for giving me the… Look, I love the opportunity to be able to go
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:58.480]   into more depth about this in anything other than UFOs. So that's really good.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.200]   Oh, wait, we have another hour of UFO questions.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:07.920]   I would really encourage you to spread this gospel of the most thoughtful way to beat back
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.240]   corruption is something like zero-based budgeting across the entire federal government.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.760]   Yeah, I like that too. That was a great…
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:22.000]   Nobody says it. People are… I think RFK and Vivek scratch it, but I think you could nail
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.080]   it if you take it and want to run with it. And there's just a lot of money that's probably
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.720]   sloshing on the sidelines that needs to get reallocated.
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:31.520]   And you… Not probably.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.800]   I'm sure you saw how viral John Seward's interview with the Undersecretary of Defense for Budget went.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:41.040]   That was an incredible interview. And obviously, it hits a nerve with a lot of people. So,
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.840]   it's a really important point. It speaks a lot to the broader issue.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:50.320]   Well, I'm glad to be here. I'm happy that I did not take my son's briefing,
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:55.520]   but I can guarantee you that he's going to be listening. He's very stressed. He's actually…
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:58.960]   He works for the New York Mets. He's down in Dominican Republic today.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.520]   Oof. What a shit show.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.800]   And he called me from the DR and he said, "Is today the all-in day?"
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.760]   And I said, "Yes, today's the day." He goes, "Call me right afterwards." So, he's fine.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.280]   What are you going to tell him? What are you going to tell him?
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.240]   I'm going to tell him it was great. We had a great two hours, and he's going to enjoy
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.080]   listening to it. And anytime you guys want me back, I'm back.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.000]   Yeah, now also fix the Mets. Fix the Mets.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:18.480]   Thank you. Thank you very much.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.800]   Yeah, I'm on the board there too. I think that's a bigger problem.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:21.920]   Yeah, a little bit of work to do.
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.160]   That may be worse than zero-based budgeting. I don't know.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.320]   Yeah. At least the Knicks look like they built a nice foundation here. I like where my Knicks are.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.480]   Don't give up on the Mets yet. Wait till next year.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.400]   Oh, I'm not giving up. We'll get there.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.200]   All right. Two hours with the governor, going around the horn here. Friedberg,
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.000]   your thoughts after two hours with Governor Christie. Where was he strong? Where do you
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.160]   disagree with him? What do you think of his presidency after two hours of intimate discussion
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:52.160]   here on All In Podcast? I don't know if I've got a huge shift in
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.400]   opinion. He's a very personable guy. He has a good command of the subject. He's got good experience
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.120]   running a state. So those are good qualifying criteria. Obviously, this is a very challenging
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.920]   race for him. I'm not sure if he hits any zingers that really helps accelerate him past
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:15.120]   the momentum that Vivek has and obviously the lead that Trump has with the conservative party
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:19.600]   support with DeSantis. So it seems like it's going to be a tough campaign and a tough race for him.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.240]   I'm not sure he brings anything today that shows how he's going to kind of get ahead of this
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:30.240]   problem. So that's the campaign. Let's talk about for you, if you were to contrast him to other
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:37.360]   Republican candidates, DeSantis, Hallie, Vivek, where does he fall for you personally?
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.040]   Yeah, I remain of the concern that there's a giant meteor, hitting a fiscal meteor hitting
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.720]   the United States. Okay. And everyone's talking about a lot of other stuff.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.120]   Okay. And it's the don't look up documentary to me.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.960]   Okay. And he's the most attuned to that in your mind or Nikki?
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:58.880]   He's a good point of view. I think his alignment around keeping military spending and you know,
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:05.760]   this, this discussion around corruption, it's, it's such a, a micro problem relative to the macro
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:13.120]   condition. Again, 31% of US debt coming up for refinancing this year. It's going to be,
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.800]   you know, and we're already seeing, by the way, this year interest expense on the debt
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:22.160]   is greater than the military spending. If you had to pick two candidates on the Republican Party
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.840]   that were most intriguing to you for your vote, which two would they be?
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:30.720]   I'm going to skip that question for now. Okay. Chamath, I'll go to you post this two hour
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:36.080]   discussion. He I thought he was great. I'm curious how you thought were the strong points in this
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:42.080]   discussion. And then I guess we can talk about his campaign as free bird just did. But then we
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:47.360]   could also talk about how he resonates with you. And in terms of getting your vote, maybe where he
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:53.040]   sits, I don't think my opinion has changed much before or after. I mean, I think that he's a,
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:59.280]   he's a very personable, charming guy. But I'm not sure that he says anything that's different
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:05.920]   from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. And I think that the winning candidate,
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:11.600]   whether I agree with it or not, is irrelevant at this point. But the formula has been laid
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:17.040]   bare for everybody to see. And I think that you have to have radical ideas. And so when you think
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:21.520]   about the people that are getting the most attention on both the Democratic and the
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:28.080]   Republican side, what they're essentially pushing back on is all of this orthodoxy.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:37.680]   And if he really wants to win, he has to embrace being unorthodox and heterodox. And he doesn't
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:44.640]   have enough heterodoxical policies to cut through. So he just cannot win as a practical matter. So
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.960]   if he embraces those heterodoxies, because he believes in them,
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:54.400]   he's he has a chance, but if he doesn't, it's going to be Trump versus Vivek.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:52:03.520]   So if it winds up being Biden, Vivek, Trump, Christie, Nikki in this sort of like final,
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.400]   you know, race towards finish line, which two candidates you find most appealing right now?
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:12.960]   Not not saying you'll vote for them, but which two are resonating with Chamath
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.000]   Polyhapitiya most?
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.800]   I'm still pretty open minded. I haven't decided. I know who doesn't resonate with me.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.520]   Okay, tell me.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:20.720]   Is DeSantis.
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:23.200]   Okay, so DeSantis is off the table. Everybody else is still
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:28.080]   and I was very clear early on that his campaign was do away. And I think that that's probably
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:34.640]   just going to he's going to have a withering kind of embarrassing and to the campaign,
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:40.320]   unfortunately for him, but I think the the the heterodoxical rhetoric is going to get ramped up
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:47.200]   both by RFK and by Vivek. And I think it's going to put a lot of pressure and by Trump. And I think
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.040]   it's going to put a lot of pressure on Biden. And it's going to put a lot of pressure on the other
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.520]   Republican nominees to cut through the noise here.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:58.320]   It's an interesting point to Chamath because if the chorus becomes this heterodox
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:05.360]   point of view, it's it looks really bad. Biden is almost in this truly defensive mode,
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.520]   because then you have multiple parties speaking similarly about the establishment.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:12.240]   I think there's a very good chance that Biden's son,
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.600]   he's indicted this week,
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:19.440]   is in jail by the time the election comes around, which I think also speaks very poorly
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:28.320]   to the risk that there is some clear links of corruption that come out. And I think that
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:35.920]   that's going to put the election under severe pressure. And I think you can you can bet that
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:42.640]   every single Republican mega donor is going to come out of the woodwork to fund a super PAC
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:48.640]   that's going to blast the airwaves all across the country with that content. So that's I think a
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:54.480]   foregone conclusion, if it looks like there is fire where there looks right now is smoke. And
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:54:02.080]   if David Weiss acts this decisively, and it moves to trial quickly, which I suspect it will, this is
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:07.520]   all bad news for Biden. And so, you know, you have that on that side, the Republicans have the red
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.840]   meat that they need. The heterodoxy on both sides is what's getting all the attention.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:17.440]   So, you know, I think I think what Donald Trump did in hindsight was really break the glass on
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:25.120]   being able to say the things you couldn't say. And that will now be the formula for candidates to win.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:31.520]   Yeah, just for folks who haven't been watching the news, Justice Department is believed to
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.200]   indict Hunter on the gun charges this month, I think they're still investing gating the potential
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.480]   corruption where there's smoke, maybe there's fire. And if it leads to Biden, and so this whole
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:46.400]   race could be totally flipped upside down at any moment. Same with Trump and his indictment.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.880]   The gun charges are nothing charge, just so everyone understands what that is when he applied
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:56.400]   to get a firearm. You know, you have to take you have to check off these checkboxes on the form.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.320]   And one of them is I apparently that you don't have a drug problem.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:08.480]   And so he lied on that form, I guess. But that that's the kind of charge that I personally
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:11.520]   don't believe they should be going after him for because I don't think they would prosecute an
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.520]   ordinary person for that.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.960]   Yeah. And in his defense, Hunter said, I have no problem scoring drugs. So I don't have a
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.880]   drug problem. I can get them anytime I need them.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:24.080]   It's one of these weird kind of almost again, like a paperwork charge. And remember that what
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:31.360]   the DOJ tried to do was a settlement with Hunter Biden, where he had plead guilty on that same gun
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.240]   charge, because it's kind of a nothing charge, but then buried deep in that settlement was a
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:42.160]   broad immunity on all the foreign lobbying he was doing the FARA Act violations. And then it came
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:46.560]   out and the judge said, wait a second, like, that's too much. Like, what are you doing? And
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:53.200]   they reject the judge rejected the settlement. So frankly, I view the charges by the DOJ on the gun
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.760]   charge as a misdirection of what the real issue is with Hunter Biden. He was running around the
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.720]   world collecting money with being an unregistered foreign agent, foreign lobbyist. Yeah, that's the
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.120]   crux of the issue is that's the corruption.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.520]   alleged but the point is, that's what the DOJ should be looking at. Not these like,
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.320]   that's what they were looking at. Yeah, that hunter use drugs.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.400]   That's the David I think I think looking at the tax evasion tax fraud charges, that is their way
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:24.320]   of looking at that. So I think it's going to come out. I think at this point, they're looking at
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:30.720]   both. Everybody will have the truth. If the Biden's are truly not guilty, that will be clearly
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:36.320]   established now in this process. But if he was acting as an unregistered agent of these foreign
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.360]   governments, that is also going to come out. And if there were links between him and his father,
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.360]   and communications, that's also going to come out. I think that he hasn't even been indicted on that
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.280]   yet. Right? Yeah, I think it takes time. I think they will thoughtfully put it together. But
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.520]   I'm not confident about it, given that they wanted to give him broad immunity on those charges.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:00.080]   I think no, but I think I think David Weiss is under such a microscope right now. The idea that
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.720]   he doesn't act conclusively here, I think would be a huge problem. And then the next president,
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.280]   if it's Republican, will reopen it. So whatever happens here will need to be definitive. And I
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:12.320]   think the special prosecutor probably understands that at this point.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:17.520]   So let's go back to your impressions before we go down the Biden, Biden, Biden rabbit hole here.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.360]   What are your thoughts after two hours with Chris Christie, anything change in your outlook on him?
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.520]   And then I'm curious, are you still team to Santa's all the way?
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:33.440]   Okay, so on Christie, I like talking to him more than I thought I was going to.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.520]   I think he was easy to talk to, I think the two hours went by pretty quickly.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:43.840]   I think he brought his energy level down to the right place for a podcast. I mean,
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:48.560]   it was a little different than when he's very pugnacious on the debate stage and can kind of
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:53.360]   grandstand and he, you know, engaged in a discussion with us. So I thought that was
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:58.480]   positive. The only time his energy really changed was basically in the last five minutes, when he
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:05.040]   went on to a full on like Trump diatribe. And it was almost like, you know, a little bit of TDS
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:10.240]   kicked in. That being said, his position on Trump was a little bit more nuanced than I was expecting.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.160]   First of all, he admitted the whole Russiagate thing was total baloney. Second, he said that
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.520]   with respect to the state charges, the Alvin Bragg in New York and the Fannie Willis in Atlanta,
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:24.800]   those charges should not have been brought. Yeah, that was pretty good. I kind of agree
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:28.960]   with him on those. I agree with his. I thought that was intellectually honest. Did you feel
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.600]   intellectual honesty from him? Yeah, I think he really believes this. Yeah. Third, I took a couple
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:39.760]   of tries by Chamath and then me to get him to say this, but he said he would not put Trump in jail.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.680]   He's too old for that. And I thought that was, I wasn't sure where he was going to come out on
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:47.440]   that. I didn't know if he was going to say Trump deserves a life sentence. Yeah, we should have
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:51.120]   asked him if he would pardon him if he was president. He said, he said, I didn't pardon
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:56.000]   him. But I commute his sentence. So he didn't have to spend time in jail. So I thought that was
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:02.400]   new information. And again, a more nuanced view than I was expecting on the documents case. He
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:06.320]   said that Trump ran into the charges, which frankly, I agree with I think, yeah, I've kind
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:11.760]   of avoided that easily. However, Christie said he did it for idiosyncratic reasons. He loves his
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:17.360]   box of mementos. Yes, didn't really address my very you and I have Yeah, yeah. And you know,
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:21.840]   who else loves their mementos? I have I have a handful of kids under the age of five who love
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:28.720]   blankets. And yes, the blankie pacifiers, Teddy. Yeah, I would just go a little further and just
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:32.720]   say, Listen, if he did this for idiosyncratic reasons, rather than nefarious reasons,
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:37.280]   like selling state secrets, then I think you apply the same standard of prosecution
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:43.760]   as they did to portray us or to Biden himself. The thing you keep missing is that those people
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:48.400]   gave those back. You keep missing. I don't know why you have that blind spot. Because he basically
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:54.160]   said that Trump has an anxiety complex and he sued he self soothes with that box of documents.
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:59.280]   That's what he said. Gaga, Google Gaga. But that's what he that's what he said.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:03.120]   I would treat Trump the same way as Sandy Berger. I mean, come on, those guys.
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:07.680]   This is moving justice. Are you still moving on?
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:16.160]   The last point was on the Jack Smith charges where he admitted that Jack Smith has to prove
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:23.840]   beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump knew that his election denial argument was false. And I think he
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:28.960]   pretty much admitted that that would be a very, very hard thing to prove. But he said he wanted
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:33.440]   to wait to see what evidence they had. To me, that kind of begs the question of why you bring that
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:38.240]   case in the first place. Any event, so that's on Trump. I think what I saw there was a little bit
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:43.440]   of TDS, but a more nuanced overall perspective when you got into the details on foreign policy.
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:50.320]   I think we had a lot of interesting conversation there about the mismanagement of the military
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:55.200]   industrial complex. And I think Jamal had some really interesting questions there that that I
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:01.680]   followed up on. And really, you couldn't get him to say anything other than he wouldn't necessarily
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:06.640]   increase the size of the defense budget until you did the efficiency survey. But he kind of had to
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:12.800]   be pushed to even get there. And what I would just say is that on that question on military spending,
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:18.400]   combined with the question of Ukraine, he pretty much has the standard establishment Republican
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:24.640]   position, which is the only thing Biden has done wrong is not move aggressively enough on Ukraine.
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:30.560]   That giving mixed messages, not being hawkish enough. I'm sorry, but Biden has had the most
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:35.600]   hawkish policy on Ukraine that any president's ever had. And the only reason there's been
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:40.720]   hand wringing about giving them f 16s is because it could start World War Three. And I personally
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:46.480]   want Biden thinking about that, you know, so again, I think this neocon Republican position
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.640]   that involves Chris Christie and Haley and Pence and Mitch McConnell, you know, basically the whole
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:58.080]   Republican establishment, they basically believe that Biden who says we need to support Ukraine
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.400]   for as long as it takes as much as it takes, he's still not doing enough. I just don't fundamentally
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.440]   buy that argument. You still teams the sentence. Here's my view on it. So look, I would support
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.240]   the sentence. I also would support Vivek for me. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is new information.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:18.480]   So you're saying you are now equally open minded to the vague and the Santa is not equally minded.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:23.520]   But look, for me, what percent most? Here's the way I divide it, I divide candidates at this point
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:30.160]   into acceptable versus unacceptable. Okay. And for me, the number one issue is whether the president,
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:36.800]   the next president will seek to deescalate or end the Ukraine war, or they will seek to escalate it.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.160]   God's Christy, along with all these others, by saying that Biden has been too dovish on Ukraine,
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.520]   is effectively saying he wants to do even more on Ukraine. So we're not willing to take,
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:53.760]   I'm not willing to live for the next four years on the knife's edge of war three, I don't want
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:57.920]   to put you in residence camp to put what I want the sort of war three.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.520]   So that puts you in Vivek's camp?
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:06.400]   Well, no, I think that the candidates who said that they would either end or deescalate Ukraine,
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.560]   or Vivek, DeSantis and Trump has said it. They're the only three Oh, and sorry,
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:12.080]   Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.760]   Okay, but you're not gonna vote for him. So that puts you in Vivek.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:18.800]   Well, I don't know. I mean, he might be my favorite, to be honest.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:19.920]   Would you pick him over Trump?
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.680]   I would certainly take Kennedy over Trump.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.720]   You would Wow, this is incredible. Breaking news, folks. This is, this is all incredible.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.280]   Wow. Look, for me, this is the limits test issue is are you going to escalate or deescalate the
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:37.680]   Ukraine war? And I think that these hawkish Republican candidates pose an unacceptable
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.440]   risk or three. What do you think, Jason? Yeah, Jason, what do you think? I thought he broke
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:42.880]   your heart there in a couple of places.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:48.160]   No, actually, I don't expect all candidates to line up with my belief system perfectly.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:54.560]   Obviously, he's well spoken. Obviously, he's qualified. I'm looking for a moderate like
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.520]   Freeberg. I think the existential crisis of the balance sheet is my top issue. I voted
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:06.400]   Republican about 25%. And Democrats 75%. I'm literally a moderate and an independent and
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.760]   right now, I really don't think Biden can be president or Trump. So that leaves me with
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:18.560]   RFK on one side. And it leaves me with Nikki Haley and Christie on the other side. And Nikki
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:22.880]   Haley and Christie are really into balancing the budget. And so I'm leaning towards voting
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:28.240]   Republican, if those are the two candidates. Now, the thing that I think handicapping this
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:34.560]   election is not being talked about all that much, because we have the Trump Biden rematch
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.000]   taking while they are in the room is I don't know that Biden makes it to the starting line,
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.400]   nor do I think Trump makes it to the starting line. And so that changes everything. And who
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.280]   knows what percentage chance that is, I don't think any of us can give it a perfect
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:51.440]   handicap. But let's say that is the case. Then I think it's, you know, there's a lot of lanes
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.920]   open here. And I think the election will be once again, determined by moderates. And I think women
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:01.520]   who are still very much upset about the Roe v. Wade issue. And I think those two things are
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:04.720]   going to play a significant role. And that's where I think Nikki Haley and Chris Christie
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:10.640]   believe it's a state's issue, and they're not into the national ban for abortion. I think
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:15.280]   moderates are not into Biden. I think they will or I don't think they're going to be into RFK.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.400]   I think they're going to be into Nikki Haley. And I think Nikki Haley could happen. And I
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:22.160]   think Chris Christie, so I hope we get Nikki Haley on here, because I don't know her enough,
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:26.880]   but I would like to have that to our discussion. So I'm leaning towards Haley, Christie if they
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:32.080]   make it. All right, this has been an amazing episode of the All In podcast. We went for over
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:38.000]   two hours. Enjoy the one and a half times episode, everybody, because next week is the All In Summit.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.960]   And we're not going to tape next week. So you get a week off from the pod, while we bank,
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:50.400]   I think like 20 amazing, amazing guests from Ray Dalio to Elon Musk to Mr. Beast.
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:58.000]   I mean, the list of people Gwyneth Paltrow that Freeburg has put together is extraordinary.
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.120]   Congratulations to Freeburg on a program even better than last year's program is an unprecedented
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:09.920]   success here. So great, great job, Freeburg, and the team over at the production board.
