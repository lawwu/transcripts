[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Will marriage cure my lust? That's today's question from an unmarried listener named
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.760]   Mark. "Dear Pastor John, I'm a 22 year old burdened with strong sexual desires.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.360]   Sometimes I submit to the flesh and look at pornography. I hate this and I'm fighting
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.280]   against this sin with the help of my friends. In the meantime, I have some friends who seek to care
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.400]   for my soul by quoting the Apostle Paul, 'For it is better to marry than to burn with passion'
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.240]   1 Corinthians 7, 9. And they say I should marry soon. But I also have married friends who assure
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.920]   me that marriage will not cure my lust and tell me it would be a battle I would carry into marriage.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.480]   So I'm confused. If marriage cures lust, I should marry soon. If it doesn't cure lust,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.840]   then I need to work on personal purity now without the urgency to marry. So which is it?"
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:05.440]   Mark, my sense is in listening to your question that you have a distorted, maybe all or nothing
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.680]   mindset. When you say, "If marriage cures lust, I should marry soon. If it doesn't cure lust,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.640]   then I need to work on personal purity now without the urgency to marry." Now, when you say that,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:33.120]   it sounds to me like you have in your mind either marriage cures lust or it doesn't. Total cure or
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.840]   total non-cure. You know, that's what I mean by the all or nothing mindset. But that's not the
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.280]   picture we see in the Bible. So let's get the text in front of us so that we can see what the real
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.080]   help is that the Scripture gives precisely at this point. Because you're right to focus
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.360]   right on this issue. First Corinthians 7, 8, 9 says, "To the unmarried and the widows, I say that
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.920]   it is good for them to remain single as I am, but if they cannot exercise self-control, they should
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.880]   marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." So, Mark, you're right to see marriage
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.760]   as a God-designed help in dealing with the overpowering passions and sexual desires. That's
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.280]   what it says. But there's nothing here that I see about a total cure, but rather a definite offer
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.960]   of help. Same thing in 1 Corinthians 7 earlier, verses 2 to 5, it says, "But because of the
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.720]   temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.360]   The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights"—it's a fancy way of saying, "have sex
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.000]   with her when it's helpful for her, and likewise the wife to her husband." So sex with him when
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.680]   it's helpful for him. "For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.880]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does." Each has a claim
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.200]   on the other for sexual relations. "Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.560]   limited time." Here comes this interesting part. "That you may devote yourself to prayer, but then
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.760]   come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control." So
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   clearly, Paul is teaching that God has designed sexual relations in marriage as a way to weaken
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.800]   sinful impulses towards adultery. Otherwise, he wouldn't have said, "Get back together quick!
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:59.120]   Satan's gonna tempt you!" Now, if we think—and some people do, and I have certainly struggled
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.200]   with this over the years—if we think this sounds like a merely pragmatic, kind of low vision of
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.920]   marriage—get married, have sex, you don't have to commit adultery or fornication—well, it's not.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:23.040]   It's not. It's a pragmatic effect of marriage, which is a far greater reality than its merely
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.840]   sexual pragmatic effects. To see the vision of marriage, the big, glorious, God-centered
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.360]   vision of marriage, we would go to Ephesians 5, for example. But just like it would be wrong
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.840]   to think that sexual pragmatics is the totality of the meaning of marriage, it would also be wrong
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   to think that the magnificent theological vision of marriage in Ephesians 5, with Christ and the
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.560]   Church modeling the roles of husband and wife, did not include these nitty-gritty practical sexual
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.400]   effects of marriage. So it's both/and, not either/or, both magnificent God-centered vision
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:20.480]   of marriage and nitty-gritty practical physical effects of marriage. Now I think, as I was
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   thinking about this, it seemed to me that it might be helpful for Mark to consider that sexual
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:36.800]   relations in marriage are a physical help in the spiritual battle against lust and adultery the
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:46.000]   same way that other physical acts help other spiritual battles. Let me illustrate. For example,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.800]   the physical act of getting enough sleep helps in our spiritual battle against the sin of impatience.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.040]   Getting good physical exercise helps in our spiritual battle against melancholy.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.680]   Taking a walk in the fresh air—Spurgeon said this beautifully—taking a walk in the fresh air
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:15.360]   helps in our battle against discouragement. Considering the lilies and the birds and the
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.680]   heavens helps in our battle against anxiety—Jesus said so, Matthew 6. Physically getting up,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.800]   getting up, using your legs to get up, and leaving his coat behind and running out of the house
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.040]   helped Joseph defeat the sin of adultery with Potiphar's wife. That's why Paul says, "Flee
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.720]   fornication." That is, use your muscles and run, right? This is a physical fight as well as a
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:52.880]   spiritual fight. It's why he says in Romans 13, 14, "Make no provision for the flesh." There are
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:02.400]   practical physical steps we can take that help us in our spiritual battle against sin. In other
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:10.480]   words, God has appointed some physical patterns of behavior as a means of helping us fight
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:18.720]   spiritual battles like the battle against sin. And just like sleep and diet and taking walks
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.280]   and considering the sunrise and running out of a frat party at a certain point and taking certain
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.360]   apps off your phone are physical helps in spiritual battles, even though none of them is an absolute
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:42.000]   cure, in the same way, sexual relations in marriage is a great help in the spiritual battle against
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.600]   lust and adultery, but not an absolute cure. And the reason we know this from Scripture
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   is that Jesus gives such strong warnings against committing adultery, like Luke 18, 20, "Don't
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.600]   commit adultery." There would be no desire for adultery, for goodness sakes, right? There would
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.000]   be no desire for adultery in marriage if sex in marriage were a cure-all for illicit sexual
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.840]   desire. Jesus wouldn't have ever had to say, "Don't commit adultery." So yes, yes, the gift
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.160]   of sexual pleasure in marriage is a great help in fighting the spiritual battle against lust,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:32.880]   against adultery, but it's not a cure-all. Rather, all the fruits of the Spirit, one of which is
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.680]   self-control, Galatians 5:23, all the fruits of the Spirit are still needed in marriage,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   as well as outside marriage. So let me say one other thing that I think is so important,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:56.560]   unless I create an artificial view of marriage. Marriage in the sexual relations, at their best,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:05.520]   create a firewall between the couple and adultery and pornography in other ways besides
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.040]   merely physical. We shouldn't think of the protection from sin merely in terms of sexual
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.720]   relations as a physical release, kind of like a pressure valve that got to keep this guy from
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.320]   exploding in all the wrong places, so he's got to have this pressure valve released every now
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.280]   and then. That's a truth, but it's not the totality of what's going on when Paul says
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.840]   that sexual relations are a firewall. There's more to it than that, and I think in our culture,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.760]   which has so prostituted sex into a hookup weekend sport, it's very hard for them to grasp what I'm
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:53.680]   about to say. God intends that in the intimacies of physical union in marriage, something amazing,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:05.440]   glorious, beautiful, spiritual take place. Depths of affection, covenant intensification,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:16.320]   spiritual union, unfathomable personal bonding take place, which as they grow,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.360]   these depths of union make pornography and adultery more and more unthinkable. That's the
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:36.640]   real glory of sexual relations in marriage. So, Mark, as you go on fighting for sexual purity
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:45.360]   in your single life by the power of the Spirit, that's what you should dream of and pray toward
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   in marriage. That's really great counsel on marriage and in principle, words that are
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.600]   applicable to a lot of life, talking about the physical helps and spiritual battles,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.520]   even though none of those helps are absolute cures. That's really, really good on so many
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.560]   other fronts where our physical life and our spiritual life meet. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.640]   And Mark, thank you for the question. For everything you need to know about this podcast,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:21.040]   go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. Well, it's better for us that Jesus is gone away from us.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.160]   He said so. But how so? Why is his absence better for us than his physical presence?
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.760]   That's the question for us next time on Wednesday. I'm your host Tony Rehnke, and we'll see you then.
