[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   A couple of listeners have emailed in about a recent episode, episode 267, where you said,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.240]   "God is not male."
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.980]   Can you please expand on this, Pastor John?
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.280]   Why is it important to stress that God is not male?
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.880]   Well, let me say what I mean first by God is not male.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.760]   I mean that from eternity, God has not had a body, a physical body, and therefore, he
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.520]   doesn't have male features, facial hair, musculature, male genitals, no Y chromosome,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.120]   no male hormones, things like that.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.540]   Male is a biological word, and God is not a biological being.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.320]   So men and women should not think of God as a man.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.580]   Now Jesus, yes, he is a God-man, not a God-woman.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.120]   The incarnation never ceases.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.320]   Jesus never loses his identity as the God-man, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.960]   He was male on the earth.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.700]   He is now man in heaven, and yes, not woman.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.680]   But we should not think of God the Father or the Holy Spirit as men.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.880]   They are spirit, not biological.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.400]   Now why does this matter?
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.740]   Well, the first reason it matters is because it's true.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.080]   The second reason it matters is because thinking of God as male and thus biological would be
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.580]   diminishing to God.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.880]   God is infinitely above these creaturely distinctions.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:51.120]   And the third reason it matters is because it guards us against drawing wrong conclusions
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.340]   from these facts.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.300]   God is revealed as Father, not Mother.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.760]   God is revealed as King, not Queen.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.040]   And I'm saying mainly here.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.200]   I don't mean that there aren't motherly metaphors for him.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.580]   I'm just saying mainly Father, not Mother.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.780]   Mainly King, not Queen.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.400]   Mainly Lord, not Lady.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.240]   In the marriage with the church, Christ is the husband, and the church is the bride.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.700]   He's not the bride, and she's the husband.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.180]   He installed priests in the Old Testament.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.400]   All of them were men.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   Jesus comes into the world as a man and not as a woman.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.080]   He invests his unique apostolic authority in 12 men, not 12 women.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.740]   Now there are all kinds of false conclusions you could draw from those facts.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.840]   And saying that God is not male is important because it prevents us from drawing some erroneous
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.700]   conclusions from God's fatherliness, or his kingliness, or his lordliness.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.740]   God has other traits, especially of motherliness, in that list.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.900]   And everything—now here it gets really important for the women, so I hope they're listening
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.620]   carefully.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.520]   Everything created in woman that sets her off from man comes from God and reflects something
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.340]   of his image.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.660]   Woman was not modeled on some other God.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.860]   There is no other God.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.820]   She was modeled on God.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:37.260]   When the Bible says she and he were created in the image of God, it means she is who she
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.300]   is on the model of her creator.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.060]   So it's important to say that God, in his essential divine being—not referring to
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.000]   his incarnate union with humanity, but in his essential divine essence—God is not
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.980]   male and God is not female.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.820]   Maleness and femaleness are God's creation as biological bearers of masculinity and femininity,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.580]   both of which are rooted in God.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.580]   Yes, excellent.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.500]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.580]   Tomorrow we will address the question of when is the right time to get married.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.260]   Specifically, one podcast listener asks if he and his fiancée should postpone marriage
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.940]   until they have more money in the bank.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.940]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.940]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.580]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.240]   Amen.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   Amen.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.740]   Amen.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.800]   you
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.860]   you
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
