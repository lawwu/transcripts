[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.080]   All right, we have a question here from Kendo.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.120]   Kendo asks, how soon after the birth of a child
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.480]   is it realistic to start seeking out routines and employing
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.840]   time block strategies?
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.320]   I would say your child should probably
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.040]   be time blocking by, let's say, six weeks.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.760]   I don't know if that's appropriate.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.440]   You can get them a bigger font planner
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.200]   because I know their eyesight's not as good.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.240]   But if they're not time blocking from six weeks,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120]   I don't see how if you spool out that thread,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.640]   they end up getting into Harvard.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.320]   So let's be realistic here, Kendo.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.000]   You've got to get on that.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800]   No, I know you're talking about yourself.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.480]   So it's chaos after a child is born.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560]   The chaos has a different valence
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.880]   depending on which child it is.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.320]   And it's exactly backwards from what you would expect.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.800]   I mean, you'd expect it-- well, the first child--
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   because objectively speaking, the first child
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.640]   should have the least impact because there's just
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.200]   one child in your life, and it's this big,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.240]   and it sleeps most of the day.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.800]   I guess you just get used to things.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600]   And then your second child is actually--
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.200]   the footprint's a little bit smaller.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.600]   And by your third child, it's like, text me from the hospital
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.520]   when the baby's here.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.160]   I'm in a meeting.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.960]   So you get more used to it.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.520]   I don't know.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.880]   You just get used to the chaos.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   Go easy on yourself.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.160]   You should not be immediately back
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.800]   into highly structured time control and time block
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.280]   planning.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   I do think it's pretty important within a week or two
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.320]   to start injecting back some sort of keystone habits
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.040]   or routines that are not focused on some sort of demonstrably
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.720]   large accomplishment, but are focused on self-signaling--
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.280]   that I still have some autonomy over my time,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.040]   and I can still do things that I think are important,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.280]   even though there's this chaos going on in my life right now.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   Again, this is particularly important for your first kid
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.640]   because, again, by the time you have your second or third kid,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.800]   if you're going to have multiple kids,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.880]   there's already family routines going on.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.160]   The disruption will seem a little bit less.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   I remember this really clearly with my first.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.880]   And I don't know exactly what this timing is,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.760]   but it was chaos.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.200]   We didn't know what we were doing.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.920]   And there was a point--
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   must have been a few weeks in, maybe even more.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   I'd have to go back.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.080]   And I kept a diary at this time.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.560]   I'd have to go back and read it.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.800]   But I remember there was a point where the baby was sleeping,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   my wife was sleeping.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.440]   And I went to another room and was just reading a book.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.920]   And I have this memory.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.480]   The book was I was reading, as one does, Descartes.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.280]   So the famous--
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.480]   I forgot what it's called, but the famous Cartesian
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.400]   philosophy, where he sort of establishes existence
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.560]   from just the fact that I think, therefore, I am.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.800]   And I remember thinking, oh, I can still
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   do things that are intellectually interesting
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.680]   and unrelated to this child.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.840]   I can't do a lot of things.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.880]   I was very tired, and I only read for 20 minutes.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.640]   But for whatever reason, that was really profound for me,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   is when I realized, OK, there's some things I can--
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.040]   you can still have some things you were doing
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   that are unrelated to the child.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.840]   And I think it's really important.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   And again, it can be a very small footprint.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000]   Don't try to sell it to your wife
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.560]   that it's important that your habit of,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.240]   I need to golf four days a week, that's
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.520]   not going to fly, I think your habit of,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.960]   it's really important that my routine of going on a guy's
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.160]   trip twice a month to Vegas--
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.780]   it's like an important keystone habit,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.520]   so I'll be back in four days-- that's not going to fly.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.880]   But if it's, I read a little bit before bed,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.360]   I still do a walk every morning.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.240]   There's a little exercise that still happens.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.960]   Maybe you're not going to the gym for an hour and a half,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   but there's a pull-up bar in your garage,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.040]   and you're doing that.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.640]   So having some sort of routine almost immediately,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.280]   by which I mean just habits that are easy and flexible,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   but have nothing to do with the kid that you execute,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.800]   I think that's really important.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.740]   (upbeat music)
