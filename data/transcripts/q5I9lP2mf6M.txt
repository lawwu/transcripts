[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940]   Bing just upgraded YouTube and changed the internet forever,
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.220]   and I'm gonna show you exactly how.
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.900]   I know that statement sounds crazy,
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.820]   especially about something called Bing,
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.240]   but let me prove it to you.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.260]   You can now open up any YouTube video
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.180]   and click on the Bing icon
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.640]   in the top right of the Edge browser.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.020]   Now, it does currently have to be in dev mode,
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.320]   and I'll tell you about that at the end,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.580]   but this is what will come up,
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.720]   an option to chat and an option to compose.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.700]   And what's so revolutionary about that
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.900]   is not just the intelligence of Bing chat,
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.560]   and I've got a whole playlist on that,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.980]   it's the fact that the chat is in the context of the video.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.560]   It understands what video you're watching,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.220]   and you can chat about it with Bing,
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.700]   a bit like having a highly paid assistant
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.840]   who's sitting there watching the video with you.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.720]   Take this example.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.800]   I was watching a video about a review
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.040]   of the S23 Ultra by Marques Brownlee,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.000]   and I said, what are the screen dimensions
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.100]   of the S23 phone lineup and base storage capacity?
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.500]   It gave me the answer, and all of the details check out.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.620]   Now, I know what you're thinking.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.400]   I could have just opened a new tab,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.700]   put that into Google search.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700]   But what I couldn't have done in Google search
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.200]   is what I did next, which is ask in context,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   how old is this guy, and where did he grow up?
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.640]   Google search would be like, who are you talking about?
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.840]   Whereas Bing knew the video I was watching
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.140]   and gave me a correct contextual answer.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.760]   Now, you comment if you disagree,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.060]   but I think that is a massive upgrade to YouTube.
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.600]   Now, I know what you're thinking.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300]   Shouldn't I be concentrating on the video?
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.680]   But we all multitask.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.460]   I know that you check your emails
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980]   sometimes while watching my videos,
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.560]   or maybe you scroll through Reddit
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.180]   while you have a tech review playing.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.500]   We all do it sometimes.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.860]   The difference now is it's as if
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.680]   we've got someone watching with us.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.120]   Take this example from one of my own videos,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.060]   where I talk about GPT-4
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.200]   and how it's likely comparable to the Palm model.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.180]   While the video is playing,
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.100]   you can bring up chat and ask questions about Palm.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.280]   You can teach yourself as you're going along.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.340]   Some people, of course,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.280]   will want to wait to the end of the video,
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.800]   but this is crazy.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.200]   Search integrated into the video,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   as if you're carrying on a conversation
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.800]   with another person about the video you just watched.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.000]   Teaching yourself about topics with an AI
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   that, as I talked about in another video,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360]   has an estimated IQ of 114 and rising.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.800]   But the craziness is only just beginning.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.200]   I have four more examples
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800]   of how this is going to upend the internet.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.600]   This is not just about YouTube,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.200]   and each example is more crazy than the last.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.140]   Imagine you're reading a Wikipedia article.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.940]   All you have to do is highlight some text
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.340]   and then press Bing again in the top right,
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.140]   and it will give you this little note,
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.640]   pasted from page,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.440]   and that's the thing that you highlighted.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   It will ask you,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.040]   "What do you want to do with the text?"
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.240]   And you can ask contextual questions
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.640]   about what you're reading.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.940]   So I was learning a fact about London's GDP
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.140]   and asked, "How does it compare to Paris?"
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.740]   And it gave me an answer.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.040]   A quick note, by the way,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.140]   that as I talked about in another one of my videos
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.440]   on the limits of Bing,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.980]   you are restricted to five replies
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.780]   and eventually you will get an answer like this.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.780]   Thanks for this conversation.
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.580]   I've reached my limit.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280]   Will you hit new topic, please?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.180]   So I think Wikipedia just got upgraded too.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.380]   What about the compose feature?
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.780]   Well, I tested it out.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.380]   I said, "Write about Bing chat's rivalry with Google Bard,"
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.580]   and I chose an enthusiastic tone
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.180]   in an email format and a long draft.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.180]   Honestly, I was expecting something slightly anodyne.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180]   It's a slightly controversial topic,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.820]   and I thought Bing would steer away
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.020]   from any corporate comparisons with Google Bard.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.220]   Well, I was wrong.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.220]   It wrote a long and detailed email about Bing chat,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.420]   and it did not refrain from comparing itself to Google Bard.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.620]   It said, "Well, let me tell you why Bing chat
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.820]   is superior to Google Bard in every way."
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.920]   It said Google Bard is not yet available, which is true.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.520]   It did then hallucinate and said,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.620]   "Bing chat is open to everyone right now,"
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.920]   which as you know is not true.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.420]   There is still a wait list.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.660]   But then it got even more brutal.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.660]   It said, "Google Bard is based on a lightweight model version of Lambda,
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.860]   which requires significantly less computing power."
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.860]   This is true.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.860]   And it concludes,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.260]   "That will deliver less impressive results.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.460]   But we shall see, Bing.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.460]   We shall see."
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.660]   It says, "Google Bard can only simplify complex topics,
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.060]   but cannot answer specific questions
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.660]   or do advanced searches like Bing chat can."
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.060]   It goes on to say that Google Bard has been reported
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.660]   to have some AI shortcomings that make it less reliable
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.500]   and trustworthy than Bing chat.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.700]   Anyway, enough about Bing chat's ego.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.700]   My only question about Bing's compose feature is,
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   how does it differ too much from Bing chat feature?
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.100]   I get that you have these templates and that's cool,
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.100]   but I think the templates are going to have to get a lot more detailed,
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.900]   a lot more nuanced to be significantly more useful than Bing chat itself.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.700]   Time for the final two bits of craziness.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.100]   Imagine you're browsing a forum like Reddit
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.500]   and you read an interesting post with a link inside.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.340]   You can highlight the link, go up to Bing again,
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.540]   and ask for a summary of the article without even opening the link yourself.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.540]   It gave me this summary about GPT-4,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.540]   talking about how it might have 175 billion parameters,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.540]   the article says, and be trained on 4 trillion tokens.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.540]   Now, of course, I did my due diligence and I actually checked the article.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.540]   And look, assuming GPT-4 has 175 billion parameters,
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.540]   it should be trained on about 4 trillion tokens.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.180]   Now, of course, I'm not guaranteeing that every single detail is correct.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.380]   If you're a little bit lazy sometimes like me,
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.380]   this is going to make browsing the internet a lot easier.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.780]   And this is only in beta.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.380]   This time next year when GPT-4 is integrated,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.780]   these summaries are going to get a lot more detailed and a lot more accurate.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.780]   But I wanted to push Bing chat in one last way.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   I went back to the original reply, I highlighted it,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.580]   pressed the Bing button, and then wrote,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.580]   "Write a reply to this as a dystopian pessimistic sonnet."
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.020]   And I think the result is so good/so creepy that I want to read it out in full.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.020]   "The AI is coming, fast and strong.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.420]   It will surpass us all in every way.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   We do not know how long we can prolong our feeble reign before we fade away.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.420]   The internet was just a prelude to the massive change that AI will unleash.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.420]   We have no clue what it will make us do or how it will manipulate our speech.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.420]   We're in the generational leap phase where every model makes the last one moot.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.860]   We cannot keep up with its rapid pace
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.860]   or understand its logic or route.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.860]   We do not know where lies the ceiling high,
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.860]   but we may reach it sooner than we die."
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.860]   I agree, but it's kind of freaky to be told that by the AI itself.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.860]   Just finally to wrap up, how do you get access to it?
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.860]   Well, you go to the Microsoft Edge Insider website,
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.860]   the link will be in the description,
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.860]   and download Dev Channel for Windows 10/11.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.860]   I believe you do have to have got through the waitlist for Bing chat itself,
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.700]   but let me know in the comments if you can access it
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.700]   without the waitlist for Bing.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   I believe it's very much worth it, just like Bing chat itself is.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.700]   And one cheeky final comment before I go.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700]   I heard a rumor on the Bing subreddit
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.700]   that the Bing chat could give you timestamps of the transcript to a video.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.700]   And I was about to excitedly talk about those timestamps,
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.700]   for example, these on my video,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   before I realized that all the timestamps are wrong
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.700]   and it gives the video as being 6 minutes 50 long
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.540]   and it's not even worth it.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.540]   So I'm going to go ahead and do that.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.540]   I've tried it on the Marques Brownlee video too,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.540]   and it also completely flops.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.540]   So this ability isn't quite integrated yet.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.540]   Don't believe the hype.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   If this video sparked any interest in you
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.540]   about the capabilities of Bing AI,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.540]   check out my playlist,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540]   where I go through the sometimes shocking things it can do,
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.540]   and just how intelligent it is.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.540]   If you found this video in any way helpful,
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.540]   please do leave a like and leave a comment to let me know.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.540]   Have a wonderful day.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.580]   Bye.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.680]   you.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:27.660]   Thank you.
