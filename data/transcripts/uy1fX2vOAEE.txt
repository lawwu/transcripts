[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   The following is a conversation with Jimmy Pedro,
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.160]   a legendary judo competitor and coach.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.580]   He represented the United States at four Olympics
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.140]   in '92, '96, 2000, and 2004,
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.680]   winning a bronze medal at two of them.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.480]   He medaled in three world championships,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.120]   winning gold in 1999.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.640]   He has coached many of the elite-level American judoka,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.100]   including Kayla Harrison, Ronda Rousey,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.460]   Travis Stevens, and many others.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.880]   Plus, he's now my judo coach, along with Travis Stevens.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.320]   in the description.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.240]   And now, here's my conversation with Jimmy Pedro.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.600]   What is the most beautiful throw in judo to you?
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.320]   - I think Uchimata.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080]   You know, it's the one that seems
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.560]   to have the most amplitude.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.440]   That person goes the highest.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.220]   You see a leg swing through the middle,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.400]   the person doing the throw,
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.600]   there's a leg swinging through the middle.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.040]   The other person definitely goes, you know,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.680]   head over heels, flat on their back.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.080]   It's probably the most dynamic, pretty judo throw there is.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   - Okay, so it's a single, you're standing on a single foot,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.160]   and you're raising your other foot in the air,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.760]   and it's a forward throw,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.520]   which means your back is facing the opponent,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.040]   but they kind of both fly through the air
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.480]   and twist through the air.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.520]   - Correct.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.380]   - Yeah, so how does that throw work?
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.380]   What are the principles behind that throw?
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.460]   It's one of those throws that, you know,
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.900]   people can kind of understand how to pick up
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.700]   another human being in sort of trivial ways,
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060]   but the Uchimata to me never quite made sense,
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.820]   like why it works.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.380]   There's a cork, there's a twisting motion,
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.740]   there's some involvement of the hip,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.920]   but it's not really a hip throw,
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.620]   because the hip is not all the way over,
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.220]   so it's not, it's a very confusing throw.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.060]   (laughing)
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.900]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.720]   Can you say something for once?
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.660]   - It's probably one of the most difficult throws
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.980]   to learn as well, because it is so complex.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.860]   You do have to stand on one leg, balance on one leg,
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.020]   you know, swing your other leg through the middle,
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.020]   hold your opponent up in the air,
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.100]   and it's hard to make that contact
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.740]   with upper body to your back, you know,
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.460]   you have to turn your back on the throw as well.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.640]   So how does it work?
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.860]   It's definitely sort of a throw where you need
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060]   to start pulling your opponent's upper body toward you,
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.620]   right, so their upper body starts coming toward you.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.060]   Your legs go towards them as your body
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.380]   starts to go into the throw.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.900]   So your head is gonna go left, let's say,
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.620]   your legs are gonna go to the right,
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.340]   your partner's gonna start to lean toward you,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.940]   and just as you start to get there,
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.500]   moment of coming forward,
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.360]   your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.260]   pick them up onto your hip, right,
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260]   and then the finish of the throw is a twist,
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.240]   and a lot of times the good judoka
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.580]   will leave their feet when they do the throw,
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.040]   so both bodies are in the air together,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.600]   and then the thrower comes down
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.540]   on top of the person being thrown.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.260]   - So all four feet are in the air.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.100]   - Correct.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.300]   - So there's just this unstoppable force,
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.700]   so you're all in the air,
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820]   you're basically doing a roll together.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.380]   - Correct.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.700]   - Okay, so who to you is the best uchimata,
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.540]   who has, besides yourself?
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.220]   (laughing)
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.660]   - I'm not gonna lie, there's plenty of guys
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.820]   that do uchimata a lot better than I do.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820]   - You do have a nice video about the uchimata online,
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.140]   but who's a great practitioner of the uchimata to you?
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.820]   - Right now, Shohei Ono,
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.760]   who's two-time Olympic gold medalist,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.940]   that's his favorite throw,
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.380]   and there's tons of highlight videos on the IJF
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.740]   and Judo Fanatic showing how he does his uchimata,
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.580]   and it is quite different than everybody else's,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.740]   but it's unstoppable.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.380]   When he comes in, nobody stops it.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.000]   He's won two golds in a row at the Olympics.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.500]   I think maybe in the last eight years,
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.980]   the guy's lost two matches.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.900]   You know, he's just incredible.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.740]   - At a very competitive division,
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.100]   I guess 73 kilos?
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.700]   Okay, and then three-time world champ too.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.020]   Is he the greatest of all time to you?
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.580]   - The only reason why he's not is because Nomura
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.860]   is a 60-kilo player.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.380]   He was three-time Olympic champion.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.860]   So Nomura, I mean,
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.580]   unless Ono's gonna stick around for another three years
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.620]   and win again here in Paris,
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.220]   then he'd match what Nomura did.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.400]   But three-time gold medalist in Judo
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.260]   in a lightweight division, that's pretty spectacular.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.740]   - So to you, being able to win a championship,
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.880]   world championship or Olympic medal,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.940]   is a measure of greatness.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.980]   It's not like you have some people
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.940]   who are not as accomplished like Koga or something like that
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.940]   but just the beauty, the moments of magic,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.620]   the number of moments of magic is the highest,
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.500]   even if it's not championships.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.980]   - I think you have to go by that
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.040]   because there's so many phenomenal Judo players
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.240]   that have come through the system of spectacular Judo.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.560]   You have won countless major events,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.940]   but the ability to pull it together, right,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.500]   at those magical moments, the pinnacle of the sport,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.740]   the world championships, the Olympic games,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.580]   and proving that you can do it time and time again
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.460]   makes you unstoppable, it makes you the best.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.140]   There was a guy back in the '70s and '80s
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.460]   by the name of Fuji,
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.300]   and he won four world championships back-to-back.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.060]   And back then, the world's was every two years.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.660]   So here he was, a four-time world champion.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.980]   That's eight years at the top of the sport.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.720]   He never won an Olympic medal.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.560]   He never went to the Olympics.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.840]   So there's a guy who missed out on Olympic greatness
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.520]   but was arguably the best competitor back in that period.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.300]   - By the way, same Fuji as Fuji?
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.140]   - Right.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.040]   - Really, okay.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.600]   Wow, I didn't know there was an actual guy, Fuji.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.560]   - Our brand is named after the mountain, Mount Fuji.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.600]   But this is a different guy, his name was Fuji.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.540]   - All right, well, history rhymes.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   What about Teddy Renner, 10-time world champ, I think,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   two-time gold medalist at the Olympics,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.520]   two-times bronze medalist at the Olympics,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.360]   probably the most dominant judoka ever.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.280]   Is he in the running?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.000]   What do you think about that guy?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.160]   - I think he's a freak of nature, Teddy.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.580]   If you look at the size, just how big, how tall he is,
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.720]   how big he is, how physical he is of a specimen.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.680]   I sat next to him on a bus
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   and his legs are literally the size of my waist.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.120]   When you sit next to him and just look at the size,
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.200]   he's a big man.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Obviously, to win 10 world titles in the sport of judo,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.840]   I mean, that's almost an incomprehensible feat,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.620]   two-time Olympic champion, again.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.080]   That puts him in one of the maybe 10 or 12 people
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.280]   that ever do that in the history of the sport.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   So he's definitely got to be in the running for the best.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.680]   But technically, I don't think he's as technical
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.680]   as some of the other in terms of pure judo finesse technique.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.120]   He's powerful, he's explosive, he's dominant, he's strong.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.080]   Teddy also grips really, really well,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.460]   which makes him that much tougher to beat
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.240]   because a lot of times heavyweights,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.160]   especially in the heavyweight division,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.800]   a lot of them just grab the gi
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.960]   and they go man to man and judo to judo
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.280]   and take shots at each other.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.640]   And that's why a lot of them end up getting beat.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.240]   But Teddy's in control.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.920]   Positionally, he stays in really good position
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.960]   and he controls his opponent the whole fight.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.280]   So they really don't have a chance against him.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.160]   He doesn't give them a chance to beat him,
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.680]   which is why he's been so dominant.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.440]   - But he's not really stalling.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.680]   So I mean, he does have a really nice,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.560]   Osorogari, this backward trip, outside trip,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.120]   in case people don't know.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.000]   I mean, he has just like technically pretty good throws
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.480]   and for heavyweight.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.300]   - Yes.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.880]   - Heavyweights can be sometimes messy with their judo.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.600]   He's pretty technical and clean
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.080]   in the execution of his big throws.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   But a lot of that probably has to do
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.360]   with the dominant gripping that he does.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.640]   It's not defensive gripping, it's offensive gripping,
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   but the dominant gripping.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.120]   - 100%.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.040]   - He controls the grips, he controls the movement
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.920]   of the match as a result of that.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.720]   And then he creates his own openings.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.320]   So I mean, for a heavyweight, phenomenal technique, yes.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.160]   And what you said, messy, I'd like to call it sloppy.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.480]   Right, a lot of the heavyweights tend to be sloppy.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.520]   They fall on the ground a lot.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.480]   It's hard to move somebody that weighs 350 pounds.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.000]   It's hard to get that body moving
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.400]   and just with a simple pull motion.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.920]   So he's definitely found a way to do it.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.720]   But he's also, I don't know, six foot eight.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.560]   - Yeah.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.440]   - He probably weighs 140 kilos.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.800]   He's a big boy.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.200]   - But he had this winning streak of just,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.000]   I don't know how long, but over 100 matches.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.360]   And he lost at this Olympics that we just went through,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.280]   the 20, I don't even know what to call it, 2021 Olympics.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.800]   I don't know the proper terminology.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.080]   - Tokyo 2020.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.200]   - Tokyo 2020, all right.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.080]   So he lost to Tamerlan Bashev.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   - I mean, it's always sad to see a sort of greatness
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.160]   come to an end.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.040]   It's like Karellin in wrestling and Greco Roman.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.080]   Did you shed a bit of a tear to see greatness go?
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.440]   Or is it just the way of life?
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.520]   I mean, what did you think about sort of this dominance,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.800]   this run of dominance being stopped?
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.600]   - I think, I mean, it's obviously sad to see LFC
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.360]   and champions succeed, especially people
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.440]   that are good people.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.360]   And I think Teddy's a good person.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.280]   I mean, I think there's some arrogant champions
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.040]   that everybody would like to see lose
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.880]   just because they don't wanna deal with their personality.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.960]   And I think Teddy's a very humble champion.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.480]   He's a people's champion.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.720]   I think he's been privileged and he makes good money
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.680]   from the sport of judo and the French Federation
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.840]   has taken care of him well.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.320]   So he's a lifelong judo icon.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.600]   So it's sad to see somebody like that get beat,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.160]   especially when this could have been
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   his third Olympic title and just put him in infamy.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   So it was sad to see, but I think every athlete
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.080]   goes through it, right?
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.840]   I mean, it's just, that's what the Olympics is all about.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.480]   The great ones fall sometimes.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.520]   - Especially in judo, it's like so,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.000]   like the margin of error.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.360]   I mean, I guess the other question I wanna ask here is,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.320]   in your sense, how difficult it is to not lose for so long.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.840]   It seems like in judo, like a little mistake and it's over.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.440]   There's no coming back and Ippon means it's over.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.960]   So how difficult is that?
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.160]   - It's hard to stay that dominant without question.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.000]   First of all, when you are the entire world
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.240]   is training against you just to beat you.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.880]   They're studying every single movement.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.320]   They're studying patterns.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.680]   They're trying to break it down
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   and find a flaw in your game.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.400]   So everybody's hunting for you
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   when you're the best in the world,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.240]   especially at the Olympics.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.960]   That's the one to beat you at.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.000]   So everybody's focused on you.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.440]   And then there's an incredible amount of pressure
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.040]   on that athlete to perform.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   You carry the flag for your country.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.320]   When you're in opening ceremonies, sometimes,
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.880]   there's all spotlight is on you.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.320]   And it's particularly hard when things don't go well early.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.200]   In other words, when you're expected to win
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.640]   and then all of a sudden now you're in a hard fight
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.200]   and it's not going the way you want,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.160]   that pressure, the one who's the favorite
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.000]   feels the pressure the most at the Olympics.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.880]   And that's why I think the other ones are able to win it.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.640]   - I've actually never gotten a chance
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.480]   to listen to Teddy Renner sort of explain
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.920]   ideas behind his Judo.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.760]   Like I wonder what his mental game is like
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.840]   'cause I think his English is pretty not very good.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.800]   And so, and I just haven't seen good interviews,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.520]   but it's always fascinating to,
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.440]   there's certain great athletes
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.600]   that are also great thinkers and speakers,
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.160]   like the Satya brothers in wrestling.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.720]   Again, not meaning, that's on my to-do list, 100%.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.200]   I'm going to Dagestan and talking to them
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.640]   because they're brilliant.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.360]   But to be able to sort of, maybe after retirement,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.580]   to think back, what were the systems involved,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.880]   both on the technical, the training side,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.520]   and then the mental side.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.600]   'Cause to stay that dominant, just like you're saying,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.520]   everybody's studying to beat you.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.240]   And the heavyweights are just these powerful dudes.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.320]   So to be able to control them with your game
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.640]   and the game that everybody knows is coming is,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.760]   I don't know, I don't know what's behind that,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.080]   but there's got to be,
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.920]   it feels like the mental game is exceptionally important.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.560]   - I think a lot of people underestimate
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.200]   just how important that side is.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   Being mentally prepared for victory,
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.160]   mentally prepared to be the best, to stay the best.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.440]   There's nobody that's weak-minded
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.480]   that can accomplish that.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.560]   It's 100% confidence and belief in yourself.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.640]   - If we take a big picture view then,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.960]   not necessarily Tate Rene,
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.600]   but if you want to go from the very beginning,
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   from day one of judo class to Olympic champion
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.040]   or Olympic medalist,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.160]   what does it take to become an Olympic medalist in judo
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.000]   from start to finish?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.360]   Like how many different trajectories do you see?
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.720]   Or is there some unifying principles?
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.160]   - I think a lot of it has to,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.000]   your journey is going to depend a lot by where you're from.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.120]   So a path that an American might take
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.960]   versus somebody who's from Japan
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.800]   or somebody who's from Europe.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.680]   There's two very, three very distinct paths, right?
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.960]   'Cause in Japan, it's part of the culture.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.280]   There's a system of excellence.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.680]   There's elementary school judo,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.960]   there's junior high school,
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.640]   there's high school, there's collegiate,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.800]   there's Olympic.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   And much like our wrestling is here in the United States,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.320]   it's very similar.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.880]   There's youth wrestling, there's high school,
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.240]   there's NCAA, and then there's Olympic wrestling.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.000]   And when your country is a factory
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.120]   of producing athletes at the highest level,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.640]   then all of those top athletes
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.280]   typically go back into the sport
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.560]   and there's professions for them.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.880]   They have an opportunity to coach
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.480]   at all those different levels.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.360]   And just the level of their game
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.720]   and the expertise that all of them have,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.600]   even down at the elementary level,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.200]   make their skill so solid.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.000]   - And as a coach in that situation,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.640]   you can just sit back and watch who stands out
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.200]   as opposed to, I think in America, I guess,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.240]   you would need to craft.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.440]   You don't get to choose from a thousand people,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.200]   a few people that naturally stand out at the age of nine.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.840]   You have to actually,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.480]   whatever the natural resources you're given,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.780]   craft them into a champion.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.200]   So if we look at that, the American way,
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.240]   where you just have a person with a smile
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.320]   show up to your dojo,
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   says I want to be an Olympic medalist.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.040]   What process do you take them through?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.360]   - The odds are really insurmountable.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.600]   It's a very, very high hill to climb.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.040]   And there's only a few people
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.680]   and there's only a few coaches in this entire country
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.120]   that really understand that process
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.280]   and that can help people reach that level,
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.080]   as it's been proven, right?
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   Number one, you certainly have to have a solid base,
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.240]   a fundamental base of an expectation
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.120]   of what the training is going to be.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.680]   And it has to be a level of professionalism
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.760]   very, very early,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.800]   where you're teaching all the basic judo moves,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   all the basic fundamental movements,
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.520]   posture, gripping,
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.120]   well, maybe gripping doesn't come in so early in the game,
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.600]   but throwing methodology, movements,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.840]   nawaza position, standing fundamental throws,
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.920]   and I think most importantly is really the work ethic.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.760]   Just the way you're going to train,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.360]   the intensity you're going to train with,
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.120]   the ability to, the mindset of going to tournaments
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.320]   constantly in order to compete with the rest of the world.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Our young kids need to be tested a lot when they're young.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.400]   They have to be put through adversity
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.240]   because they don't get put through adversity in training
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.000]   'cause you don't have that many good training partners.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.760]   So you get put through adversity in competition
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.520]   and then do we see what your weaknesses are
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.560]   and we continue to make improvements on those.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.000]   But the journey is, it's long.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.120]   And until they're kind of at the teenage years,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.160]   they're going to have to pretty much stay domestic, right?
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.560]   'Cause they got to go through life as a normal kid,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.240]   but they've got to be training in the dojo
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.040]   at least five days a week.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.800]   Sometimes they might want to get
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.360]   an extra technical workout in
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.200]   or doing some base conditioning in addition to that.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.720]   And then really at the teenage years,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.760]   that's where we really, we've struggled in America
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.920]   of keeping teens in the sport of judo
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.520]   as well as developing them properly.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.280]   'Cause up until around the teenage years,
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.280]   I think the Americans are on par with the rest of the world
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800]   in terms of technique and in terms of skill.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.920]   And we've proven we can compete
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.600]   with the rest of the world up until that age.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.760]   But that's where Japan and that's where the Europeans
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.920]   and the countries that are strong in judo,
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.400]   that's where they put a lot of time, energy and effort
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.120]   is it to the teens where they have a great coaching staff,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.960]   they have good training camps with 800,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.680]   a thousand people going to them every single weekend.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.280]   - When you say teens, what do you mean?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.000]   Do you mean literally like 13?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.480]   - Yeah, age 13 to 17, 13 to 19.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.560]   - And that's where sort of,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.680]   that's when you really accelerate your development.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.160]   So you're saying like in America, when you're young,
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   like before nine, 10, 11, 12, you stick in judo,
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.120]   you can progress quite a bit.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.880]   But then I guess the other competition there,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   if you're into two people doing stuff to each other
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:39.000]   in a combative way,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.640]   the other competitor in America is wrestling.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.800]   So judo almost primes you,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.560]   like it teaches you how to be a great wrestler as well.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.760]   And so then you have to have a hard decision
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.720]   because you can probably be a collegiate wrestler.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.080]   You have like a clear plan of where you're going to go
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.040]   if you wanna be a wrestler.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   With judo, that plan is less clear.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.360]   So you have to be on your own a bit with your coach,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.200]   that kind of thing.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.120]   - Exactly.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.440]   - Okay, so when you're on your own with your coach,
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.200]   to me, that's just a fascinating journey
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   'cause then it's just like the purity of it.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.700]   It's the coach and the athlete and the dream.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   It's all about the dedication,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.480]   the five, six, seven days a week competing,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.100]   what, once a month?
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.360]   Twice a month?
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.400]   - Twice a month.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.960]   - Okay, but also you probably don't have that conversation.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.800]   I don't know if you do.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.440]   Maybe you do, saying like,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.840]   we're gonna do this for the next eight years.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.080]   (laughing)
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.920]   - Right.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.080]   - Do you ever sit down with Jesus
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.040]   to take it the David Goggins way,
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.760]   which is like, let's just take it one step at a time.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.760]   (laughing)
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.080]   Let's hope we're there in eight years.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.200]   - Yeah, let's hope we're there.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.040]   Do you actually--
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.200]   - Well, no, like right now, you have to think about,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.060]   the Olympics is gonna be in Los Angeles in 2028.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.280]   So it's really interesting.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.640]   Now would be the time, and now is the time,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.520]   to identify talent and get commitment out of students
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.920]   that in seven years, you can make a US Olympic team
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.320]   because we're gonna have a full team.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.200]   America's gonna have 14 athletes compete in those games,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.680]   one in every weight class.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.760]   So now's the time, if you're gonna go on a journey
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.000]   to the Olympics and stay with the sport of judo,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.560]   now would be the time to do it.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.240]   - And so what, you show up to the Pedro Judo Center
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.600]   and how much drilling,
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.840]   how much technique strategy discussions,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.080]   how much randori or like live sparring,
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.880]   how much conditioning and strength training,
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.120]   how much of all that?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.320]   How much of cross training to other gyms
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.760]   or something like that, traveling abroad?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.240]   Is there something to be said about us,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.560]   some aspects of that system?
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.720]   - For sure.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.160]   You need it all, what you just said, you need all of it.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.260]   And we do do all of that.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.120]   Right now, we have a young group of kids at the academy,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.020]   you'll see tonight.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.400]   Some of them are 14, 13, 15, 17.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.240]   - Are they good?
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.080]   - Yeah, really good.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.640]   - Okay, can't wait.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   - And they're right around your weight,
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.480]   so it'll be perfect.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.920]   (laughing)
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.840]   They're just young boys,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.560]   but they've been training hard through COVID.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.800]   We've been, Travis and myself have been training them.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.240]   We share responsibilities.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.920]   They're doing randori like five nights a week.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.000]   We have them doing randori Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.520]   Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   is when they're doing randori.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.840]   They're coming to the dojo Friday night
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.400]   and Sunday night to do training.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.600]   We also have technical sessions for them.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.660]   They're in school now, so it's a little bit challenging,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.520]   but they come five o'clock in the afternoon
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.240]   and they do a technical session.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.360]   Through COVID, they were coming every morning
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.760]   doing technical sessions.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.160]   - What's a technical session?
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.240]   - It's an hour of repetitive throwing
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.260]   or repetitive drilling to reinforce movements
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.120]   that we deem important to our successful system.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.080]   So, nawaza positions, groundwork positions
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.240]   where we want them to be in this position
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.400]   and they're gonna drill it 50 times
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.960]   with resistance, in big groups,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.080]   doing drills over and over again,
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.320]   picking apart the details of the technique
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.360]   and what they're doing wrong,
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.920]   showing them how to fix it.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.320]   But now we've done it so much
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.640]   that now we can do a whole drill session with them
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.600]   where they know all the different techniques
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.200]   inside and out and they can move
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.000]   from position to position really quickly.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.760]   - Do they do it for a period of time,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.920]   like two minutes, five minutes,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.040]   or is it like one, two, they're actually counting?
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.720]   - No, sometimes it's both.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.200]   So, sometimes we do it for reps,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.040]   sometimes we do it for time.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.640]   Yeah, so sometimes it might be as many as they can do
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.000]   in 60 seconds or as many as they can do in two minutes.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.320]   And sometimes it might just be,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.840]   I want you to do every position five times.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.680]   - In terms of throws,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.640]   we're not talking about on a crash pad, right?
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.480]   It's just--
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.600]   - We're talking about free moving around the mat.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.520]   - And just dynamically and just throwing.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.360]   - Correct.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.840]   - How many, because as I was mentioning to you offline,
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.280]   Travis threw me a few times,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.760]   a lot of times when he was visiting in Austin.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.040]   And I just remembered,
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.920]   so there's two things,
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.440]   fortunately or unfortunately in my life,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.360]   having gotten a chance to train with folks of that level,
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.240]   with just cleanness of throw and the power.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.640]   And it was very nice.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.040]   I immediately actually enjoyed being thrown like that.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.160]   To throw a little shade at Craig Jones
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.840]   with his current mat situation,
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.400]   is they're very, they were quite thin.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.200]   And as Travis commented on,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.800]   and not just the thinness of the mats,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.960]   but they were laid on like concrete.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.800]   - Right.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.280]   - So I felt, it's like soft until it's not.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.840]   But being thrown very cleanly,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.080]   I just felt like there's,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.120]   this is not gonna lead to injury, it was great.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.040]   It wasn't injury prone.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.920]   But then as I mentioned to you,
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.960]   when I, day or two after,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.240]   my entire leg, one of them,
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.600]   I guess it's the left leg,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.360]   was just black, a bruise.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.680]   - It didn't hurt too bad,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.480]   but it was just the body's gotten soft.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.080]   So I guess the question I have is,
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.440]   does the body get used to just that number of throws?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.280]   Just over time, being thrown thousands of times a month?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.320]   - Unquestionably.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.760]   Your body gets used to it.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.880]   So it hardens, it gets really hard.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.920]   Which is why judo is hard to come back to
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.760]   after you've taken a long period of time off,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.880]   because your body is not used to that impact anymore.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.240]   And I always found out that when I was training judo a lot,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.120]   it's hard to shed weight and keep weight off,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.680]   because your body, it develops this layer of protection
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.040]   on itself that it doesn't wanna give up.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.120]   When you're sucking a lot of weight,
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.560]   that means you're frail.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.160]   So I always seem to retain weight more
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.560]   when you're doing hard judo training,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.920]   as opposed to losing weight.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.320]   It's easy when you go out for runs and things like that
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.580]   to shed the water weight,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.580]   but to actually keep the pounds off was--
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.480]   - Yeah. - Pretty hard.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.560]   - Yeah, the body kinda develops, like you said,
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.780]   a level of protection.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.440]   What about, Duran, Dory, just out of curiosity,
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.360]   again, I haven't ever had the opportunity
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.380]   to train with folks at a high level.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:26.600]   In jiu-jitsu, there's different gyms at different styles,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.200]   but I've noticed that at the highest levels,
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   people can go pretty hard in a certain kind of way
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.600]   where it's more technical,
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.580]   and you're moving at 100%,
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.620]   but the power is not at 100%.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.660]   It's a weird little dance.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.080]   You're not really forcing stuff.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.860]   You're more focused on the right timing,
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:58.140]   the right positioning of hands and feet and body
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.120]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.220]   You're not forcing stuff in
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.140]   the way you would in competition, really the power.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.560]   Does that sound similar to you
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.240]   for the way you try to do Randori?
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.920]   - So there's different styles of judo,
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.760]   and I'd say the Japanese style,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.160]   the technical style of judo
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.800]   is exactly what you just talked about.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.320]   It's almost like two guys in pajamas, right?
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.720]   We're not using minimal effort, maximum efficiency.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.680]   We're moving around, and we're trying to feel that movement,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.960]   and it's timing and finesse and technique
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.080]   and fun and clean throws.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.840]   And when you train in Japan,
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.720]   you can train 15 rounds of Randori,
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.640]   five-minute rounds, that's 75 minutes of straight sparring.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.480]   You can do that straight in Japan without a problem.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.840]   I mean, you'll get tired, of course.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.960]   You're gonna fall a lot.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   You're gonna throw a lot,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.120]   but it's very free-feeling,
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.360]   and it's technical, as you explained.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.880]   But then when you go to Europe
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.900]   and you try to do rounds with the Europeans,
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.200]   they are very physical.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.960]   They don't have that same finesse in their training
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.360]   that they do in Japan.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.200]   And in Europe, you'd be hard-pressed
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.320]   to do eight rounds of Randori in a night.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.400]   It's so physically exhausting
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.480]   because so much effort is going into just fighting
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   and fending off the gripping system
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.560]   and the power of your opponent.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.280]   You're physically drained after eight rounds of Randori.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.320]   So it's a much different feel.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.720]   - When you say Europe, do you mean Germany,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.960]   France, Britain, Russia?
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.800]   Is there a lot?
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.040]   So there's a kind of similarity
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.840]   to all of those kinds of approaches.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.080]   - The only difference would be Russia,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.840]   they do a lot more active drilling,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.460]   a lot more sequential movement training.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.960]   They don't focus as much on Randori.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.480]   You'll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.080]   than you would in those other countries
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.780]   we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.920]   - What about in this kind of American system
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.440]   where you have much less talent to work with?
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:00.040]   Just select whatever works for the particular athletes
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.600]   or do you have something you prefer in your system?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.520]   - So you need a combination of all of it.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.960]   If you're gonna win at the Olympic level,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.200]   you have to be able to deal with the finesse
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.340]   of the Japanese, the physicality of the Europeans.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.560]   You have to focus on the ground,
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.240]   the waza aspect because a lot of people are weak there
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.760]   in the world of the sport of judo.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.400]   That's a chance to win.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.880]   We've sort of developed our American system of judo,
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.360]   at least for the last, I'd say probably the last 20 years,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.960]   it'd be the American system of judo,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.640]   which relies heavily on taking the individual
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.080]   and whatever techniques they do,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.760]   perfecting those techniques and the combinations
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.060]   and other throws that go with those throws,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.200]   but then implementing and overlaying an American system
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.680]   of gripping, nawaza, conditioning, mentality,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.560]   training methodology, like in game planning,
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.600]   to beat your opponents.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.620]   And I think that's the secret sauce to success
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.380]   for Americans 'cause there's no way,
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.980]   if we don't have eight partners to train with in a night
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.720]   that are gonna give us good rounds, right?
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.300]   We might have two, so we gotta have the same guy
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.920]   four times, those two people, two times each.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.100]   Now I have four good rounds.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.540]   The rest of the rounds, I'm not being pushed to the limit.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.860]   So we train differently.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.180]   And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.220]   When our athletes are preparing for competition,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.000]   for example, when Kayla or Travis
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.620]   were preparing for competition,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.340]   we might only have 20 people in the whole gym
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.260]   to work out with, those two Olympic medalists, right?
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.880]   And of those 20 people, maybe four of them are Travis' size.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.300]   Maybe there's only one girl in the room for Kayla.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.480]   She's gotta train with guys.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.900]   And then the other ones are teenagers that are too weak
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.460]   to train with either one of them.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.120]   So what we would do is just put together four or five people
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.460]   that could give them a challenge and we'd line them up
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.740]   and they would do a minute, a minute, a minute, a minute,
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.560]   and they'd do five minutes in a row as hard as they can.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.460]   That person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.800]   They can't go five minutes hard,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.260]   but they can go one minute hard.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.700]   So it made their training much, much more intense,
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.340]   much more physically demanding.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.180]   And then rinse and repeat that six times
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.980]   or eight times in a night.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.700]   You know, they just got 40 minutes of intense randori.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.300]   The person that was training with them that wasn't as good
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.020]   only had to do six or eight minutes of training
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.860]   the whole night.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.680]   - Yeah.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.820]   - You know, so.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.500]   - It's so, it's so difficult.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.100]   'Cause then you look at like the Russian national team
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:30.020]   and you have just the world champions and so,
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:36.580]   or you even have like, what is it,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.680]   Tom Brands and Terry Brands in the wrestling system.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.080]   You have like these people, it's a small group of people,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.740]   but they're all some of the best people in the world
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.540]   and they're going head to head.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.000]   And yeah, you don't necessarily get a good look
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   at a variety of styles, but just the qualities there.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.660]   And even that is missing for people your size in America.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.340]   'Cause that is so difficult to work with,
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.500]   which it makes scale as it makes Travis's story
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.260]   that much more amazing.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.900]   Is, you mentioned kind of picking whatever the set
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.660]   of techniques the athlete is naturally good at
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.900]   or prefers or whatever.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.700]   How much specialization is there?
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.600]   Maybe if I give you like two choices,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.200]   is it good to have like one throw
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.000]   and try to become the best person in the world
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.920]   at that throw?
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.020]   Or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.960]   Like a variety of throws?
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.720]   - Well, for Travis, it was Ippon Seinagi.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.440]   That was his main throw, right?
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.360]   But from that Ippon Seinagi,
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.120]   he had a variety of other attacks he could do,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.320]   you know, that mixed it up so that you kept people guessing.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.120]   Maybe it wasn't the Ippon Seiwa's come
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.440]   and maybe it was the Koshi Groomer that he did.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.260]   Or maybe it was the Ippon to Osoto
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.460]   that he did in combination.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.100]   So you typically have one main throw that you do.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.860]   For me, it was Tai Otoshi.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.860]   For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.220]   For Travis, it was his Ippon Seinagi.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.140]   But then you come up with a variety of other throws
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.420]   that you do from the very same grip.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.380]   So whatever grip you take for your main throw,
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.660]   you want to develop, you know, an arsenal of attacks
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.380]   that go in all different directions,
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.100]   holding that same grip.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.300]   So you keep your opponent guessing as to what's coming.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.900]   You know, because if they're just sitting on one technique
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.320]   at the highest level of sport,
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.780]   with the exception of a few, right?
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.180]   We talked about Ono's Uchimata.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.460]   With the exception of a few,
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.500]   most of the world catches on pretty quick
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.860]   on how to beat you.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.020]   - There is something to just sticking,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.240]   making sure you really dedicate to the main thing.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.700]   So for Travis, that would be like the main version
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.420]   of his Seinagi.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.900]   Like really making sure you don't forget
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.200]   to really put in the time on that.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Because, I mean, one way to say it is
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.960]   that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.180]   - Right.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.280]   - But also, I don't know.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.340]   I think I'm just, as a fan, I think it's sad
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.280]   when like elite level athletes in all like combat sports
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.520]   kind of start taking their main thing for granted.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.540]   Like they think, okay, I've figured that part out.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.720]   Now I'll be working on this whole system on variations,
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.220]   on different setups, on lefty versus lefty,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.160]   some like weird variation, as opposed to, you know what?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.380]   If you look at some of the best people ever,
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.840]   they seem to have not cared about variations at all.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.580]   They're just like literally,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.740]   they are more like Giro Dreams of Sushi
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.480]   and like fine tuning their ear,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.620]   their ability to detect the minute movements
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.240]   that give you an opening on that main thing.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.700]   And so the whole time you're just waiting for that throw.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.880]   You're like dancing with a little bit of pressure
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.600]   and like releasing the pressure and putting the pressure,
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   maybe a little bit off balance
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.920]   and finding like the right moment to strike
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.420]   and focusing on that.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.160]   Again, maybe that's just like a romanticization
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.940]   of like the simplicity of that.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.120]   Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.300]   on the large scale, but I just,
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.960]   yeah, I don't know if you can comment on that,
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.480]   whether there is some value in still putting in like
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.440]   tens of thousands of reps on the main, main thing.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.840]   - Well, unquestionably that has to happen.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.080]   You still have to drill your main throw
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.540]   and you have to fine tune it and continue to do,
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.280]   you know, repetition after repetition
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.040]   and throws on the crash pad, you know,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.740]   or throws on the mat, moving around,
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.120]   just explosive movements doing your main technique.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.280]   You're never gonna forget that
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.040]   and you're not gonna put it to the side
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.120]   and not practice it anymore.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   It still has to be part of your repertoire
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.680]   and part of your daily training, but you do have to evolve.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.520]   And I think that's,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.120]   and I think that's the sport of judo makes you evolve.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.960]   You know, when I look at,
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.880]   we talk about Koga from before, right?
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.400]   And we talked about he had a dynamic,
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.800]   he pulled on say an Aggie that nobody could stop
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.880]   for years and years and years.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.000]   But when people started to, you know,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.480]   be unorthodox and come down his back and cross grip him
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.520]   and he couldn't get to the lapel,
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.880]   he had to come up with something else.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.800]   And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.680]   now he did a Sode, or now he did a Tomoe Nagi,
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.440]   which so he can, he added to his arsenal, you know,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   to keep people thinking, keep people guessing.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.720]   So it's not, you're not just that one trick pony.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.200]   They still couldn't stop his Ippon Seinagi
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.760]   once he got that grip.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.680]   But if they stopped him from getting that grip
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.400]   or putting two hands on the gi,
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.700]   he had to go to something else.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.960]   And that's what he did.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.680]   - Does Travis's or Koga's Seinagi make sense to you?
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.960]   That weird, so when I--
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.800]   - Split hip.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.280]   - Split hip, split hip.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.740]   So I don't know if you know this,
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.660]   but like I got into Judo 'cause of Travis.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.320]   I watched him at 2008 Olympics.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.440]   And I was, there's something about like,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.160]   just not the cockiness, but the confidence
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.480]   and just the refusal to quit, the refusal to,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.000]   just that energy, whatever it connected with me,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.120]   it's like, oh, that guy's bad-ass.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.160]   I wanna be bad-ass like that.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.840]   And then I also there happened to be
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.720]   in my university Judo and I got into it
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.120]   and just fell in love with the elegance
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.160]   and the beauty and the power of the sport.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:18.560]   But also I started to mimic Travis's game, his and Koga's.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.880]   And then the instructors I worked with,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.320]   they said, that's the wrong way to do it.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.440]   And I always, I never found somebody that told me like,
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.720]   no, that's not the wrong way to,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.160]   there's a lot of ways to do it.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.640]   And there's like the classic way and you have to understand
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.040]   and you have to learn it, but this is not the wrong way.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.560]   'Cause I was trying to find somebody
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.120]   who understands this throw.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.440]   'Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level,
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.280]   especially with Koga, the way you're able,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.000]   the quickness with which you can strike,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.720]   the fact that you can stand on the feet
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.200]   and the elevation you can get and the power you can get.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.160]   It has certain throws, just like Uchimata
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.000]   doesn't look powerful.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.440]   It just like, it looks effortless.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.800]   But like the standing Senagi with a split hip,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.280]   it just looks powerful because there's a,
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.640]   you're like, you're stepping into them,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.800]   you're lifting the opponent and they still have,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.240]   they're not surprised, they're now like helpless.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.720]   - Right, their feet are fluttering in the air.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.840]   - Fluttering.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.920]   And then there's just this pause and then just big slam.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.640]   With Uchimata, it's almost like you don't know what hit you.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.040]   It's like Taito, she's the same.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.880]   It's almost like a surprise, like, oh shit,
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.200]   I'm now on my back.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   And so I just love that throw,
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.420]   but like it didn't make sense to me.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.920]   Like when trying to explain it to others,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.400]   when trying to learn, it didn't make sense to me
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.240]   how it works.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.480]   Does it make sense to you?
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.320]   - It does.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.160]   I was born a Judoka, right?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.520]   So I've lived this stuff since I was an infant.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.340]   And I've seen every style and every technique.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.040]   The split hip seoi nage is difficult to learn.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.960]   It's harder to learn than the basic form,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.120]   but it is powerful and it does, upon entry,
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.480]   both your opponent's feet leave the mat at the same time.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.320]   So you've got them.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.680]   Once you enter, you've got them.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.840]   You just got to finish, right?
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.400]   You just got to lock them and turn and go.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.200]   So it makes sense to me.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.080]   My dad did teach me how to do that when I was younger.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.460]   Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.380]   We have kids at the school today
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.100]   that we teach the split hip seoi nage, same way,
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.580]   because it is that dynamic, right?
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.440]   You don't drop to the ground and roll and turn.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.960]   It's not the classic form
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.280]   where you're giving way to your opponent.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.680]   It's actually, you go pick the guy up in the air
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.780]   and then you slam him.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.960]   - Okay.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.200]   Beautiful.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.040]   So maybe on a small tangent,
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.420]   so we're talking about elite level athletes
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.240]   in terms of randori, in terms of like drilling,
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.020]   for more recreational athletes,
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.440]   like I have personally that situation going on,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440]   but there's other people
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.100]   that are just recreationally training judo.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.000]   How do you recommend they improve judo?
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.480]   If I wanted to compete a bunch
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.160]   and do reasonable with a particular set of throws,
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.600]   say the split seoi nage,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.360]   so how do you, do you do the randori?
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.640]   Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.340]   Do you, like, what do you recommend?
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.920]   - So I guess there's two recreational people
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.760]   that we're talking about.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.880]   One is somebody who wants to learn judo
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.440]   and become good at judo,
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.680]   but doesn't necessarily want to compete,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   but just wants to get better.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.480]   And I think that there's not enough emphasis
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.800]   in this country on paying attention
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.960]   to that type of student.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.120]   Everybody pushes them to competition,
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.400]   but in reality, there's a huge audience of people out there
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.880]   that would love to learn judo
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.800]   and be very proficient at judo
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.120]   and have the skills to go execute if they ever needed it.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.840]   And there's a class and there should be a program
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.760]   for that athlete.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.560]   And that athlete does not need to do randori.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.080]   Like, the sport of judo is physical enough
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.960]   where you're picking somebody up all the time
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.720]   and moving their body weight around the mat all the time,
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.800]   where you can get very physically strong,
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.360]   very physically fit.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.240]   Technically, you'll be better than somebody
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.920]   that does randori more than you,
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.320]   because if you learn good technique
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.400]   and you learn the movement and you learn the feel
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.720]   and you learn the timing,
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.220]   you'll actually be a better athlete
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.240]   than the person that just focuses on randori,
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.760]   who does ugly technique and wins with force.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.700]   So, we have a recreational class at our school
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.200]   where they don't do any randori.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.640]   They have an option afterwards
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.120]   if they wanna stay for 15 minutes or stay for 30 minutes
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.200]   where they can participate in randori,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.120]   but most of the adult students choose not to,
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.240]   because they're already so tired from the other hour class.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.080]   - It's a good workout.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.520]   - Right, they're already dripping sweat.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   They're already like, if you work hard and drill hard,
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.400]   it's an intense workout, you're exhausted.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.840]   So, that's a specific set of program,
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.200]   I should say, at every academy.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.720]   And then, if you wanna get good and you wanna compete,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.520]   then to me, once you have your techniques,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.320]   it's learning how to implement a good gripping system
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   to put yourself in a position
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.660]   where you can always dominate the grips,
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.840]   control the movement,
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.120]   initiate the reactions from your opponent,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.560]   and then have the opportunity to attack and score.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.440]   And I think that when people train with,
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.080]   or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo,
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.360]   all of a sudden, the first thing they say is, I can't attack.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.400]   I don't know how to attack,
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.560]   'cause positionally, they don't know where
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.440]   to put their hands,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.820]   they don't know how to hold the gi properly,
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.040]   they don't understand that they have an inferior grip,
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.480]   and they don't know how to get into better position
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.360]   so they can attack.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.560]   And that's a big part of the game
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.720]   that not a lot of people really understand.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   So you really, even for recreational competitors,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.880]   you really need to have a gripping system.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.180]   You need to understand the gripping system.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.520]   - If you want to win.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.360]   - Yeah.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.640]   - I mean, if the goal is to go and compete,
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.880]   that's a different story.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.800]   I don't have fun getting beat up or losing in competitions.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.920]   I enjoy the--
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.200]   - I don't even know if it's the winning or the losing.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   I think this is what, 'cause I competed a lot
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.280]   in both judo and jiu-jitsu,
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.080]   and in judo, it feels like,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.960]   'cause I didn't have a gripping system,
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.840]   it feels like you're not even playing judo
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.260]   against the good black belts.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.320]   They're not even trying
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.800]   because they get a certain kind of grip
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.320]   and you just can't do anything.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.080]   And I don't have a good answer for that.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.880]   I don't even know what I'm looking for.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.120]   And so it's not even fun.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.760]   It's not like even losing.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.680]   It's like, I don't know,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.480]   it's like you didn't even show up to play,
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.640]   is what it feels like.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.980]   And it's not for, and I think that is a big gap
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:52.980]   in knowledge actually in judo schools,
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.720]   is the gripping part.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.440]   - When you first go out to do judo,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.320]   the first thing you have to do
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.880]   is you have to grab your opponent.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.160]   And a lot of times I hear coaches say,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.800]   "Get a grip, just take a grip."
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.280]   Well, sometimes if you take a grip,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.480]   you're in a worse position than not having a grip at all.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.160]   That's what a lot of people don't understand.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.360]   If you hold the gi in the wrong way,
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.920]   your opponent can attack you, but you can't attack him.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.260]   So why would you ever do that grip
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.000]   if it's only to your detriment?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.860]   And the way you grip does set up
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.380]   what attacks you can do as well.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.660]   So that is a huge part.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.740]   And I'm not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.460]   and always outgrip your opponent
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.140]   and only be able to do throws
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.180]   when you have a superior grip.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.380]   I'm just saying that to be able to put the grips together
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.140]   with the throws and understand the movements
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.020]   is going to make you that much ahead of the game.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.440]   - So if we take a step to our previous discussion
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.800]   of going from zero to hero.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   So going from the early days through the teenage years
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.520]   to winning an Olympic medal.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.880]   So we mentioned a lot of training,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   the dedication of the training, the competing.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.120]   What other elements are there?
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.920]   The mental side is visualization,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.640]   believing that you could perform at that level.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.480]   So what else can you say about that?
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   - I think that comes at the highest level.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.280]   The visualization, the success,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.480]   that comes at the highest level.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.600]   I think in the teen years,
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.880]   there's the experience just plays a huge role
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.240]   in getting to train with other people.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.940]   Like as Americans, we have to go train in Europe.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.200]   We have to feel the European style of judo.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.740]   We have to understand that physicality.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.040]   They grip very differently.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.120]   They put you in very unorthodox positions.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.760]   And if you don't know how to deal with that,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.440]   you get thrown before you even have a chance
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.200]   to try your own throws.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.480]   So it takes a lot of that experience
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.760]   and understanding what's going on.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.120]   And then you also need to get that physicality.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.240]   You need to be strong and hard, I would say,
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.640]   by doing all those rounds with the Europeans.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.520]   And at the same time, you need to go to Asia
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.240]   and you need to train in Japan
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.720]   because you need to feel that free flowing judo
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   for your technical, the technical side.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.560]   And I think that's one of the things
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.840]   that I was able to benefit from.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.040]   My dad was a coach who said,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.880]   "Listen, I've taken you as far as I can take you.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.680]   I want you to go to the next level."
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.000]   I want, and he sent me to England with Neil Adams,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.560]   who was an Olympic silver medalist
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.040]   and was a world champion, had a great ground game
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.480]   and was good at gripping and actually did tai otoshi,
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.440]   which is the throw I did.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.480]   So my dad said, "Why don't you go learn from Neil?"
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.760]   And I ended up going to England
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.620]   probably eight to 10 times in my career
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.240]   and spending a good amount of time there
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.680]   training at the Neil Adams Academy.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.000]   He's now the voice of judo, Neil Adams.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:43.920]   - What do you make of that guy?
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.880]   Just a brief pause.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.480]   He's like the, like Morgan Freeman is the voice
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.160]   of like "March of the Penguins"
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.200]   and any other nature documentary.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.840]   And Neil Adams is, there's very few sports
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.360]   that have a Neil Adams, I would say,
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.880]   because he's legitimately, maybe like Joe Rogan
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.800]   is that from mixed martial arts.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.320]   It's just like an exceptionally recognizable voice.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.960]   He's really knowledgeable.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.520]   Also the passion is conveyed so well.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.560]   Like many times I'll watch just because he's talking.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.920]   So who is he, since you've gotten the chance
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.760]   to train with him, to learn from him, who's Neil Adams?
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.240]   - He's a great friend of mine.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.080]   - He is?
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:21.900]   - He's a mentor.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.960]   Like I said, I lived and trained
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.680]   at the Neil Adams Club in Coventry, England
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.880]   since I was like 16 years old.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   I went and visited him for the first time.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.680]   He's the one who originally taught me how to do jujitsu
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.320]   and the way that I do jujitsu.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.140]   I trained with him.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.480]   He was just retired.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.800]   He was in his early 30s when I first went out there.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.920]   And so I trained with him many times.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   And over the years, he was a mentor, great person.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.380]   Cares about people, cares about the sport of judo.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.920]   Had a good little club that was a fitness club.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.680]   It was judo, it was fitness.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.960]   Used to go there.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.280]   I'd show up at that place at like seven in the morning.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   And the first thing we would do is we'd go for a run.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.320]   And we'd either be running mountains
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.280]   or we'd be doing a five mile run
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.120]   or we'd be doing something at the park
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.760]   where we're doing sprints and buddy carries
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.600]   and all this stuff.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.200]   And then at 9 a.m. we'd have a technical session
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.000]   with Neil Adams where he would, for an hour and a half,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.320]   we would drill techniques and learn positions.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.020]   And it was no randori.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.600]   It was that sequential drilling
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.080]   that we talked about before, right?
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.840]   Where you're reinforcing your two or three attacks
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.000]   to set up your main attack.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.200]   Or if you're on the ground,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.900]   you're going through repetitions of certain movements.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.880]   And then I'd spend all afternoon at the club, have lunch.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.280]   I'd go do my weight training in the afternoon at that place.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.240]   And then in the evening,
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.400]   we would either do randori training at the Neil Adams club
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.640]   or we would all get in a car
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.800]   and we'd drive to another location
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.140]   and we'd go train at another club
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.240]   that might be an hour away.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.320]   And there'd be 50 bodies there to train with.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.440]   And each night we'd go to a different dojo.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.380]   And so it would be all day at the club.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.680]   And I'd do that for like three weeks straight.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.800]   All we'd do was train.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.160]   - Do you know how he became the voice of judo?
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.720]   Do you have an understanding of what his thinking is
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   around like how much he dedicates himself
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.920]   to just commentating on judo?
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.280]   I imagine the amount of research required,
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.020]   but also just like psychologically,
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.920]   just the excitement he has in his voice.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.020]   It takes work to do that.
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:28.920]   Do you have an understanding
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.960]   of like what his vision is with that?
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.080]   - He's always been a very charismatic, animated person, Neil.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.400]   Very passionate and loud and funny.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.080]   And the Brits are very funny to begin with.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.880]   So he's very charismatic.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.600]   But I think after coaching, he tried coaching.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.960]   He coached the country of Wales for a while.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.120]   He tried coaching stints in other countries.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.800]   He didn't have a lot of success on the coaching side
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.320]   developing an Olympic champion.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.200]   I know that was a goal of his that he was a world champion.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.520]   I think it was 1981.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.600]   He won two silver medals in the Olympic games himself.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.920]   He went on to coach for a while
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.800]   and had some political issues
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.680]   with the country of England for a while.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.440]   And then left England and went to Wales.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.520]   And I think he had a coaching stint somewhere else as well.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.400]   Didn't have a lot of success coaching in the sport
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.120]   with athletes, not at the highest level.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.280]   Had a great national team and things like that.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.400]   And he was really good at teaching his technique to others
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.020]   'cause he helped me a lot.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.320]   But running a program, I think, was difficult for him.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.920]   The boy's not listening and not having
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.800]   that same kind of passion and intensity that he.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   And that's why I bonded well with him
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.080]   because I was all in.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.160]   I went there and whatever he said, I did.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.640]   I didn't care how hard, I didn't care how long.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.160]   I just wanted to get as good as I could.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.240]   And so that's why he was a good mentor for me.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.680]   But now in terms of a commentator, he's very cerebral.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   He just, he loves judo.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.340]   He researches it nonstop.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.680]   He's got that great voice and he knows how to bring life
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.360]   to the game and that's what he's done.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.000]   And now this is who he is, right?
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.720]   He does judo full-time.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.040]   This is his job.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.440]   - Can I ask you a small, before we return
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.200]   to the actual sport, the coaching of the sport.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.860]   It's a bit of a political question.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.080]   I did a whole rant before Travis episode.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:26.200]   I love Neil Adams' voice.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.000]   I love watching judo.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   And it's really disappointing to me that the IOC
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.680]   and whoever's responsible, I don't understand this,
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.880]   that they don't make it easy for people to watch
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.080]   the Olympics in replay for years after.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.360]   Like I can't watch Travis's matches.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.000]   I can't watch, like they make it very difficult
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.500]   to watch stuff online.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:55.880]   So what happened is I uploaded the Travis Stevens episode
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.200]   and we talked about his Ole Bischoff 2012 match.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.080]   And it was like one minute of like a small overlay
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.480]   of the videos, we're talking through it,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.100]   we're like stepping through it.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.800]   And it got taken down immediately from YouTube,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.320]   the whole four hour conversation
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.580]   because of that one minute little clip.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.660]   And the way it got taken down automatically
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.000]   is because the IOC has that video uploaded.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.400]   It's set to private, but it's uploaded.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.160]   So like they have the video and they choose not to show it.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.320]   It's not that they're asking for money or whatever,
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.400]   they're just not showing it anywhere.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.600]   They're not showing it through their own service
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.760]   like NBC Olympics or so on.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.180]   There's just so many great human stories
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.160]   that the Olympics reveals.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.800]   They're just not made easily accessible.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.480]   That's the Olympics charter is you want to,
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.880]   I think the actual line is to ensure the fullest coverage
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.320]   and the widest possible audience in the world
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.960]   for the Olympic Games.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.480]   And it seems like to me as a fan of the Olympic Games,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.200]   we're not getting any of that.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.080]   Do you have an understanding of why that is?
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.680]   Like why we can't watch Kayla's matches,
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.560]   Travis's matches super easily,
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.960]   even if we're willing to pay money for it.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.800]   - So you can't go on the International Judo Federation
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.560]   website right now and watch any of the Olympic footage?
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.680]   - No, no, no.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.040]   So the only thing they have is for certain,
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.080]   for example, Teddy Rene match he lost.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.200]   Not available anywhere.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.040]   - Really?
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.640]   - And that's like a dramatic thing.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.840]   So the one thing they have is for certain sports
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.220]   at the highest level like gymnastics,
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.600]   they'll have a highlight,
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.680]   which is the most frustrating thing to me.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.160]   Because this is what I can't,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   I'm going to try to prevent myself from going on a rant.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   But people don't just want to see a two minute highlight
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.620]   of a historic moment.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.440]   They want to see the buildup where the athlete is standing,
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.140]   the nerves, the fear, the confidence.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.100]   You see the buildup to the event,
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.220]   say it's a gymnastic, whatever floor routine.
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.840]   Like their name is announced, they're walking,
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.900]   the coat, then they cut to the coach
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.660]   and the coach with anticipation,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:16.820]   and then go to the athlete.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.780]   You want the full 10 minute thing.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.820]   You don't want a two minute highlight
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.380]   of what happened like last second or whatever.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:28.260]   It's just like the magic of that full story,
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.660]   like a lifetime building up to those 10 minutes.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.380]   That's the magic of the Olympics.
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.140]   The both the drama and the triumph
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.540]   that happens in those moments.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.680]   And the fact that you can't relive that.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.460]   Like Travis had a bunch of those.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.940]   He had a bunch of times he faced like world champions.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.940]   He won and lost and just, it's always close.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.140]   It's always dramatic.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.980]   - Right, right, right.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.540]   - And none of those are available
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:58.540]   except like maybe the one where he beat Armbard
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.900]   or whatever the submission was, I forgot.
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:02.740]   - The Georgian.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.980]   - The choke, yeah, the Georgian.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.540]   But most things are not.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.940]   Usain Bolt, the full races,
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.240]   not all of his races are available online.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.440]   The race with the Italian winning
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.660]   the a hundred meter track race.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.420]   This Olympics is not only highlight is available
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.460]   from what I saw, I didn't look too hard.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.540]   So like, but that the fact that it's not super easily
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.780]   accessible if you're willing to pay money even
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:33.060]   but probably should be for free is heartbreaking to me.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:38.060]   'Cause to me, the Olympics is like some of the best
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.300]   of humanity, just like, again, the hardship
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.260]   they have to overcome.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.060]   So like the losses are really powerful.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:45.900]   - Sure.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:46.760]   - 'Cause it's such hard break,
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.380]   but it's also like the triumph.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.420]   - Where you're losing history.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.260]   - Yeah.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.080]   - You're losing history is what you are
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.500]   of all the magical moments of your sport, right?
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.340]   It's a sin.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:03.580]   I gotta blame it on television rights and money.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.780]   That's what it comes down to.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.460]   It's like I'm billions and billions of dollars
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:10.260]   of television rights paid by NBC here in the United States
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.020]   and globally, whatever the main carriers are
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.100]   and all the other nations that are dictating
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.980]   what can be replayed and what can't.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.380]   And it's what it comes down to.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:24.380]   You know, I made a DVD or a video when I first retired
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:27.380]   from the sport, it was called "Fury on the Mat."
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.780]   It was kind of my story, right?
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.420]   And I did it with a friend who was a videographer
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.700]   and we grabbed a bunch of my old footage
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   and Olympic footage.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.940]   And somebody said to me, you can't use that Olympic footage.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.820]   And I was young and I had just retired.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.300]   I said, what do you mean I can't use the Olympic footage?
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.340]   It's not the television footage.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:47.500]   It's my buddy who filmed it with his own camera.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.340]   It's my footage.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.260]   You know, and they said, no, if it has Olympics in it
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.960]   or it's anything to do with the Olympics,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.620]   the USOC owns it.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.460]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.280]   I said, okay, well, they said,
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.660]   well, you should get to send it to them
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.300]   and let them review it.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.660]   So I sent it to them and I got a bill back.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.940]   I got a thing back that said,
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.860]   if you wanna use this footage, it's gonna be like $30,000.
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.180]   And I said, man, it's only like three minutes.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.140]   I spliced it up as much as I could
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.220]   and I only have highlights in there.
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.060]   And then I said, come on.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.360]   I went back and I negotiated with them.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.420]   But at the end of the day, I still had to pay like $15,000
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.780]   just to have a few minutes of footage in my own film.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.340]   (laughing)
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.020]   And I'm thinking, you wouldn't even have that film
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.100]   if I didn't compete in it.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.180]   You know, like you can't, you know.
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.940]   So it was a struggle.
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.780]   - This is the different, like you have the same in jujitsu.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.780]   There's certain organizations, IBJJF,
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.020]   or like flow grappling and flow wrestling.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:43.060]   I understand, I think when it's a business,
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.620]   it might make sense.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.240]   First of all, you should actually be good
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.180]   at being a business and making money,
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.100]   which is why for me, the IOC doesn't make sense.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.340]   Like it should be accessible, but it would cost money.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.580]   I can't buy it.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.220]   Like would I have to email them for this footage
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.060]   and pay $30,000?
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:06.220]   No, but the question is like the way you run a business
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   is you make that frictionless.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.060]   Whatever the money is, $30,000 or $30,
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.860]   you make it frictionless and easy to pay that money.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:17.020]   But anyway, I understand why that might be the case
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.940]   with flow grappling, but to me,
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.020]   the Olympics is a special thing.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.860]   - For sure.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.880]   - It's like you said, it is history.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.180]   Like there's not even,
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.940]   like even the world championships don't compare.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.180]   I understand they're really important,
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.100]   but Olympics is history.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:37.100]   And the stories should certainly belong to the athletes
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.820]   if they want to do like "Fury on the Mat"
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.060]   to do their own story or like on a podcast
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.240]   to talk about the most tragic moment of their career.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:53.060]   Do you have a sense of how that could be fixed or no?
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.620]   - The only thing I could think of is,
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.340]   you'd have to go to the Olympic Committee.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.780]   The US Olympic Committee is the place I would start
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.940]   'cause the US controls the worldwide market
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.580]   when it comes to television.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.280]   We pay the most for our television rights.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.860]   Our sponsors pay the most for their rights
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.020]   to be associated with the best team in the world,
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.220]   which is the United States, right?
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.260]   So it's where all the money starts here.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:18.900]   I got to believe there has to be a way to get that footage
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:22.420]   that should be accessible to the sports themselves.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.740]   I'm surprised it's not, but if it's not,
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.540]   then it's because of dollars.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.580]   It's because people aren't,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.420]   the sport itself is not willing to pay enough money
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.700]   to have it on its, accessible to its audience.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.660]   It's too cost prohibitive for them to do it.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.740]   - No, but I think it's also, unfortunately,
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.060]   might be some mixture of incompetence
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.160]   and just an old way of doing things
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.380]   because there's a lot of money to be made
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.900]   on television rights where you live show the event, right?
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.620]   But what's not being leveraged is the huge amount of money
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.060]   that could be made on the replay.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.820]   This is what people don't understand is,
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.940]   do you know how many times, just the tens of millions,
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.020]   of times that people watch individual events
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.380]   years from now.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.660]   You watch like all the videos on YouTube,
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:14.220]   they're still getting plays,
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.700]   hundreds of millions of views on stuff that happened
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.620]   10 years ago, 15 years ago.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.940]   That's really powerful.
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.340]   And there's a lot of opportunity to make a ton of money.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:25.500]   So it's not that they're necessarily greedy.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.020]   They're also just not good at being greedy.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.060]   - Oh, I get what you're saying, yeah.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:30.980]   It's not the tradition, you know, think about it though.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.220]   It's not traditional, right?
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.780]   For television studios, it's non-traditional
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.300]   to go to online streaming, to online access to information.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.260]   It's not hard, right?
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.100]   'Cause everybody's doing it now, but it's not typical.
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.420]   - Yeah.
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:50.060]   So it requires for the IOC to operate
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.380]   outside their comfort zone.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.300]   Well, I definitely hope that's the case.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:58.300]   And since Travis's video got taken down,
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.460]   it's obvious they have it.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.500]   They have it on their YouTube channel.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.500]   So it's like, I hope, I hope that they will just release it
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.580]   and for money, for whatever, but release it
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.580]   and have that history not be erased, right?
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.100]   - It'd be wonderful if athletes could buy,
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.340]   even if you could buy your own footage,
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.060]   you can't use it commercially, you can't,
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.160]   but you can buy your own matches
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.820]   and have them available for yourself
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.440]   or package the footage, it'd be awesome.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   (sighs)
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.440]   - Thank you for that.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.240]   It is quite heartbreaking for me.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.460]   So I wanted to talk about it a little bit.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:41.440]   Let's go to you as an athlete real quick.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.260]   - Sure.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.720]   - You represented the United States at four Olympics,
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.040]   winning a bronze medal at two of them.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.740]   Who or what was the toughest match
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.220]   or moment you had in those years?
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.560]   Maybe a moment that defined you,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.920]   that you remember as being particularly
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.400]   defining in your career.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:11.320]   - I would say the bronze medal match in Atlanta in '96,
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.080]   because up to that moment,
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.680]   the United States team had not won a medal,
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.560]   had not fought for a medal in the games.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.240]   We were on our home turf.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   It was my second Olympic games, right?
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.040]   So I had competed in '92 and I had won two matches
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.520]   and lost in the third round in Barcelona.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.640]   I didn't make the podium.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.660]   I lost to a Japanese guy from Japan.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.000]   But the gold, silver, and bronze medalist
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.480]   at that Olympics in Barcelona were all guys that I had beat.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.640]   In fact, two of them I was undefeated against
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.520]   in my entire career, the Brazilian and the Cuban,
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.160]   I had never lost to.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.520]   So that's when I knew I was capable of being
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.400]   on the podium at the Olympic games.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.640]   When '96 came around, I was 25 years old.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.200]   I was fairly in my prime.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.860]   I had lived in Japan for six months.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.720]   My technique was at a high level.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.140]   I was amongst the best in the world.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:07.840]   I lost at that Olympics to a guy from Mongolia.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.720]   It was right before the match I was supposed
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.760]   to fight against Japan.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.320]   So I was anticipating the match against Japan
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.680]   and I got beat by the Mongolian.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.900]   So that was kind of a letdown.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.100]   But the match for the bronze,
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.920]   in front of the hometown crowd,
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.320]   all of my family, all of my friends,
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.820]   everybody who had ever helped me in the sport
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.340]   were in the stands that day,
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.720]   including all my teammates at Brown University
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.940]   that were on the wrestling team,
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.980]   and little, my uncles, my aunts, everybody.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.660]   Everybody was in the stands, right?
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.920]   So it was like the Jimmy Pedro day.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.620]   And I'm getting goosebumps right now talking about it.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.280]   But it was a match against the Brazilian
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.200]   for the bronze medal.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.240]   I had beaten the Brazilian like two or three times
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.080]   before that.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.060]   I found myself down in the match.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.340]   He actually countered me.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.340]   I came in my taotoshi and he was waiting for it
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.820]   and he countered me and he scored a yuko against me.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.640]   So I was losing the fight,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.260]   came down to about the last minute in the match,
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.340]   and I was just tucking in my gi and fixing my thing
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.920]   and gathering my thoughts together.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.620]   And the whole crowd just started chanting,
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.340]   "USA, USA, USA."
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.620]   And I literally got so much energy.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.740]   I walked out there, I grabbed the guy,
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.280]   I came in my taotoshi again.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.140]   He stepped off the taotoshi.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.580]   I threw him with duchimata, free pwn.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.580]   I won my first Olympic medal in front of the hometown crowd.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.860]   Everybody went bananas.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.580]   The United States judo team had our first medal
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.820]   from the Olympics.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.100]   It ended up being the only Olympic medal we won
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.240]   at that Games, but it was like a magical moment
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.740]   that defined my career and solidified myself
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.140]   in history where, hey, now I get to step up
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.780]   on the Olympic podium and I'm Olympic medalist.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.660]   And to me, that was my defining moment.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.840]   And after that, I was sold.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.860]   Like, man, I had to go back to the Olympics again.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:58.940]   I want to win a gold medal.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.680]   I want to do, I want this feeling all over again.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.560]   I don't care if I have to wait four years.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.040]   Let's do it.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.480]   - In your career, like moments like that,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   do you think you love winning or hate losing more?
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.820]   So do you live for those moments
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.820]   or are you more driven by just how much you hate losing?
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.340]   - So in order to be a champion,
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.420]   my belief is that you have to hate losing
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.300]   more than you like winning.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.620]   Hate losing more than you like winning.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.840]   But I live for those moments when you do win.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.540]   And what excited me the most in my career
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:44.300]   when I was competing was I loved being in the finals.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.460]   I loved the spotlight being on me.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.900]   I can't think of too many times in my career,
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.360]   of course there were a few,
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.120]   but there weren't too many times where the chips were down,
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.820]   like the lights were on and I didn't win.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.020]   Like it was, I might've lost early in the day
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.300]   and didn't make it to the finals
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.860]   or didn't make it to the medal rounds.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.300]   But like in my career, I have a ton of golds.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:10.540]   I have a ton of bronzes, which means the lights are on
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:14.980]   and I won and I have very few silvers and very few fifths.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.620]   So I either lost in the early rounds
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.560]   and didn't make to the medal rounds in my younger days,
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.660]   or the spotlight came and I really shined.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.540]   'Cause if you look, I don't know how many silvers,
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.060]   but there wasn't very many silver medals
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.580]   in my career that I won.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.400]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.980]   So I just loved that moment.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.260]   I didn't feel pressure.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.740]   I loved the crowd.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.380]   I loved being in the spotlight.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.180]   I didn't have, I wasn't nervous when it came to the finals
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.940]   or I knew I was getting a medal, it didn't matter.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.740]   You know, so it was just me against the other guy
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.340]   and that's how I always saw it.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.220]   And I just loved that moment.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.860]   - So your dad was your coach.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.120]   (laughing)
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.140]   - You didn't get to meet him tonight.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:50.980]   - Oh, great.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.220]   (laughing)
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.060]   He's kind of a legend in the sport.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:00.300]   So how has your dad helped you as a coach, as an athlete,
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.340]   as a human being throughout the years?
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:07.620]   - Number one, my dad is the most brutally honest person
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.540]   you will ever meet in your life, brutally honest.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.580]   He will tell you, if you are fat,
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.580]   he will tell you you're fat right to your face.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.780]   He wants you to get better.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:18.140]   He wants you to be healthy.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.900]   Doesn't want you to die of obesity.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.260]   It's just the way he is.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.860]   If you didn't do well, he will not sugarcoat it.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.260]   He will let you know what you didn't do right.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.220]   So he's the ultimate litmus test.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:36.100]   Second is he is the most passionate, caring, deep,
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:41.020]   like always thinking about, very cerebral,
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.740]   very like a student of the game.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:49.260]   Somebody who helped me immensely in defining my strategy,
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:53.540]   helping me improve and always look for what's next.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:07:00.380]   In terms of training, I think that he's probably
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.740]   the most brilliant human when it comes
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.580]   to preparing an athlete physically,
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.080]   not necessarily mentally, physically for success.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.460]   When all the chips are down,
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.900]   that athlete will be ready that day.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.860]   And he has a system of training and preparing
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.860]   and getting the athlete to peak for performance.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.900]   - You mean like conditioning, like the whole thing?
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.940]   - Yes.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.300]   - Okay, 'cause I remember like, vaguely remember
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.500]   Kayla Harrison talking about her preparation
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.020]   being very difficult.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.220]   - Yeah, that's it.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.060]   - That's him?
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:34.900]   - Yeah, that's him.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:35.740]   (laughing)
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.420]   At the same, you go back and ask Ronda Rousey
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.460]   about her career, right?
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.320]   My dad was her coach.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.880]   My dad moved her to Camp New Hampshire in Boston,
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.160]   got her up, ran her in the morning,
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.700]   had her downstairs in the basement of his house,
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.680]   training with the weights.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.960]   We brought a Russian girl in.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.980]   She did throws on his cement outside
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.420]   with the little crash pad.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.300]   Threw the Russian girl, 100 times that morning.
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.000]   And then every night came to Boston,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.040]   to the training center in Wakefield, trained at night,
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.660]   went back and slept at my dad's house
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:09.300]   and three weeks straight before she went off to Beijing.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.100]   And he did the same with Kayla.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.380]   He did the same with me.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:16.580]   He's just, his passion is producing athletes
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.780]   at the highest level and he knows how to do it.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.780]   And then the one side of my dad's coaching
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.220]   where I think there's a flaw or weakness
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.320]   is on the mental preparation side of the game.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.480]   He wasn't somebody that was, I don't know if he,
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.940]   maybe because he wasn't an Olympic champion himself
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.960]   and wasn't a world champion, he lacked the confidence
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.820]   in helping others be more confident.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.460]   So he's more of a, this is what you need
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.580]   to work on type of thing.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.240]   He doesn't know how to build the athletes up
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.260]   to make them feel invincible.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.020]   And I feel like that's something that I was able
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.260]   to give all of the athletes,
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.060]   to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself,
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.140]   knowing that you're going to win
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.260]   before you step out on the mat,
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.020]   knowing that we've earned the right to victory,
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.600]   seeing success in your mind, having a positive mantra
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.300]   that you, I'm the best in the world,
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.080]   nobody's beaten me today type of feeling.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.980]   So you go out there feeling like King Kong
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.380]   when you step on the mat, nobody's going to stop you.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.960]   And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches,
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.280]   I'm a lot more technical.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.900]   My dad is good at letting, identifying what they need to do
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:26.960]   for their techniques and what, how to, and strategy,
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.780]   how to beat opponents and putting game plans together.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.760]   So combined, the two of us made an unbelievable team.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.400]   - So he's not going to let the athlete be soft
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.360]   when they enter the highest,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.600]   the most difficult competitions of their career.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.100]   So on the mental side, what's mental preparation look like?
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.840]   Like how many years before the Olympics
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.080]   do you start helping an athlete believe
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.440]   that they can win an Olympic medal?
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.000]   - Well, I think it's got to be a seed
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.280]   in that athlete's brain, something they want to do, right?
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.720]   Nobody can quickly get there, right?
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.840]   It's a long process, but if your goal,
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.200]   if you're a national champion,
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.920]   or you've proven yourself to win
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.240]   in some international tournaments,
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.440]   and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.160]   then defining it as, hey, I want to be on the Olympic team,
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.160]   that would be the first step into getting ready.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.400]   And I always make them put it on paper.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.600]   If it really is your goal,
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.880]   then you show me that it's your goal
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.960]   and put it on paper and commit to it.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.080]   I want to be Olympic medalist,
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080]   I want to be Olympic champion,
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.560]   I want to go to the Olympics.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.920]   World team member, maybe junior world team member,
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.720]   whatever it is, we walk before we go to the highest level.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.360]   But if the goal is to go to the Olympics,
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.880]   let's accomplish these other things first, right?
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.280]   Because if we can accomplish these other things,
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.600]   then we're on our way to getting to the ultimate goal,
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.160]   which is the Olympics.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.340]   For somebody like Kayla, for example,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.240]   she didn't say that she wanted to be Olympic champion
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.360]   when she first came here in 2005, right?
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.840]   We wanted to become national champion,
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.320]   then we wanted to be on the world team,
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.040]   then we wanted to be a world medalist.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.920]   Then our sights were set on the Olympics
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.600]   or the Olympic gold.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.160]   So it's having those clearly defined goals
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.160]   that are attainable.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.000]   Like they should be a reach, they should be a stretch,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.800]   but they have to be attainable.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.400]   They can't be just a pipe dream.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.160]   But once you put it to paper,
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.120]   and you think it's achievable,
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.080]   then it's mapping the plan to get there.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.920]   - Is there a daily process of visualizing yourself
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.080]   as an Olympic champion or national champion?
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.920]   - Yes, it is.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.240]   You should do it either every night before you go to bed
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.720]   or before every training session
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.200]   or after every training session.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.720]   One of those three times it should,
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.120]   or first thing you wake up in the morning.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.640]   Because it may be to help some people,
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.760]   it motivates them to go do what it is
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.460]   they're supposed to do in the day.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.660]   But the process of visualization is to me,
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.600]   is closing your eyes for a few moments.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.880]   Your brain works really, really fast.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.600]   And it's actually picturing the day in its entirety
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.120]   from start to finish.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.280]   From the moment you wake up and you step on the scale
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.560]   to the moment you have your breakfast
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.320]   and you go through your morning routine.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.000]   Like live the day that you're gonna have at the Olympics.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.200]   So whatever it is you're trying to do,
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.200]   let's say the Olympic day, for example.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.040]   Picture yourself making weight,
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.920]   picture yourself who you're around, eating your breakfast,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.960]   having maybe saying a few jokes, laughing.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.120]   This is a real day, make it real.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.880]   Going back and packing your judo bag for the day,
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.960]   getting on the bus, driving to the venue,
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.560]   feel what it's like walking into the stadium
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.200]   for the first time, going to the warmup area,
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.720]   seeing your drawer up on the sheet
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.800]   who you're gonna fight that day.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.840]   Watching yourself warm up, go through your warmup routine.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.640]   Walking out of the chute, into the venue,
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.500]   going to do that first fight.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.560]   Picture the moment of throwing your opponent,
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.840]   coming off the mat, high-fiving the coach,
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.560]   getting ready for your second fight.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.520]   Like live the day from start to finish
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.480]   and make it as real as possible.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.000]   All the way to the moment where you've just won
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.520]   and you're raising your arms in celebration,
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.000]   you're bowing, you're hugging your opponent,
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.840]   you come off the mat, you hug your coach,
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.840]   you're running around the stadium with the flag,
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   you stepped up on the podium, you heard your name,
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.500]   Olympic champion, Jimmy Pedro, like you heard the moment.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.040]   The medal being put around your neck,
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.080]   picture the people coming up on the podium with you,
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.280]   arms around them, taking the pictures.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.040]   The more real you can make it,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.780]   even before it ever happens, right?
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.920]   When you do that enough times,
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.760]   I feel that like pathways get created for you
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.040]   so that when your body gets to that moment,
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.680]   and I've been here before, this is it, this is my moment,
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.040]   this is what I've pictured my whole life.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.240]   I'm not nervous 'cause I've seen this,
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.020]   this is gonna happen, I believe it's possible, right?
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.020]   And I believe the athletes that do that
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.720]   and make it real enough that when they get to that moment,
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.240]   they go right through, there's no hesitation.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.440]   This is meant to be, this is my destiny,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.640]   this is why I did everything I did,
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.080]   versus the ones that don't think about it ever,
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.120]   but just kind of like hope, it's not real to them,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.840]   it doesn't feel attainable, they don't believe it's possible
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.040]   they haven't committed to believing it was possible.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.900]   Without that commitment in yourself and that belief,
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.120]   it can't happen.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.600]   - And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this,
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.280]   you probably worked with him on the details
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.840]   of what you're talking about,
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.840]   but he said that you should really focus on visualizing
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.360]   the sensations you feel.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.760]   So say if you're drinking coffee or something like that,
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.040]   you're not thinking about observing yourself
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.000]   from a third person perspective drinking coffee,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.560]   you're thinking of how your hand will feel
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.440]   when it touches something warm.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.160]   Do you try to replay the actual sensations
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.040]   you would feel?
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.840]   It sounds kind of strange, but meaning like
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.960]   you really wanna put yourself in the body
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.580]   as you would experience those moments,
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.280]   as opposed to watching yourself on TV,
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.240]   experiencing those moments, really be inside.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.520]   So that means sensations,
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.440]   how does it feel when you grip a gi,
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.880]   sweating, just the sensation of sweat
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.320]   rolling down your forehead or whatever,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.640]   all of those actual feelings.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.600]   - When I explain it to you,
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.800]   I guess my body has been through it so many times,
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.480]   both in my mind and in reality,
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.280]   that it brings back all of those same emotions.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:07.040]   I start to get goose bumps, my armpits start to sweat.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.360]   I'm living it if it's real.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.680]   I'm reliving it now,
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.400]   but when you're going through the visualization process,
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.680]   it has to be that real.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.520]   The smells, the taping of the fingers,
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.400]   the more colorful and the more real you can make it,
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.840]   the more believable it is.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.880]   - So I've been doing this kind of thing,
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.720]   just having listened to you enough
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.040]   for other stuff in life.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.440]   And so let's see if it works.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.280]   But do you see this kind of visualization
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.200]   being useful for other things in career
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.040]   and all those kinds of things?
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.560]   - Oh, 100%, 100%.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.360]   Because I just know with my own life, my own experiences,
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.000]   like my wife sometimes says to me,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.600]   she says, "Well, where do you see yourself
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.560]   in like five years from now?"
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.880]   And five years ago, I had said to her,
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.600]   "I want to have my own business.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.800]   I want to have, this is the amount of money
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.640]   that I'm hoping I can make in a given year."
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.000]   Like you have to have goals for yourself.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.920]   Like is this, if you put out there like,
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.040]   "Okay, I want to make a million dollars in a year."
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.200]   That's a big number.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.480]   Like for me or for the normal person,
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.960]   like that's a really big number.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.800]   You know what I mean?
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.760]   Like it's not, especially when you're not making
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.840]   that much at the time, it's a super big number, right?
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.480]   So having those goals for yourself,
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.800]   like it won't happen and it's not possible
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.920]   unless you dream it's possible and think that it's possible.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.160]   And then it doesn't magically happen.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.020]   And maybe it doesn't happen in five years,
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.320]   maybe happens in 10.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.960]   But at least you're on the path to getting there.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.800]   You know what I mean?
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.000]   And I said, "I want to own my own business.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.440]   I want to control my own destiny.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.200]   I want to be my own boss.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.960]   I want to make my own decisions."
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.120]   Like these are the things that I told her I wanted to do.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.240]   And now I'm at that point, you know, where, you know,
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.400]   I work for myself, I have my own company,
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.680]   I have partners obviously, but like,
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.560]   if I want to pick up and go somewhere for a week,
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.800]   I just do, I don't have to ask permission to do it.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.160]   Right, that's what life, freedom, right?
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.880]   That's what I'd like.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.200]   - And all of it starts with a dream.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.040]   - In the same with my dojo.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.880]   When I first opened, so I ran a dojo for a long time
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.640]   and I only had 60 students always,
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.960]   like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.800]   And I said to myself,
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.960]   "Why can't I get more people on my door?"
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.280]   Right, so I hired consultants to come in
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.920]   and look at my business and say, "Why?"
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.500]   Right, and they came in and said,
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.400]   "Well, this place is really intimidating."
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.060]   Like if I was coming in off the street,
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.280]   the first thing I see is this big Olympic champion
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.760]   on the wall and I see this training that's going on
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.080]   and these guys are flying through the air and landing hard.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.680]   And as a white belt, you're telling me
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.760]   that's the class for me?
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.480]   Like, no way, I'm not gonna do that.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.080]   So like I listened to these people and I said,
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.560]   "You're right."
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.060]   And the training was hour and a half, two hours long.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.200]   People can't handle an hour and a half or two hours training
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.200]   when they first walk in the door.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.900]   So I had to restructure all my programming.
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.640]   I had to look at the way I was offering my curriculum
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.800]   at my school and I had to make levels for everybody, right?
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.520]   Like here's my four to six year old class.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.720]   Here's my six to 13 year old class.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.800]   There's all my beginner classes.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.600]   They don't mix in with the advanced people.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.600]   And I had to learn how to make it accessible for everybody
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.520]   instead of just the people that wanted to train hard.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.160]   And then the challenge was, okay,
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.000]   if you can have a lot of people in your dojo training,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.120]   it's a recreational school.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.280]   You can't produce champions at that same school.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.760]   That's what I was told.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.980]   So then I got all my black belts together and I said,
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.560]   "Listen, this is my vision.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.740]   "This is what I want.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:38.100]   "I wanna have a club that has over 200 judo only athletes.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:41.680]   "No jiu-jitsu, no karate, nothing, judo only.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.800]   "I want over 200 people."
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.680]   And inside of that dojo, I wanna have Olympic champions
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.040]   and I wanna have recreational.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.260]   Like little kids, five and six years old,
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.820]   older guys in their 70s training, I don't care,
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.640]   but I want the spectrum of recreational
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.240]   and I want Olympic champions.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.440]   The only way to do that is to take your instructors
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.160]   and say, "You're gonna do this.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.240]   "Define the roles.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.740]   "Who's gonna be the recreational coach?
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.180]   "Who's gonna be the competitive coach?
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.620]   "How do we separate these programs?"
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.220]   And lo and behold, that was my vision
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.420]   that I shared with all of them.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:15.000]   And that was back in 2006.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.840]   And by 2012, we got Olympic champion Kayla Harrison,
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.960]   we have over 200 people at the school,
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.260]   we have a successful thriving business,
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:28.080]   but it doesn't happen without that vision, a plan,
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.480]   and believing that it's possible.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.520]   - Believing that it's possible.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.780]   I don't know, but I personally have on top of that,
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:41.880]   almost like very specific visions of a future.
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.660]   I don't know what,
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.760]   'cause I don't wanna give actual examples.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.720]   'Cause for several reasons,
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:54.720]   one of which is just people will, as they often have,
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.160]   they often will in your life,
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.440]   they'll just laugh at it a little bit.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.840]   Like that seems silly.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.320]   And I don't, I'm very hesitant to share certain things
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.220]   like that with people because they'll,
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:11.280]   I mean, I'm with Johnny Ive,
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.360]   who's the lead designer in Apple.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.160]   Like you want that dream, that little flame to not,
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.680]   people will put that flame out too easily,
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.540]   even people that love you.
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:24.540]   So I have very specific kind of visions,
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:30.840]   like maybe for Travis, it would be like a specific opponent
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.600]   or something like Ole Bischoff,
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.760]   very specific, very specific situation
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.800]   of what's going to happen.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.200]   Not just like, I wanna be Olympic champion,
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.120]   but very specific, like almost silly situations.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.960]   Yeah, like the dynamic between Travis and Ole Bischoff
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.760]   or something like, maybe visualize that.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.000]   For me, that helps because it makes it all real,
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.360]   even more real.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.440]   It's not like some big goal,
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.840]   like a million dollars or something like that,
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.400]   which is also really important to have
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.160]   because you can measure it and so on.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   But it's just like you belong in those situations.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.920]   Just believing you belong there.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.600]   It's not the default. - It can be you.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.760]   - Yeah, it could be you.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.620]   And that for some reason, that really helps me,
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.720]   the little details. - Sure.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.760]   - The visualizing, most of them are almost
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   a little bit funny.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.280]   Focusing on the funniness,
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.060]   it's the mundane-ness of it helps me a lot.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.240]   And all the people that have done great things,
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.840]   they're just human too.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.060]   - Correct, and I think a lot of people overestimate
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.640]   who others are, right?
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.280]   And sell themselves too short.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.580]   Because at the end of the day,
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:47.440]   everybody started like everybody else, really.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.360]   I mean, we did.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.660]   We're all infants, we couldn't walk, we couldn't talk,
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.400]   we couldn't do anything, we learned along the way.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.240]   But, and I think that's the one thing that I realized
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.140]   is that, and I tell this to my athletes,
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:03.380]   but I also tell it to my recreational students.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:07.020]   Nobody is better than you are, nobody.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:09.580]   Unless you allow them to be, right?
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.620]   If you really want something to happen,
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:16.460]   then like map the plan, believe in yourself,
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:20.740]   decide, and know, full out, you're gonna fail a lot.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.660]   You're gonna get beat down, you're gonna have losses,
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.580]   you're gonna have struggles.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.280]   And I think that's the one thing with social media today
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.640]   is that everybody sees everybody succeed.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.320]   Nobody posts a picture when they're on the ground
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.760]   and fail, you lose 'em.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.160]   Like nobody sees when you broke your arm
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.500]   and you had to go through rehab, whatever it is,
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.500]   like had your injuries and you're on your couch watching TV
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.220]   and you were suffering and you were,
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.500]   like everybody has really, really dark,
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.060]   bad moments in their life.
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:50.280]   And defeats and losses and suffrage.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.140]   And it's only at the end,
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.000]   after they've recovered from all of that,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.460]   they've reclimbed up the mountain
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.660]   and they've gone to the pinnacle
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.780]   that you see them on social media with the medal, right?
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.140]   But everybody else struggles and was human
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.320]   and failed many, many times.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   And convincing yourself that you're capable,
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.620]   I think is the first start with everything.
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:15.580]   - Do you need people in your life that believe in you
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:19.020]   or should most of it come from within yourself?
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.060]   - I think most of it has to come in from,
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.540]   it certainly helps, but it has to come from you first.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.600]   You have to be driven.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.520]   Like other people can help you define where you wanna go
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.340]   and help you get there and encourage you
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.380]   and can support you and whether it's resource-wise
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.780]   or with connections and like they can help with that path.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   But that first part has to come from you.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.620]   It has to be your passion, your desire,
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.380]   your commitment to yourself.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.700]   You're the one that's gonna ultimately
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.780]   make all the sacrifices to do it.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.500]   So it has to be your decision,
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.880]   not your parents, not your spouse's,
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.140]   something that you're really motivated to do.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.300]   - Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.220]   and maybe a few of the other athletes
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.060]   you've been involved with.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:05.380]   So first, Travis.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:11.560]   Travis Stevens, Olympic silver medalist,
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.820]   three-time Olympian 2008, 2012, 2016.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:20.300]   What makes Travis Stevens great?
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.020]   What makes him so successful?
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.720]   What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete?
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.800]   Through all the hardship he had to overcome,
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.540]   through his weird looking sayonara
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.420]   that eventually worked out nicely,
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:39.020]   through the full richness of his personality,
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:41.100]   in the context of all the other great athletes
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.100]   you've coached, what makes him special?
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.220]   - His fight, Travis has fight.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.660]   And you know, the first time I ever saw Travis Stevens
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.900]   was in, like recognized him,
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.300]   maybe I had seen him before as a younger boy or something,
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.820]   but like actually recognized him is,
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.900]   I brought a group of young kids to Italy
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.100]   for a competition in a training camp.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.180]   And it was this program called U23 Elite.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:10.740]   And I picked, handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:14.200]   And it was the first time I coached an international team.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.020]   And I had never seen Travis fight before,
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.800]   compete, train, anything.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.460]   And during this competition, you know,
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.820]   he's an 81 kilo player.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   I think he was maybe like 18 years old, 17, 18 years old.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.100]   And it was a really hard European event.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.780]   And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.220]   But what stood out the most to me was like
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.180]   the fight he had in him.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.220]   He was scrapping every fight.
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:42.540]   Like he scrapped hard.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.140]   Like he wanted to win more than any of them, right?
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.380]   He didn't win, but he wanted to win more.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.700]   And I noticed that right away.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.620]   And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.400]   and he was eliminated from the tournament,
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.020]   I saw how disappointed he was in himself.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:58.740]   Like he actually thought he was supposed
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.900]   to beat those people, even though he was like 17, right?
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.900]   And he's fighting against grown men that are, you know,
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.340]   a high level judo, much higher than he was.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.740]   And I said to him, I said, "Hey son, like, don't worry, man.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.220]   You got a long career ahead of you.
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.600]   Like, I'm glad you're disappointed,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.700]   but there's so many things you don't know
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.660]   and so many skills you don't have.
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.500]   The fact that you were able to hold your own
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.860]   and scrap like that, like you've got a good future."
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.940]   And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.420]   after that tournament.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:27.300]   And I said, "Hey man,
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.780]   did you ever hear of this kid, Travis Stevens?"
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:30.860]   He says, "No, why?"
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.020]   I said, "Man, that kid's got some fight in him, right?"
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.140]   And I said that.
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.740]   I said that to Jason at the time.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.220]   I said, "That kid's got some fight in him, man.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.640]   He's pretty talented."
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.440]   You know, and that's how it started.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.440]   But so I saw that in him when he was young.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:46.280]   But the other thing was, Travis,
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.360]   like there's no such thing as hard work to that guy.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.400]   If you tell him to put his head through the wall
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.920]   and that's how he wins,
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.200]   he'll go put his head through the wall.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   He'll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve success.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:06.000]   And he hates failure more than he likes winning, 100%.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   He always has.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.120]   He punishes himself when he doesn't do well.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.640]   He makes himself work harder.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.640]   He goes and just abuses himself when he doesn't succeed
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.240]   because he's so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.920]   So that's a trait that I think all of the athletes
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.960]   that I work with closely, they all had that same trait.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.880]   They hated losing more than anything.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.920]   They would break their arm.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.360]   They'd fall on their head.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.960]   You know, they'd rather get hit by a car
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.680]   than lose a judo tournament.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.320]   You know, and as a result, then they all had fight
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.840]   and they all were willing to train.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.160]   They were willing to listen
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.440]   and they would do anything for victory.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.140]   You know, within the rules,
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:47.960]   I'm not talking about taking drugs or anything like that,
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.760]   but they'd give 100% of themselves for victory.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.120]   And, you know, Travis was somebody that when he was down,
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.760]   he found a way to get better doing something else.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.600]   If he couldn't do standing, that's when he started jujitsu.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.160]   He couldn't go on his feet anymore.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.920]   He couldn't stand up and train.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.440]   I might as well go learn jujitsu
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.960]   and get good on the ground, right?
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.320]   Because I can't, you know?
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.520]   So he always found a way,
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.760]   and no matter what obstacle was in his way,
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.320]   he just went around it.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.080]   - So what about the,
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.120]   it'd be interesting to get your perspective,
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.960]   'cause I know Travis's perspective
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:24.200]   is just the number of injuries.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.440]   Like, what do you make of the perseverance
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.800]   through all the injuries he had to overcome?
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.880]   Specifically, like you just observing this creature
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.480]   that you've coached.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.200]   I mean, he seems to not see the injuries as a problem.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.800]   He just like, just like you said, head through the wall.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.840]   It's like, what, like when we were talking about injuries,
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.520]   he kinda, he doesn't even see the injuries themselves
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.920]   as the problem, because he thinks that the injuries,
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.740]   you know, you heal back stronger.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:57.200]   I forget the exact quote, but he said like,
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:02.200]   "My body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else."
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:03.760]   - 'Cause I've already broken everything.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.080]   - I've broken everything,
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.320]   and it's just grown back stronger.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.560]   Like, 'cause I asked him something like,
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.920]   "Do you regret sort of pushing your body
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.120]   "to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?"
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:19.520]   His response was like, "No, I'm stronger now."
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.920]   So I don't know if that's justification,
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.740]   but that certainly describes a mindset that,
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.440]   yeah, head through the wall.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.640]   That doesn't, it's almost not dramatic.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.480]   Like, look, I got this injury.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.240]   It's so, I'm so like brave and special
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.400]   for overcoming this injury.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.880]   He's just, that's part of the job,
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.600]   and he gets the job done.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.400]   But like that job involves a lot of injuries.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.760]   - One of the talks I gave Travis and that team
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.120]   at that particular tournament was,
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.280]   at the very beginning of the camp, after the tournament,
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.440]   I said to them, "Listen, my vision,"
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.600]   I shared my vision with them.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.960]   I said, "My vision is, you know, in seven years,"
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.680]   'cause that was 2005, I said, "In seven years,
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:04.280]   "I want to have a US team that steps on the mat
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.320]   "that is ready to kick ass."
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.960]   And in order to get there,
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.800]   all of you guys can be a part of this team
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.320]   and part of this process, but in order to get there,
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.400]   you guys have to be the first ones to practice.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.900]   You have to be the last ones to leave,
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.740]   'cause we have to work harder than the rest of the world
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.600]   because we're up against all odds.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.680]   I said, "I am sick of America being a laughingstock
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.660]   "of judo and being the first round, easy match,
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.760]   "warmup for everybody else."
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.720]   I said, "If you get injured,
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:34.900]   "you're not gonna be on the side with a ice bag on,
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.240]   "taking off rounds, and then get back on the mat
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.020]   "the next day and tell me you're okay.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:41.320]   "If you can train the next day, you can train today."
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.200]   So there's no injury.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.160]   The only time you're leaving this dojo
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.160]   is if the ambulance has to take you out of here.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.960]   And I do think subliminally,
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.080]   Travis bought into that message and heard that message then,
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.100]   said, "If I'm gonna be a champ,
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.600]   "then that's the way I'm gonna do it."
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.640]   And he did.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.920]   And he embodied it, he lived it.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:01.960]   Man, there were many times in Europe
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.000]   where I'd say, "Dude, just tape it up.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.220]   "I'll go off to the side, just take the day off.
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.560]   "Like take the rest of the day off.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.880]   "You're beat up, you can't do it."
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.400]   He said, "No, no, I'm gonna tape it up, I'm gonna tape it up."
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.440]   I said, "No, you don't need to right now."
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.440]   And he said, "No, sensei, I'm doing it."
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.000]   You know, the ambulance isn't taking me out,
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.440]   it's just my wrist, it's just my ankle, it's just my wrist.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.080]   - It's just my ankle.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.280]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.840]   Yeah, what about the,
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.360]   so the other really big thing is,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.500]   you comment on a little bit, is the weight cut.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.840]   So early in his career, he was 81 kg,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.160]   and that was presumably not so difficult.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:40.360]   But later in his career, he is 81 kg,
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.960]   and it's becoming more and more difficult.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.560]   So that's the other thing with him,
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.340]   is, so I've known a lot of really, really tough people
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:53.080]   at the highest levels broken by the weight cut.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.440]   Like that can break the toughest minds.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.960]   And it doesn't seem to have broken him.
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.560]   And he's delivered on it often,
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.300]   on like insane weight cuts.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.800]   So just as a coach, what do you think about his,
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:10.720]   particularly his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.440]   - It was part of his process.
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.160]   It was part of his way of getting ready for battle.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.160]   - Suffering?
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.880]   - Yeah, it really was.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.480]   And if I'm gonna suffer this much,
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.480]   then I'm gonna make my opponents pay
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.880]   for all the suffering that I went through to get here.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.060]   That was his mindset.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.140]   Later on in his career, you're right,
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.280]   like a lot of times, Travis,
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.440]   he would never step on a scale
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.240]   until he got to the tournament.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.640]   And even when he'd get to the tournament,
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.580]   he'd weigh like 90 kilos.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.600]   He'd show up at the tournament nine kilos over.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.760]   I'm like, you have to, but I never,
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.640]   it was just an expectation of making weight.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.400]   Not making weight was never an option
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.720]   for any of our athletes.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.200]   And Travis knew it.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.960]   And he said, as a professional,
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.400]   my job is to make weight.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.640]   If I don't make weight,
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   he was never gonna allow that to happen.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.760]   And he was never gonna allow us to come to him and say,
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.920]   hey, I told you.
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.800]   'Cause losing wasn't an option,
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.900]   making a weight wasn't,
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.740]   not making weight was not an option for him ever either.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:14.360]   But a lot of times, he wouldn't even,
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360]   he'd be nine kilos over on the plane
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.000]   going over to the tournament
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.040]   and have to make weight three days later.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.200]   And he didn't break 86 kilos
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.800]   until the day before the tournament.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.800]   Like he had five kilos over the day before.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.840]   That was his way.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.560]   But he would do three workouts,
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.760]   wake up in the morning, workout,
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.600]   then he'd eat,
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.720]   then he'd work out in the afternoon,
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.560]   then he'd eat again,
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.600]   then he'd work out again at night.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.840]   And then he'd reward himself.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.000]   Hey, I worked out three times today.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.560]   He'd go have a Mountain Dew.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.120]   Or a chocolate bar.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.360]   And then his next morning,
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.400]   he's back up to 87
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.000]   He would never touch weight
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.600]   until the morning of weigh-ins.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.780]   He wasn't on weight for more than like five minutes.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:00.800]   His process would break a lot of people.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.560]   So the fact that he got the job done is.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.840]   Not just the job done,
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.440]   but every single time he got the job done.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.160]   And I made those athletes fight.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.480]   We would fight in Paris.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.320]   We would do a camp for a week,
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.440]   double session camp for a week.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.560]   He'd be seven kilos over,
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.760]   have to fight the next weekend.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.280]   We're talking two or three days later.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.560]   Not only did he make the weight,
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.440]   but he did a grueling training camp twice a day,
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.560]   and then cut weight and then fought again.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.200]   Then did another camp for a week
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.800]   in double session training camp,
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.440]   and then fought on a third weekend in a row.
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.360]   And our athletes went through hell.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:38.720]   All of our athletes went through hell
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.340]   'cause on the tour around the world,
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.880]   they fought in every event,
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.000]   they did every camp,
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.600]   they fought in every event.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.260]   Whereas most of the other teams,
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.180]   like Japan comes in and fights in Paris,
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.480]   then they go home.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.720]   They maybe do a camp for three days,
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:53.880]   then they go home.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.680]   They don't stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.960]   and fight in every tournament.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.480]   And when you get to Germany,
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.360]   the Germans skip the French Open,
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.540]   they skip the camp in France,
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.240]   they're just getting ready for Germany.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.160]   Our athletes already had two competitions,
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.520]   two training camps,
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.080]   two weight, three weight cuts now.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.280]   And then, so they're not 100% when they fight in Germany,
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.720]   but that's all part of the experience they need,
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.960]   the training that they need
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.480]   that they don't get here in this country.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.240]   And all of those were just preparation
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.520]   for our world championships or our Olympic games.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.560]   So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.600]   they felt so strong, so rested,
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:33.000]   so like, man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.600]   feels like nothing today
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.160]   because you're fully rested now.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.500]   But part of the challenge is
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.120]   because the American team is smaller
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.040]   and more, I mean, just smaller,
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:49.040]   is all the different places you go to do the weight cut,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.760]   to do the diet, to do the preparation or the recovery,
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.160]   like that process changes every time.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.560]   So you basically have to improvise a lot.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.400]   - Oh yeah.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.800]   - You show up to a hotel
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.680]   and how you do the weight cut, you don't know,
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.320]   and the different weather conditions,
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.080]   it's not, it's like,
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:12.520]   so what is it, Rocky versus Drago, right?
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.360]   - Right, right.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.160]   - So you don't have, you have to just improvise.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.840]   And that's also a fascinating part
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.080]   of the American judo story,
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.880]   which is like, you have to improvise more.
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.600]   - Well, it was funny 'cause when I,
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.000]   it was 1990 and it was at the Goodwill Games, right?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.400]   And we were, it was a US Olympic Committee type event.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:31.560]   And so we're on the bus with the swim team.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.520]   And it was me and Jason Morris on the American team.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.400]   We're going to the judo competition,
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.160]   but we're on the bus with the swim team.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.960]   I'm sorry, we're going to the venue where we're staying.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.480]   I remember being like by ourselves with no staff,
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.240]   no manager, no coach.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.320]   We're just by ourselves going to fight in Russia, right?
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.800]   And the swim team's on there with their full sweats
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.920]   and their staff and like their managers.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.680]   And I heard the girl go, I'm sorry, this was 1994
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.160]   'cause it was in St. Petersburg, Russia.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.520]   So I heard the girl on the team, she goes up to the coach.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.800]   She goes, "Coach, do you think you can send
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.040]   the massage therapist to my room at 10 a.m.?
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.320]   You know, I'm feeling kind of jet lag."
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.400]   I looked at me and Jason, we looked at each other like,
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.680]   she's scheduling a massage?
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.720]   We don't even have a staff.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.400]   Like what the hell is going on here?
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.480]   You know, what a difference in sporting,
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.040]   you know, different sports within the same country.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.920]   - But that, I mean, not to romanticize things,
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.640]   but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.360]   when you're kind of, the improvisational nature of it.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.420]   'Cause it is just you.
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:44.000]   You and sometimes you and the coach and just pure guts
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.480]   and you against the world with no money.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:48.560]   - The warrior spirit.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.660]   - The warrior spirit.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:56.420]   How did it feel like when he, after being in two Olympics,
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.080]   beating some of the best people in the world,
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.320]   facing some of the best people in the world
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.480]   and just barely losing, what did it feel like to you
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.620]   as a coach to see Travis Stevens win the silver medal?
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.840]   - Electric.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.860]   First of all, in 2012 in London,
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:20.100]   it was like, it felt like somebody died.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.600]   I'm not gonna lie to you.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.400]   - The Ole Bischoff match?
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.020]   - Not, no, just seeing Travis not finish
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.120]   on the podium, period.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.320]   You know, in the Ole Bischoff match,
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.600]   I thought he won regardless of who won and who lost.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.960]   He just left everything he had on that mat, right?
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.700]   10 minutes of probably it was a 20 something minute match,
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.860]   but 10 minutes of fighting actually, right?
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.060]   He left everything he had.
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.460]   He wanted to be in the Olympic finals.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.140]   He wanted to be Olympic champion.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.860]   And when he didn't get that opportunity,
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.860]   he lost everything.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:50.300]   He drained himself.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.720]   He cried for 45 minutes straight.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.820]   I couldn't regroup him.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.780]   I couldn't get him up.
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.900]   I said, Travis, you've got to stop your crying.
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:58.440]   You've got to get off the floor.
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.220]   We've got a bronze medal fight.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.780]   Like if you don't recover, you're not gonna perform well.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.940]   And he just didn't care.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.980]   Like it was gold or nothing.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:09.740]   And so when he walked out against the Canadian boy,
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:10.620]   he had beaten the Canadian.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.000]   I think at that time,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.060]   he had beaten that Canadian every single time,
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:16.060]   except for that bronze medal match.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.460]   But he just didn't have the fight in him anymore.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.720]   You know, he'd left it all out in the match
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.980]   in the Bischoff match.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:23.160]   So to see him come back with zero, right?
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.980]   We just had a team where his best friend,
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:29.180]   Marty Malloy won a bronze medal, right?
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.620]   Then the day after Travis fights,
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:34.180]   Kayla Harrison goes and wins her first gold medal, right?
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.020]   Her first ever gold.
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.060]   So we have a gold and a bronze.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.460]   His training partner wins a gold.
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:41.220]   His best friend from growing up wins a bronze.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:42.860]   He has nothing, right?
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:46.980]   To see him for four years go through hell,
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.580]   like literally like all of his injuries,
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:52.480]   every training camp, and then forget the humiliation
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.540]   because every time any reporter ever came to my dojo,
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:57.620]   they want to talk to Kayla.
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.100]   She's the Olympic champion.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.700]   Who's this Travis guy?
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.700]   You know, who is this guy?
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.540]   You know, so he didn't medal.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.300]   You know, he's not that important.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:06.980]   And you know, up until right,
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.820]   till you get to the right before the Olympics,
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.940]   now they talk about he's an Olympian again.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.780]   And yeah, but up until that point,
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:16.500]   and then every little kid sees Kayla's medal.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.780]   Oh, Travis, yeah, you went to the Olympics.
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:19.620]   Where's your medal?
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.540]   How did you do?
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.900]   You know, he was, I took fifth, I didn't place.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:25.660]   You know, it's the lowest of low every day
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.400]   having that constant reminder.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.740]   So four years later, when that guy,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.700]   I mean, mentally, he was ready.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:37.940]   Physically, he was ready.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:41.820]   That was the best and strongest Travis Stevens
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.020]   that I've ever seen and I've ever felt.
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.420]   Like, 'cause I had to get on the mat
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:47.100]   and do some drills and stuff like that,
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.100]   and like try to defend armbars,
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.340]   'cause we didn't have a lot of bodies in Rio.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.140]   And I was like, my God, he's,
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:53.980]   I said after one of the practices,
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:56.620]   this is the strongest I've ever felt that guy, right?
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:59.120]   Before the competitions, physically he was ready.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.960]   Mentally, the morning of competition,
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.620]   I said to Travis, I looked him in the eye
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:06.380]   and I said, you know, we're ready to go over to the venue.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:07.980]   I said, are you ready today?
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.260]   And he just looked at me like, he goes,
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:12.380]   "I am gonna shock the world today."
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:14.140]   That's what he told me, "I'm gonna shock the world today."
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.940]   And I said, all right, great, let's go, right?
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:21.100]   So we go to the venue and every other athlete
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:24.500]   was just like nervously, like doing repetitions
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:27.100]   of Uchi Komis, you could see like sweat coming out.
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.820]   You could see like all this nervous energy
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.580]   going through their body.
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:32.820]   And here comes Travis Stevens,
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.480]   he's got these big goofy headphones on.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.220]   He's got a tank top that says USA on it.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:41.260]   He's got the swim trunks that say USA,
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.340]   like that have shiny letters that glow in the dark.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:47.620]   And he's like, and this is in the middle of the judo hall
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.780]   where all these athletes are warming up
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:50.060]   for their first match.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.260]   He's like dancing around, like doing this loose warmup,
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:56.740]   like almost like a little kid at an amusement park
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.540]   whose dad said, "Yeah, go play."
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.940]   And it was like, he had waited four years for that moment.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:05.700]   He was so relaxed, so focused, so relaxed,
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.380]   and couldn't wait.
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:08.700]   It was like a caged tiger.
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.700]   Like if you like coming out of the chute
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:14.820]   to go step onto the mat, was like this tiger
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.300]   that you were just letting out of the cage and he just go,
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:18.660]   like now's your time to go fight.
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.420]   And that's what he did that whole day.
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:25.140]   And like when he beat Chirikishvili in the semis
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:27.860]   and choked him out and won that fight,
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.860]   like there's nobody with the exception of maybe
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.300]   the guys in the American team,
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.660]   there was nobody in that stadium
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:37.180]   that expected Travis to beat him.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.100]   - Yeah. - Nobody.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.460]   - Yeah. - Like, you know,
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.420]   he had smashed Travis, I don't know how many times
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:44.580]   before that for Epone, like in the first minute even.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.020]   It wasn't even a fight, right?
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:49.140]   And it was great game plan.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.760]   - He's the world number one at the time too.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:55.140]   - World number one at the time,
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:59.940]   world champion, carried the flag for the Georgian Federation
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.480]   walking into the games,
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:06.340]   most dominant 81 kilo player in that weight class
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.220]   for quite some time.
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:11.180]   And man, we just had his number
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.220]   and Travis was ready to go.
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:15.220]   It was so cool, it was so awesome.
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.340]   We was, I mean, we had already won,
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:20.220]   Kayla had already won her second gold, right?
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.340]   The way the event went and Travis winning that
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.340]   was like icing on the cake for our team.
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.220]   That was the best performance we've ever had in history.
[01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:30.060]   It's awesome.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.620]   - So you mentioned Kayla,
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:36.620]   she is one of, if not the greatest American judoka ever,
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.540]   two time gold medalist.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.980]   - 2010 world champion.
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.820]   - 2010.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:43.860]   - For Senior Worlds.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.580]   - Senior Worlds.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:49.220]   What makes Kayla special?
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.420]   What makes her so great?
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:53.300]   What made this champion?
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:57.500]   - It's a combination of a lot of things.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:01.260]   One was obviously Kayla's mental toughness, right?
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.440]   To overcome what she overcame.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.800]   This is a girl who,
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:10.380]   let's, I don't wanna say forget about the sexual abuse,
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:13.340]   but the fact that she had to go through that in life
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.900]   and learned how to compartmentalize that
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.900]   and keep that off as a separate part of her brain
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:21.140]   and forget about it and move on.
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:23.780]   That took an incredible team to help her do that.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:28.220]   And my dad was a huge part of her accomplishing that.
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.580]   - So for people who don't know,
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:32.540]   we should comment and say that Kayla had to go through
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:37.460]   trauma in her earlier life through sexual abuse
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:39.780]   and had to overcome that through the whole process
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:43.260]   of becoming a champion as well.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.000]   - Because she had zero self-esteem, zero self-worth.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.460]   She was at the lowest of lows
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:51.620]   and didn't even wanna be on this earth, right?
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:56.220]   So she was traumatized obviously for,
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:57.500]   and getting her the right help
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.120]   and surrounding her with the right people
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.500]   who could help her get through that
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:05.060]   and be by her side as she's getting through that
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.820]   and letting her know and reaffirming
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.420]   that she's doing the right thing
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:09.820]   and she made the right decision
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.820]   and she should have zero guilt.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:14.100]   And this doesn't define her.
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:15.860]   It happened to her, but it doesn't define her.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:18.620]   What defines her is what she does from now on.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:21.620]   And then rebuilding that person to become who she became.
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.380]   I think the mental toughness is a big part of it, her mind.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:31.740]   But then as an athlete, she's a lot like Travis.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:35.060]   She's a warrior, she's a fighter.
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.220]   My dad always jokes with her.
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:39.300]   He says, "You're a workhorse.
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.220]   You're not a thoroughbred.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.500]   We're not gonna treat you like a thoroughbred, right?
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:45.260]   You're a workhorse, so you're gonna work.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.900]   And the way you're gonna get bigger and stronger
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:47.740]   is you're gonna work harder
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:49.180]   and you're gonna keep..."
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.860]   She came to us when she was only 15.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:53.060]   So at that time, we got her
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:55.260]   with a really good strength and conditioning coach.
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:58.020]   We did all the core Olympic style lifting.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.380]   As her body was developing,
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:02.380]   she was getting stronger every single day.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:06.280]   And then she had the luxury of being on the mat with,
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.380]   at the time I was still young enough to train
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.500]   and be on the mat and I was around her weight class
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.140]   and Travis was able to train with her.
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:15.540]   And we had all the top US athletes at the time
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:16.700]   training here at my school.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.140]   So she got the benefit of all the best guys
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:21.060]   to train within the country.
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:25.260]   And her doing all of those rounds, night in,
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:28.700]   every night, every week, every year,
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.300]   compiled with the best,
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.700]   highest level she could as a girl.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.420]   She got the strength, she got the technique,
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:35.260]   she got the...
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:36.660]   And then she had the coaching on top of it
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.180]   with my dad being on her as working her out
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.420]   and having the wherewithal to develop a strategy
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:44.240]   and a plan for her.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:46.260]   Because when she first came here,
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.260]   she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:55.100]   At the time, Ronda Rousey was also training here
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:56.980]   and she was 70 kilos.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:00.300]   So if Kayla was struggling making 63,
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.820]   so the only way to, obviously,
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:04.260]   the only way to still compete is to move up.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.780]   But my dad said, "Well, if you move up,
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:06.900]   "then you're in Ronda's weight.
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.020]   "So let's skip that weight.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.620]   "You're gonna go to 78 kilos."
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.460]   And he told her, "Listen,
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:12.540]   "you're gonna go up two weight classes."
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.420]   She looked at him and was like, "That's 172 pounds."
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:17.380]   And he goes, "Well, I don't care.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.420]   "You're already struggling making 138.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:20.320]   "You weigh 150.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.160]   "What's the difference?
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.260]   "We put 20 pounds on, go to 170."
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.980]   So that's why she jumped two weights,
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:26.500]   'cause she passed Ronda.
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.540]   She went to the weight above
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:29.100]   so she could make the national team
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.980]   and she had a chance to go to the Olympics and all that,
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:35.020]   'cause we envisioned Ronda staying around till 2012.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:37.340]   - And that's also like a long-term vision
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:40.380]   because you kind of grow into that body then over time.
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.540]   - Correct. - So you can dominate.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:43.940]   You can learn what it's like in that weight class.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.060]   You can learn to dominate that weight class,
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:47.740]   excel and then dominate.
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:50.020]   - People that cut weight too hard, too long,
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:51.300]   they forget about technique
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.980]   'cause they're only worried about losing weight.
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:54.540]   They're always tired in training.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.060]   They don't give 100% effort.
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.380]   They're not getting better.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:00.420]   She now is just focused on getting better at judo
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.820]   and getting bigger, getting stronger,
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:02.680]   getting more powerful.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:04.700]   So I think giving her that purpose,
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:06.540]   and that was a great call.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:09.660]   - What are some memorable
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:11.940]   or maybe the most memorable moment,
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:14.720]   Kayla Harrison moment to you as her coach?
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.340]   Not the most, perhaps, let's say,
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:21.140]   what are some memorable moments?
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:23.620]   - Everybody hears the good ones, right?
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:26.220]   So everybody knows she won the world championships
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.780]   in Tokyo in 2010.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:31.900]   She was our two-time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.140]   I'll never forget those moments, right?
[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.400]   'Cause they're historic.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.660]   One of the biggest moments
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.100]   that I like sharing this story with everybody
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:45.860]   is that in 2010 in January,
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:48.020]   Kayla was still a developing athlete,
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.260]   and we had a local tournament in New York.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.700]   It was in Brooklyn, New York.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.600]   It was called the Sterrett Cup.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.180]   And I knew that at that tournament
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:57.200]   that two of the Canadian girls,
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.740]   they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world.
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.520]   They weren't superstars, but they were tough players.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.740]   Both of them I knew were gonna be at that tournament.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:06.980]   So I said, "Kayla, we're gonna go to this tournament.
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:08.500]   "You're gonna compete against the Canadian girls,
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.040]   "get some good experience,
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.200]   "figure out what you need to work on,
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.780]   "and then we'll go home and work on some stuff."
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:14.900]   Well, she went to the tournament.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.500]   There was only three girls in the weight,
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.400]   her and the two Canadians.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.700]   At that tournament, she lost both fights, right?
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.740]   So this is January, 2010.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.300]   She lost both matches.
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:27.220]   She was competitive,
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.380]   but certainly things she needed to work on,
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.500]   it was good development thing for her and for us.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:33.680]   It also opened her mind to say,
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.820]   "Oh, man," 'cause she was already
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:39.460]   a junior world champion at the time.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.880]   But so now there's another level.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.120]   This is a senior level, right?
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:43.360]   You gotta go up another level.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.460]   Here's two girls that aren't even medalists
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.300]   that are beating you.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:48.080]   So now there's more work to be done.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.520]   And so I like telling that story
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.440]   because everybody sees the champions in the greatest moments.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.560]   They don't see them when they have bad days.
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.680]   And could you imagine being O and two?
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.600]   You feel like a failure, right?
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:06.600]   But 10 months later was Tokyo, 2010.
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:09.640]   She went from O and two at Starrett, New York
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:15.920]   to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.200]   I mean, that's an amazing turnaround.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.520]   And that's only possible if you put the losses
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.320]   in their proper context.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.560]   You don't let it destroy you mentally
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.080]   and just keep moving forward.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:28.920]   Correct.
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.120]   So funny.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.360]   So you were there at 2010 at the Starrett Cup?
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.000]   Was Travis there?
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:37.680]   I made all those.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.920]   We fought at every local.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.540]   Like the mentality of our team was
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:43.800]   no tournament is beneath us.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:47.880]   If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the world and win,
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.580]   there's no tournament that's beneath us.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:50.880]   We're gonna get experience.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.820]   We're gonna fight.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:52.840]   We're gonna learn.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.020]   We're gonna compete.
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:55.160]   We're gonna get better.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:59.920]   I actually just as a funny little side,
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:01.880]   I was there, I competed.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:02.720]   Really?
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.160]   This is one of the earlier tournaments,
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.480]   like the beginner division.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.760]   Oh no, I actually did black belt division too.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.040]   (laughing)
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.840]   That was one of the, actually, yeah, I remember that.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.200]   That's when it was so early that I thought,
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.000]   like I was also really strong at that time,
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.140]   just like physically like power lifting stuff.
[01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:24.300]   So I thought like it'll be good experience
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.520]   to also do a black belt division.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:29.680]   And remember it must've been actually Travis's division,
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.520]   which is funny.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.720]   Is Legere brothers?
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.560]   Harry and Gary.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.640]   They are super, they're super good
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.720]   and they're super dominant,
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.500]   but I think Travis faced one of them and beat them.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.400]   I don't know, I just remembered,
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:48.680]   it's funny how there's just like these little roads
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:51.380]   that later reconnect.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.440]   But yeah, there's some incredible people there.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:57.480]   And I saw obviously the positive things
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.880]   and it's interesting that Kayla's story
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.520]   was also intersecting there.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.760]   And that was one of the lower points for her.
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:07.000]   Another story I like to share is that
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000]   you have to know your athletes, right?
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.440]   And you have to really get to know their psychology,
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.000]   what they're thinking psychologically,
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.560]   mentally, what's going through their head.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.060]   Another story was in Tokyo.
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:25.060]   It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam.
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:28.840]   So we had had Kayla face off against almost
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.920]   all the top girls in her division.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:34.120]   She had beaten everybody going into the 2016 Olympics.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.640]   But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam,
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.680]   there was a girl from Japan
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.240]   that she hadn't fought in a long time
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.400]   and she lost to the girl last time she fought her.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:47.500]   So it was something we wanted her to beat this girl
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:48.560]   going into the Olympics
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.660]   so that she knew she could beat everybody.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:54.640]   And it was a first round match
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.920]   and it was going to be tough for Kayla, right?
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.160]   It was going to be a really hard fight.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:02.520]   And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.360]   leading up to that.
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.560]   So her confidence was really high,
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.600]   but at the same time,
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:08.700]   she didn't think she needed this fight.
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:13.840]   And she showed up to the tournament and she said,
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.400]   "I don't think I can fight today.
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.160]   "I've got a stinger in my neck.
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:18.640]   "I've got a stinger coming down my neck
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:20.360]   "and I'm kind of sore."
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:21.760]   She didn't tell us.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.400]   She went and told the trainer.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.720]   She walked around, she's holding her neck
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.760]   and me and my dad were like, "What's up with her?"
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.600]   I don't know.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:29.440]   (laughing)
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:31.560]   And then so, like, I don't know,
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:32.960]   maybe she doesn't want to fight today, I don't know.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:34.620]   Right?
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.960]   So all of a sudden the trainer comes up to us
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.000]   and she didn't come to us.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:37.840]   The trainer came to us and says,
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.680]   "You know, I really don't think it's a good idea
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.600]   "that Kayla fight today."
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.620]   And we looked at him and like,
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.680]   "Well, your opinion doesn't really matter, does it?"
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.520]   Right?
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.160]   Like, what's up with her?
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:49.820]   "Oh, she has this thing in her neck.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:51.720]   "It's like a pinched nerve and there's this."
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.240]   And then we talked.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.960]   I said, "Is there a risk of her getting injured?
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:58.600]   "Like, is this pain or is this risk
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:54:59.580]   "that she's going to get injured
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:01.400]   "and she's going to set her back like long time
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:02.800]   "in her career?"
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:04.400]   He says, "No, she's not going to get injured.
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.280]   "Just a pinched nerve,
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.560]   "a little pain she's going to have to deal with."
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.760]   I go, "Okay, well, can you fix the pain?"
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.480]   He says, "Yeah, I can do this and that
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.760]   "and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away."
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.640]   I said, "Okay, then do that."
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.180]   And so Kayla comes up, she goes,
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.960]   "Didn't the trainer talk to you?"
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.280]   I said, "Yeah, he talked to us."
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.200]   Well, he said, "I can't fight."
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.120]   I know, but we already talked to the trainer and.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.680]   (laughing)
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.520]   I love it.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:27.720]   And you're good to go.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.400]   She looked at us like,
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.660]   and then we had to talk to her and say,
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:34.140]   "Listen, you're not injured, you're in pain
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:35.520]   "because we just came from a camp."
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.000]   I said, "You're in pain, but here's the deal.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.340]   "We want you to fight this girl.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:41.180]   "Why don't you go out there and beat this girl, period.
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:42.600]   "I don't care, but I want to know
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:43.500]   "that you can beat this girl.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.540]   "This is why we came.
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:48.240]   "This is our last hard tournament before the Olympic games.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.440]   "This is what we want from you."
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.360]   And lo and behold, she understood.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.800]   They gave her a quick shot.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.720]   The rest of the world thought we were crazy
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:57.920]   making her compete.
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.760]   And then she went out there, she fought,
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:03.120]   didn't even know she was injured.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:04.040]   No, you know what I mean?
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.000]   She just went out there, she fought the tournament,
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.400]   she beat the Japanese girl,
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:09.720]   she ended up going through the whole tournament.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:12.480]   She took a gold medal, she won the event.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.280]   That turned out to be a great confidence builder.
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.400]   And that kind of sets you up for all the chaos
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:23.120]   that can happen at the Olympic games.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.000]   And it tells you, if you can beat these girls
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.440]   when you're not 100% and you're not at your best,
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.800]   you're physically beat, mentally beat,
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.360]   imagine what you're going to do when you're fresh.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.080]   Well, when she was going to the Olympic games,
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.760]   there's a lot, she had the mental game-
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.600]   Down.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:39.440]   Down.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.260]   Down.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:41.100]   There wasn't a girl in that division
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.920]   that thought they could beat Kayla going into those games.
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:44.580]   Not a one.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.600]   They just looked at her and went, "No, not happening."
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.440]   That's great.
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.080]   I mean, she's a great Olympic champion,
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.600]   two-time Olympic champion.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.720]   But there is something that she's commented on,
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:00.080]   which is she's suffered or went through depression
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.440]   after winning her second Olympic gold.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.120]   Why do you think this happens?
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:08.200]   You often hear stories of great champions
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:11.040]   becoming depressed after the Olympics.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.360]   There's a lack of purpose afterwards, right?
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:18.480]   Because you've done in life what you set out to do.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.560]   You've had a goal every day you woke up.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:21.920]   You knew what your purpose was.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.880]   You knew what your day looked like.
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.920]   You knew why you were doing that.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:31.640]   And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.800]   and you're all happy.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.840]   But then you wake up and you go, "Now what?
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.440]   I don't have a next."
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:42.200]   And also because there was nothing for her,
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:46.440]   there was no path set out for Kayla that said,
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.080]   "Okay, you're going to become an ambassador,
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.800]   a global ambassador of judo.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.000]   The IJF is going to help pay a salary.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.320]   The USA judo is going to give you a salary.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.440]   Here's what we want you to go teach children.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:01.040]   We want you to go be an ambassador for women.
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.480]   We're going to fly you around."
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.920]   And whatever it is, "We're going to give you a job
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.600]   and here's what you're going to do if you'd like to take it."
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.600]   There was nothing for her.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:12.520]   I remember doing the interview at the Olympics with her
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:13.800]   and they said, "Are you going to compete
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:14.720]   in the next Olympics?"
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.760]   And I said, "No."
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:16.720]   Like, "Why?
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:18.000]   She's already a two-time gold medalist.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.760]   What does three-time gold medalist do for her?"
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.240]   Nothing, right?
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.880]   Doesn't motivate her to do it again.
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:24.960]   They said, "Are you doing MMA?"
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.480]   I said, "No, why would she do MMA?
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.800]   That's ridiculous.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.280]   Like, she doesn't need MMA.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.480]   She should be able to make a living
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.200]   off of what she's accomplished in this sport
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.120]   for the rest of her life."
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.720]   But what happens is,
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:39.960]   and what most people don't understand is,
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.760]   once you say, "I'm retired,
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.720]   I'm no longer competing in the sport of judo,"
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.880]   you don't get a salary from USA Judo anymore,
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.000]   which she was getting.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.200]   I think she got like $72,000 a year
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:55.120]   from USA Judo at the time.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:59.920]   You don't get a stipend from the Olympic Committee anymore.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.120]   Goes away.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.440]   Your sponsor, like the New York Athletic Club,
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.720]   was a great sponsor for her for all those years.
[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:08.760]   In fact, she could have never been the athlete she became
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.800]   without the support of the NYC.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.640]   'Cause I talked to them when she was 15.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.160]   I said, "Hey, I got a girl that's really good.
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:17.920]   Someday, if you invest in her now,
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.120]   I promise you she'll pay back for you."
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:22.400]   And I remember the day she won the Olympic gold,
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:25.040]   I called the guy up, I said, "Hey, I told you."
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:28.600]   So, but they can no longer give you stipends
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:30.880]   because you're not competing and representing them anymore.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.160]   So that goes away.
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:36.200]   All of your sponsorships and all of your money
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:38.480]   that you would make from your TV commercials or whatever,
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:40.840]   that didn't happen for her after the Olympics
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.800]   'cause judo's a obscure sport, right?
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.800]   So she didn't have any opportunities for that.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:48.800]   At the end of the day, she has no revenue coming in.
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:49.640]   How do you live?
[01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:52.360]   You get a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.600]   or whatever for winning a gold.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.920]   But aside from that, you're not gonna live on that money.
[01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:00.040]   So no purpose, no goal, right?
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.640]   What am I gonna wake up and do tomorrow?
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.480]   I don't know.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.560]   So she has no direction.
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:06.440]   And then at the same time, she has no money coming in.
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.640]   So everything shuts off.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.720]   So now it's like, where do you turn?
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:10.560]   What do you do?
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:15.200]   And that leads to being depressed because yeah,
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.560]   even though I've accomplished all this stuff,
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:18.920]   I'm kind of lost in life.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.040]   Like what's next for me?
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:23.400]   - And I guess you just have to ride that out
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:28.400]   because when you're a great human being, great champion,
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:32.400]   life has a way of helping you find a way.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.760]   I mean, she's in mixed martial arts now,
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.640]   but she has a lot of stuff going on.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.760]   - Right.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:41.320]   Well, her kids, she adopted her sister's kids.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.160]   So she's their legal guardian now.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:44.560]   So that is her purpose, right?
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.520]   Raising these kids and making them part of her family.
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.120]   And she's fortunate enough that she has enough money
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.880]   that she can do that and she can give them a good life.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:56.440]   - I'm gonna ask you to start some trouble,
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.600]   but I heard that she said somewhere
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:02.000]   that she can beat Khabib Nurmagomedov in judo.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.160]   What do you think?
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.480]   - To be honest with you, I mean,
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:06.560]   I don't know what level of judoka.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.400]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.220]   - I don't know what level he is.
[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:10.900]   - But I do know that that Russian system
[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:13.260]   respects judo immensely.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.020]   - What I will tell you is this.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:18.220]   I trained with Kayla and I was an Olympic medalist
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:19.860]   and a world champion in judo.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.020]   And granted, I was older when I trained with her,
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:26.700]   but you have to go as a man, you have to go 100%
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:29.420]   or she will smash you as a man.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:31.700]   And I could tell you that if Khabib
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:34.100]   doesn't do a lot of just judo,
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.980]   doesn't like gripping and doesn't understand,
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:40.020]   like if he can throw, that's one thing,
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.860]   but if he doesn't really understand judo at a high level,
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.860]   she will throw him.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:47.220]   She would beat him in a match, in a judo contest,
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.940]   not in a mixed martial arts contest,
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.180]   not in a wrestling contest, not in a submission contest,
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:56.120]   in a pure judo match where he cannot grab legs
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:58.920]   and he has to grip up and just throw,
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.900]   I'd put my money on Kayla.
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:02.740]   - I like it.
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:04.700]   - Unless he's, if he could go place
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:06.660]   in the nationals in Russia, he would beat her.
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:08.420]   But if he's not at that level of judo,
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:10.980]   he's more like a brown belt or he's not,
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:13.020]   he's not a high level judo player, she will win.
[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:17.440]   I saw her take some of our best juniors in this country,
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.260]   some of the guys that went and won our,
[02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.560]   medaled in our senior nationals,
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:26.580]   I've seen her smash all of them in judo.
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:29.580]   Now she's not gonna do that to a Travis Stevens,
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:34.580]   she's not gonna do that to a senior national champion
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:38.180]   or Olympian in our sport, but she will go toe to toe
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:41.660]   with every other male, black belts or not.
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:48.860]   - Speaking of Khabib in Russia, Vladimir Putin,
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:51.580]   I don't know if you have heard of him,
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:55.620]   he's the president of Russia, but he's also a judoka.
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:58.420]   Have you gotten a chance to see him do judo?
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:01.500]   What do you think about his judo, if you were to analyze it?
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.300]   - I'm actually really good friends
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:04.960]   with the Russian Federation.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:09.700]   The guy in charge is Ezio Gamba, he's an Italian,
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:11.740]   he's a mastermind behind their success
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:15.000]   of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.500]   2020, he suffered from leukemia, blood cancer,
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.100]   so he wasn't part of their 2020 program,
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:23.400]   but he was part of 2012, 2016.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.580]   That whole national, the Olympic team in 2012
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:30.420]   came to our studio and lived here for a month in Boston.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:33.340]   They went to school in Boston, I brought them to my house,
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:34.980]   they had three Olympic champions.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:37.100]   - Three Olympic champions.
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.300]   Oh my God, what a team.
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.440]   - They all came and lived here in Boston for a month,
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:44.340]   they wanted to be part of like experience America
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:48.980]   type program, so I've seen all of them with Putin in Russia
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.740]   at their national training center, working out with them
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:53.660]   and taking falls and doing judo with him.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:58.060]   So, it's hard when you're older to move in judo.
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:01.580]   I mean, I was at a high level and I'm now 51,
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:03.540]   it's hard for me to move like I used to.
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:06.540]   So, at his age, he's gotta be what, 60,
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:09.060]   between 62, 65-ish?
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:13.620]   I mean, he moves really well for somebody that's that age
[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:15.980]   and probably hasn't done very much judo
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:17.820]   for the last however many years, right?
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.900]   So, it tells you, at one point,
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:21.500]   he had to be a really good judo player.
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:23.940]   - Yeah, he put in a lot of work at some point
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:25.140]   to develop the technique.
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:27.540]   You could tell when a great judo player,
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:30.220]   even if they haven't practiced it,
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:32.780]   even if they're up there in age,
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:34.380]   like just the way they move,
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:35.900]   the way they go in for a Seinagi,
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:38.140]   the way they go for a particular throw,
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:40.280]   the way they do foot sweeps and all that kind of stuff,
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.300]   you could just tell he's good at judo
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.900]   and that's kind of fascinating.
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:48.220]   It's fascinating to see political leaders.
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:50.740]   I've gotten to interact with quite a few
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:55.020]   for whom judo was a formative experience in their life
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:57.260]   and that's so interesting that for a lot of people,
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:00.660]   judo played a big part in their life, early development.
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:04.300]   It's similar to if you served in the military.
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:06.020]   There's just something about judo.
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:09.660]   As a martial art, it's not just the technique.
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:13.220]   So, yes, there's something about gaining confidence
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:17.100]   through becoming aware of what your body can do,
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:20.500]   the artistry and the skill of it,
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:22.500]   also the power, being able to dominate
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.680]   another human being with technique,
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.900]   but also the, I don't know, the formality,
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:33.600]   the discipline of just honoring the tradition of it.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.000]   So all of that mixed together somehow creates--
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:37.880]   - Memories.
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:40.620]   - It creates memories that kind of define you
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:42.740]   as a human being and that you carry that forward
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:45.160]   throughout your life and I've just been surprised
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:48.420]   to know how many powerful people internationally
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:53.420]   have in their heart, who they are, judo
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:54.520]   has the core of it. - For sure.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:57.660]   It makes you the human being that you are.
[02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:58.500]   It really does.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:02.300]   It becomes a fabric of, the people that stick with it,
[02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:04.400]   right, that stay with it because it,
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:07.540]   I mean, it teaches you so many lessons.
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:09.660]   It's so memorable because of what you talked about,
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:14.660]   the tradition, but it's also, you grow with other people
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:16.580]   and you learn from other people
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:19.060]   and you experience things with other people.
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:24.060]   It's such a hands-on sport that it's very memorable
[02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:26.000]   and people love it so much.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.100]   Like right now at my dojo, we have like four generations.
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:34.120]   Like somebody that did judo with my dad had a kid
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:39.080]   who trained with me, who loved judo so much, had a kid.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:43.960]   That kid was now in his 20s who did judo
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.920]   and now has a kid who's two or three or four
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.280]   that's coming to my toddler program at my school.
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:49.980]   Like we're talking four generations
[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:52.620]   and they all love the experience so much
[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:54.760]   and what it did for them and their lives
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:56.500]   that they wanted the next generation
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:58.200]   to also experience the same thing.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:02.680]   - This is a tricky question, but if people are interested
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:04.880]   in judo and wanna start learning it,
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:07.520]   in the United States there's thousands
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.720]   of jiu-jitsu schools, for example.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:13.780]   Is there advice you can give to people interested in judo
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:18.780]   or maybe to jiu-jitsu gym owners?
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:24.820]   Like how do you get judo as part of your life in America?
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.460]   - Well, I mean, if you're fortunate
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:28.860]   to live near another dojo, right?
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:30.620]   A place that has judo locally,
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:32.740]   then that's your best opportunity to learn
[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:35.060]   is to go learn from another school.
[02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:39.980]   Unfortunately, sometimes the nearest dojo might not be
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.660]   for two hours or three hours away from where you're at,
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:45.260]   which is an obstacle, you're not gonna do that.
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:47.820]   So, I mean, Travis and I did start
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:50.420]   the American Judo System online.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.340]   It's at usajudo.com and we've broken down
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:57.740]   every single judo technique to the very,
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:00.380]   very basic elements of just movement.
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:04.380]   So we teach every technique of how you do it mechanically
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:07.180]   with just your feet, then how you incorporate your hands
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:11.160]   and your feet together, how you do it in all directions,
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:13.340]   moving forward, sideways, backwards,
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:17.120]   how to then introduce a partner into the movement,
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:23.020]   how to do basic uchi-komi or repetitions with a partner,
[02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:24.460]   then moving with a partner,
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:26.420]   then how to throw your opponent static,
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:27.300]   how to throw your opponent.
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:30.780]   So basically from the very foundation of the movement
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:33.100]   all the way to the most advanced level,
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:36.900]   we've documented this through separate videos.
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:40.040]   And we've taken now, I think, 12 to 15
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:42.920]   of standing techniques combined with a whole bunch
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:44.600]   of groundwork techniques.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:48.020]   And our goal is just to continue to build this platform out
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:51.480]   so that anybody, anywhere can learn online
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:52.520]   and can ask questions.
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:54.880]   We have a live training class every couple of weeks,
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:58.520]   every two weeks, he or I answer questions online
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.320]   for our members.
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:05.320]   Ideally, what we'd like to do is have a standing curriculum
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.940]   for jujitsu instructors that want to learn
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:10.040]   and become black belts in judo.
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:12.120]   Here's how, these are the techniques you need to know,
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:14.040]   this is how many reps you need to do,
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:17.240]   this is how efficient you need to get at those techniques
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:19.760]   to become certified as an instructor
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:21.440]   or become a black belt.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.040]   And eventually have an online promotion system
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.240]   where anybody, anywhere can just submit videos
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:30.160]   and show us that they can do those techniques.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.780]   And obviously we'll have people review them.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:34.200]   And this is a dream and a vision,
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.480]   but we've already started the platform.
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.920]   We're about to do a collaborative effort with USA Judo
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.920]   where all of their members will start to get access
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.400]   to this platform as well.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.580]   And if we can get that influx of money
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:48.120]   and people on the platform,
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.880]   it'll allow us to hire and grow it faster.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.640]   - So you also want to do certification there.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.320]   It's not just instruction.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.860]   - Correct.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:09:59.920]   - That would be amazing.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.320]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:02.520]   - I mean, for me personally,
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.120]   I'm mostly in Austin, Texas now.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.120]   And there's a few Judo schools, but it's not really.
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:11.600]   - Right.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.240]   - And it's just one of those cities that doesn't quite have,
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.320]   I mean, there's a few,
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.200]   it's basically just a few random Judo people
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:22.100]   that kind of gather together a couple of times a week.
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:27.100]   But it's not a system, a dojo, an instructor,
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.600]   or integrated into a Jiu-Jitsu school or not.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.960]   The problem with most Judo dojos right now
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:37.860]   is that most of them cater towards the competitive side.
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.520]   Also, a lot of them do it recreationally,
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.280]   meaning this isn't how they make a living.
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:44.880]   So they're there three nights a week,
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:45.840]   or they're there five,
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.300]   even if they're there five nights a week,
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:51.020]   it's still only one junior class and one senior class,
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:51.860]   and that's it.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.200]   And it's one size fits all.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:54.640]   Doesn't matter what level you're at,
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:55.620]   it's one size fits all.
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:58.080]   So you can't get out of the training
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:59.640]   what you're looking to get out of the training.
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:01.600]   It's whatever the instructor's teaching.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.520]   And you can't learn
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.360]   because it's not at the appropriate level for you.
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.360]   And usually you're pushed into doing Randori,
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.240]   where you have no choice,
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:11.400]   but to do the Randori part of the training.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.680]   So it's a challenge to go learn.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.240]   And then a lot of times the schools are old school,
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:20.280]   so they go make you do falls for a half hour.
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.440]   They make you do things,
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:25.280]   maybe you're a Jiu-Jitsu person who knows how to fall already
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.200]   but you haven't proven it to the Judo instructor
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.420]   and they don't break the norm
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:30.200]   and say you still have to fall for six months,
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.520]   which turns a lot of people away as well.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.160]   So it's like any business.
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.920]   If you don't deliver on your customer's expectations,
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:42.920]   you're not going to have very many customers,
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.520]   which is the way it is now.
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:47.600]   - So a lot of people do listen to this,
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.920]   but in general in the United States practice
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.280]   Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.080]   which has a lot of similarities to Judo
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:56.220]   as obviously its origins in Judo.
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.260]   How would you compare the two arts
[02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:00.820]   from the perspective of people
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:03.140]   just interested about both arts?
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:07.460]   Do you recommend people who do Jiu-Jitsu get into Judo?
[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:10.600]   How can it enrich their Jiu-Jitsu?
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:11.980]   How do you compare the two arts,
[02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:15.660]   the actual practice of it and why it might be useful to you?
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.840]   - I mean, I think that Judo is a hard sport
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:19.700]   for adults to do.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:20.860]   It just is.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:24.460]   Especially people that haven't fallen in a long time,
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:25.860]   aren't very athletic,
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:29.960]   haven't, I think about my own experience, right?
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.880]   Other than Judo,
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:33.720]   when did I ever do like a forward somersault?
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:35.680]   Maybe when I was in grade school, right?
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.080]   That's the last time I've left my feet was in grade school.
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.760]   Most people haven't got off of a chair or a couch.
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:45.000]   They spend eight to 10 hours a day
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.400]   either working behind a computer
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:48.800]   or sitting on a couch watching TV, right?
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:50.560]   And they're not that athletic.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.880]   And they haven't done anything athletic
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:54.280]   at least probably since high school.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:55.120]   - Yeah.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.440]   - It's their last athletic endeavor, most of them.
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.520]   So you're talking about as an adult that's 35 or 40
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:01.960]   wanting to start a sport,
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.080]   Judo is a really hard sport to start,
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.920]   especially in today's dojos
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.760]   that don't have a recreational adult program.
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:11.680]   You know, when it's one size fits all, it's hard.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:14.600]   So for those people, Jiu-Jitsu makes a heck of a lot
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.840]   of sense, good self-defense, it's cerebral,
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.140]   where you got to use your brain,
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:22.640]   you're a smaller person, you have to use technique.
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:25.440]   And it teaches all the same things as Judo,
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:27.080]   but it's a safe way to do it.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.160]   And because of the validation it has
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:33.120]   with the UFC and MMA today, right?
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.600]   Everybody knows Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:37.160]   So now they can be part of mainstream society
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:40.280]   and talk intelligently about what they see on television
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.240]   or what's going on on ESPN today, right?
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:43.100]   They have some knowledge.
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:45.880]   So they have an identity.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:47.920]   And also there's a good culture in Jiu-Jitsu
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:49.520]   where it's becoming a family.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.440]   You know, the dojo is the family place.
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:54.000]   You go to feel good, you go to see your friends,
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.240]   you go to get fit and you have a good time, right?
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:59.880]   So it makes a lot of sense why it's growing.
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:03.160]   Judo on the other hand, I think is a better sport
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:04.480]   for children to do.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.280]   It's more, I would say, fun and interactive.
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.880]   It's a little easier to teach the kids how to do
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:14.360]   the throwing skills and for safety and things like that.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:16.840]   Their body can handle more than the adults can.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:19.040]   They're less likely to get injured.
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:21.600]   You know, it makes them better athletes
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:24.500]   because it's a lot more three-dimensional in my opinion.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:28.400]   So I think there's a good fit between,
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:32.200]   judo can thrive from kids till, you know, whatever,
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:34.180]   high school, college.
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:37.420]   Jiu-Jitsu thrives from that 18 year old up.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:39.600]   Right now that's kind of where it is.
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.700]   - So as a dojo, you have to kind of focus on the teens
[02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:46.880]   and the college, like early twenties, that kind of-
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.640]   - Or you need to have,
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.600]   if you're going to be a successful judo dojo,
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:53.920]   you have to have that recreational,
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:56.720]   fundamental adult program in your school
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.800]   where people actually come to judo, learn the moves,
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:03.560]   but aren't pushed into randori training
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.800]   and pushed into things where they're uncomfortable
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:07.960]   and they can't control the situation
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:09.660]   because there's too many unknowns.
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:14.320]   - You got an education at Browns.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.360]   You're somebody who's amazing because as an Olympian
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.320]   and an Olympic coach, you always emphasize
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:20.960]   kind of balance and education,
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:25.960]   all of that side of life, so developing your brain too.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:29.580]   So you are an Olympic medalist,
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:33.000]   a coach of Olympic medalists, you're a business owner,
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.720]   so successful in all these domains.
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:37.040]   So I have to ask,
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.160]   what advice would you give to young people today,
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:44.240]   high school, judo age, high school, college,
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:49.240]   undergrad, how to be successful in their career
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:50.880]   or just in life in general,
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:53.540]   how to live a life they can be proud of?
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:57.960]   - I think you have to be true to yourself.
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:00.720]   You have to decide what it is you really want to do
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:02.280]   with your life.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.080]   And it's hard because when I grew up,
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.960]   I didn't know I was going to be successful.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.280]   When I was young,
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:09.080]   I didn't know I was going to be an Olympic medalist.
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.040]   I certainly did envision myself owning a couple of companies
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.680]   that makes their living exclusively for martial arts
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:17.680]   or judo 'cause that wasn't really an opportunity
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:20.600]   when I was a kid, but I've created that opportunity.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.160]   I would just say that,
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.600]   pick something that you're passionate about.
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.040]   I was stuck in a career before
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:27.960]   where I wasn't passionate about it.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:29.760]   And it was my wife who said,
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:32.000]   "Jimmy, if you can figure out
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.640]   "how to make your living exclusively from martial arts,
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:38.840]   "where your brain and your heart and your passion
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.060]   "is all towards one thing that you really like,
[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:43.340]   "then you'll be successful."
[02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:45.120]   And I left the job, I had three kids.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.960]   I was working for monster.com.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:49.820]   I was in internet marketing
[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:51.600]   and I was working for that company, great company,
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:53.040]   nothing wrong with the company,
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:56.520]   but sitting behind the desk from eight till five,
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:00.560]   and then I get to go to judo from six till nine at night,
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:02.200]   my whole day is tied up doing something
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.040]   that I'm really not passionate about.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:06.360]   She said, "If you can figure out
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:07.960]   "how to make money from your dojo
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:10.240]   "and other things judo related,
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:11.520]   "then I think you'll be successful."
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.120]   And so she's the one that my wife, Marie,
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:15.320]   gave me that advice and I would give that to others.
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:17.080]   Find something that you love doing
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:18.760]   where it doesn't feel like work,
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:20.120]   something you're passionate about.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.240]   - And if the opportunity doesn't exist,
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:25.240]   how to make money on it, you can create the opportunity.
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:26.880]   - Be resourceful, figure it out.
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:30.000]   Don't let anybody tell you you can't do it.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.320]   I didn't know that I could have a 200 person judo school
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:34.640]   that only taught judo,
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:37.280]   'cause that really didn't exist in this country.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:39.080]   You know, that actually charges money
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.400]   like jujitsu charges, right?
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.640]   We're talking not, there's plenty of clubs out there
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.200]   that charge 10 bucks a month that might have 100 people,
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:46.760]   but there's not many that, you know,
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:49.960]   where the tuition is $150 a month having 200 people.
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:54.560]   So that's a successful business, but it wasn't done before.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.560]   But be passionate about it, understand you're gonna fail,
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:00.680]   understand you're gonna get knocked down, beat up, right?
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:03.640]   There's gonna be dark days, but you gotta persevere,
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:06.640]   you gotta believe in yourself, you gotta have a plan,
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:09.600]   you have to be willing to learn from other people.
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:11.640]   And that's what I did.
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:13.960]   If I didn't know it, I brought somebody in to tell me,
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:14.840]   what am I doing wrong?
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:17.040]   Like, look from the outside, what do you see?
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.680]   Okay, great, then you gotta be willing to change,
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:21.800]   you gotta be willing to adapt, you know?
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.960]   And I think listening, believing in myself,
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:27.880]   and, you know, creating opportunity.
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:30.440]   And the other thing is helping others.
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.080]   Something I always did in my judo life
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.040]   and in my business life,
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.840]   if somebody came to me and asked for help with,
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.800]   hey man, is there something you can do to help me?
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:43.520]   I'm trying to get this thing started.
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.480]   You know, I'm trying to get this dojo off the ground,
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.600]   or I'm trying to run this event series,
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:52.560]   or, you know, I was creative in trying to figure out a way
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:54.080]   to help them make it work.
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:56.160]   'Cause if that really was their dream,
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.120]   and I could help them do their dream,
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:02.160]   I felt like that person would then give nothing
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:04.840]   but good, good comments about us, good, good,
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.560]   like they'll remember it forever.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.160]   They become like family.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:11.080]   And they'd be the best advocates for your business ever.
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.800]   And so the kids that I taught at my dojo
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:14.880]   were treated that way,
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.120]   the people that worked for me get treated that way,
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:20.120]   the people that, my customers that I work with
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:23.560]   in building their dojos get treated that way,
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:24.800]   people that ran tournaments,
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:27.320]   whether it was Grappler's Quest years ago,
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.200]   and helping that guy with a full set of mats
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:32.000]   for his, Brian Simmons with his thing,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.160]   or, you know, any of the Gracies,
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:37.480]   it just became like family,
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.120]   and then I just work hard and deliver
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.760]   on what I say I'm gonna do.
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:42.800]   If I say I'm gonna do it, I do it.
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:44.520]   You know, and I think it goes a long way.
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:48.240]   - Well, and I got a comment, so in a small way,
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:50.640]   people may not know, I think it's still on YouTube,
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.920]   we previously talked many years ago,
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:57.180]   and I remember you were so kind to me,
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:19:59.000]   and you didn't really know who I was,
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.160]   you just took me as a human being,
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.680]   you welcomed me into your dojo,
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:05.200]   and we just had a conversation on a podcast,
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:07.120]   or whatever the heck you call that thing,
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.320]   and you were just very kind,
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:12.220]   and you were also just,
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:16.360]   it was the last conversation I had
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:20.280]   when I showed up to MIT, and it stayed with me,
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:23.200]   so I resumed doing this podcast,
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:25.160]   but it stayed with me because you said,
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:29.060]   "You said that I did a good job at this,"
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:32.600]   and people, especially at that time, didn't tell me that.
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:36.260]   And just that little act of kindness
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:38.140]   is probably just a regular part of your day,
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:40.140]   you had a busy day, it was the end of the day,
[02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:42.800]   just saying that, that was powerful,
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:45.040]   and that pays off somehow,
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:49.000]   so thank you for that. - It's awesome.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.440]   But it was sincere, right?
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:52.480]   It was genuine, I felt like,
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:54.180]   I had been to so many interviews,
[02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:55.740]   when it's around Olympic time,
[02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:57.780]   there's lots of beat reporters that come out,
[02:20:57.780 --> 02:20:59.060]   and they're trying to get your time,
[02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:00.620]   and they're just, they're there
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:02.260]   'cause they have to get the story,
[02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:04.500]   for their newspaper or their television show,
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:06.980]   and a lot of times those people show up,
[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:09.780]   and they pronounce my name wrong,
[02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:11.780]   or they get something wrong about the background,
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:16.380]   or they offend me because they call me five minutes before
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:17.500]   that they're supposed to be there,
[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:18.900]   and say, "Oh, sorry, we're running late,
[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:20.020]   "we'll be there in an hour and a half."
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:21.700]   Well, I'm a busy guy too,
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:25.020]   and you know, like, but you were somebody that showed up,
[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:26.700]   was so prepared with your notes,
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:31.700]   knew everything about the history of what I had done,
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:34.500]   the questions you asked were intelligent questions,
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:35.980]   they were well thought out,
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:38.020]   and at the end of that interview,
[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:40.980]   I was really genuinely impressed,
[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:43.580]   and I wanted to let you know you did a great job,
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:45.180]   because you stood out from the rest.
[02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:46.940]   - Thank you, yeah, I mean, for me,
[02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:48.580]   it was like showing up to the Mecca,
[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:51.180]   like the track, I mean, you know,
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:53.100]   you don't always wanna just tell that to people,
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:55.860]   but you show up, you know, obviously,
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:58.620]   you're the legend of Judo in the United States,
[02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:01.540]   and so that was like, Boston is the Mecca.
[02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:03.660]   (both laughing)
[02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:06.580]   Like, that's where you travel to talk to the greats,
[02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:09.100]   so the fact that you were kind to me
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:10.940]   just stuck with me for a long time,
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:14.580]   so it pays off to be kind to others,
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:19.580]   to give 'em a chance.
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:23.140]   - Jimmy, thank you so much for giving me another chance,
[02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:24.540]   and spending your valuable time,
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:27.300]   and you've also were kind enough to invite me
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.980]   to train with you today at your dojo,
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:31.260]   so I can't wait.
[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.100]   - Let's go.
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:32.940]   - Let's go do some Judo.
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:35.300]   - Yeah, awesome, thank you, Lee.
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:36.900]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:38.380]   with Jimmy Pedro.
[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:39.940]   To support this podcast,
[02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:42.900]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:46.100]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Bruce Lee.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:50.420]   I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:55.280]   but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:59.300]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:01.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:04.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:14.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
