[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   In the last episode, in episode 82, we talked about your early impressions of
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.300]   C.S. Lewis, beginning for you when you read "Mere Christianity" in 1964, and in
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.860]   light of the upcoming National Conference here in the Twin Cities, what
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.500]   have been Lewis's most enduring marks on you and your ministry?
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.740]   Anytime I'm asked the question of influence, I always have to plead I could
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.620]   be wrong, because I think we're influenced in ways and by people we
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.820]   don't even understand completely. So here's my best effort to describe some
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.140]   of the marks that are still on me that come from C.S. Lewis. Number one, Lewis
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.820]   exposed my adolescent chronological snobbery. He's known for that.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.500]   Chronological snobbery says things are better because they're new and they're
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.700]   worse because they're old. And Lewis comes along and says nothing is better
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.820]   for being new and nothing is worse for being old. It's like saying an idea you
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.980]   had on Thursday is better than the idea you had on Tuesday. I think that's the way
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.420]   Chesterton put it. And centuries don't make truth go away. And then he
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.980]   supplemented that, after curing me of this pride, he said the old has in fact a
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.140]   very special value, because when you read an old book, it doesn't have the same
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.260]   blind spots and prejudices that your new books do, and therefore it has the unique
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.380]   potential of freeing you from things in your culture and in your life that you
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.020]   don't even know you are captivated by, which I think is the roots of why I love
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.140]   the Puritans, why I love Edwards, why when I go out to pasture as a hungry sheep on
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.740]   Monday after pouring myself out from my flock, I go back a few centuries, almost
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.500]   always, because there's just something about the air they breathe, those older
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.580]   Bible-saturated saints that contemporary writers by and large don't have.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.980]   So he just blew away my immature, silly objections to what is old and exposed
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.540]   the superficiality of always trying to be current. I mean, isn't it amazing, Tony,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.660]   that so many of us, if I hear Tony Ranke just read so-and-so, I
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.740]   kind of feel, "Oh shoot, I haven't read that yet," and I don't want to give the
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.340]   impression that I'm unread, and isn't that awful? I mean, it's just vanity through and
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.780]   through to have feelings like that, and he's been so helpful. That's number
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:02.100]   one. Number two is quiddity, the sheer amazing wonder that things exist. Not
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   that Jimmy Durante had a huge, knobbly, humped nose, and Richard Nixon had a ski
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.060]   slope nose, but that everyone you meet on the street has a nose. He just looked at
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.220]   the world, he said, "Isn't that amazing? Look, they have noses, and the holes in
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.780]   the noses are at the bottom and not the top, so the rain won't go in, and they're
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.780]   not on the front like a pig, so the wind won't blow on them and make funny sounds like
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.300]   a whistle." He saw frogs and bees and whales and stars and planets and clouds
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.580]   and roses and azaleas and peaches and pecans, red and blue and yellow, the feel
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.300]   of sandpaper and glass, the smell of bacon,
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.860]   New Moon grass. Every time I walk over to church, round about April, I hear the
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.300]   first robin sing. I think I hear the first robin sing because of C.S. Lewis,
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.980]   because a lot of people don't ever hear the first robin sing. He saw, and then
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.060]   he said what he saw in the most amazingly concrete ways, and he just
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.380]   simply looked at the two great books of God, the Bible and the world, and he
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.220]   taught me the sheer wonder of the thisness, that's what quiddity means, the
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.580]   thisness of things. So that's number two. Number three is the coming
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:46.380]   together of logic and romance, precise thinking and powerful feeling. I fell
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.900]   in love with reasoning in the 10th grade in a geometry class, and the next year in
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.460]   the 11th grade I fell in love with literature, reading, poetry, and two years
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:08.340]   later I met C.S. Lewis, and he put those two together as I never thought they
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.500]   could be. Somebody who was as razor-sharp in his thinking and reasoning as
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.340]   anybody ever heard, and somebody who was as explosively, vividly, powerfully,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.520]   imaginative as anybody I've ever heard. And those two things have marked my
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.260]   ministry probably as much as anything. The juxtaposition of logic and
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.980]   imagination, or romance, or feeling, or poetry, and Lewis is the one who
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.980]   wakened that sense of they're together, they're not separate.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.300]   Maybe one more thing. In my preaching over the years I've tried to follow
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:00.380]   this, but Lewis taught me the power of concreteness and the weakness of
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:09.660]   abstraction in the way we communicate. For example, don't say, "It's like a tree."
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:19.300]   Say, rather, "It's like an oak tree." No, no, no. Say, rather, "It's like the oak tree on
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.980]   the green hill in front of the house where I grew up." No, no, no. Don't say that.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.900]   Say, "It's like the oak tree on the green hill in front of the house where I grew
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.060]   up that had a perpendicular branch about 18 inches thick, so strong a wooden swing
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.940]   hung from it for two people to swing on on a warm summer evening just beside the
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.100]   trunk where Noelle and I carved our initials in the summer of 1968." Say that.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:57.860]   You see the difference? Abstractions are boring summaries and generalities, and so
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.180]   much of what we think and do today, it teaches students to think in
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.820]   generalities, think in abstractions. And Lewis said, "You will be a powerless
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.500]   communicator if you don't get specific, particular, touchable, seeable, smellable."
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.180]   So the impact of Lewis, not just on the way I see the past or the way I
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.900]   think about logic and feeling, but just the way I think about communication has
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.700]   has been huge to this day. Thank you, Pastor John. We will be studying the
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.260]   enduring influence of C.S. Lewis later this fall on September 27, 28, and 29 here
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.700]   in Minneapolis at the Desiring God National Conference. The conference is
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.540]   titled "The Romantic Rationalist--God, Life, and Imagination in the Work of C.S.
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.860]   Lewis." More details and registration will be available soon at DesiringGod.org
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.380]   on the blog and under the Events tab. I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.780]   listening.
