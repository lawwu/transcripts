[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Financial Show, dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.080]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.340]   Today we continue our five-part series called "You Don't Have to Be Smart to Become Financially
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.300]   Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid."
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.640]   And here today, part four is called "Avoid Catastrophe."
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.920]   I've been building on my five-part framework for wealth.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.360]   In part one, we talked about increasing your income, and I shared with you the very simple
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.440]   idea that if you're just hardworking and diligent and conscientious, you could probably earn
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   enough money in the industry you're in to become financially independent.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.920]   In part two, with regard to expenses, I talked about controlling the big expenses and just
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   keeping them under control so that you'll always have more money left at the end of
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.200]   the month than month at the end of money.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.320]   In part three, I talked about investing wisely, simply choosing a simple strategy and following
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.120]   it and not being stupid.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.600]   And today I want to talk about avoiding catastrophe.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.840]   Realistically, most of us won't face many catastrophes in our life, and you already
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.360]   know most of the things that you need to do to avoid those catastrophes.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.240]   First, you need to have an emergency fund.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.400]   Six months worth of expenses for your household is a perfect number to shoot for.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.780]   For most households, that'll be somewhere between $10,000 to $20,000.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.600]   If you'll just simply make sure that you have $10,000 to $20,000 always set aside in a bank
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.500]   account, in cash, in your home safe, or wherever you keep your valuable items, you can weather
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.480]   the vast majority of emergencies that happen.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.840]   Your great aunt Sue got sick.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.160]   You need to fly up and see her before she dies.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.560]   You've got the money to buy the plane ticket.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.760]   Car breaks down, needs a new radiator, you've got the money to pay the mechanic.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   Kid gets sick, you're out of work for a few days because your home taking care of your
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.300]   sick kid, you've got the money to make sure that your bills are paid.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.280]   You lose your job, have a hard time finding another one for a couple of months, you've
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.480]   got the money to pay your mortgage payment.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.640]   It's very simple.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.760]   Just save some money.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.980]   About six months worth of expenses.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.120]   Now more is cool, less is okay, but just aim for six months of expenses and you can just
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.680]   simply pay for the vast majority of emergencies that will happen to you.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.420]   The other types of catastrophes that most people will face are very well served by the
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.320]   insurance industry.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.880]   There's a good chance that you might wreck your car, have some medical expenses, and
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.960]   need to buy a new car.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.040]   There's also a very robust, very well run auto insurance business or industry, auto
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.520]   insurance industry, that is ready to serve you with a beautiful automobile insurance
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   policy that will make sure that you have the money to buy a new car and to pay your medical
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.360]   expenses when you get in a car accident.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.600]   Just get a good car insurance policy.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.240]   There's a decent chance you're going to get sick or hurt, you're going to have some medical
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.800]   bills and you're not going to be able to work for a certain amount of time.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.960]   Good chance of that happening.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   There is an incredibly strong health insurance industry that is dying to sell you a health
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.340]   insurance policy.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.760]   Most of the time, you don't even have to go and look for it.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.080]   You just have to sign up for it.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.200]   There's a very strong disability insurance industry with all kinds of disability insurance
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.840]   agents that would love to come to your house, sit down at your kitchen table, and design
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.280]   for you a disability income insurance policy that would make sure that your family has
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.960]   money to pay your family's bills when you're sick in bed and can't earn anything.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.480]   It doesn't cost that much.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.720]   There's a small chance you could die and leave behind spouse, children, parents, family members
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.600]   who are depending on your income for their future.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.080]   There is an incredibly strong and robust life insurance industry that is constantly marketing
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.600]   to you to try to get you to do one thing, to pick up the phone and call them.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.240]   In a sense, it doesn't really matter who you call.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.800]   You can ask the guy who's got the office down in your local bank.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.400]   You can pick up the phone and call the 1-800 life insurance number that's advertised to
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.740]   you on the evening news.
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.120]   You can say yes to the life insurance agents who are calling you, who just got into the
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.720]   business who want to sell you a life insurance policy.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.700]   Doesn't matter whether you buy it from the old big companies or from the multi-level
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.120]   network marketing companies or if you just buy it on the internet.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.080]   They're all pretty decent and they all solve the problem of making sure that your family
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.520]   has money when you die.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   There's a pretty decent chance that in the next decade or two of your investment lifetime,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.960]   the stock market's going to completely fall apart and it's going to go down by 30 to 50%.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.320]   On average, in the average investor's lifespan, there's going to be at least one, probably
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.560]   two 50% declines in the value of your stocks.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   On average, every few years, there's going to be a 15 to 20% decline.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.120]   Once a decade, there's going to be a 30, 40% decline.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.240]   You can go look up the actual numbers, but the point is to expect them.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:10.360]   Guess what, there is an incredibly robust body of research and academic study that has
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   been applied to this problem of how you can protect yourself against falling stock prices.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.680]   It's called diversification.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who would love to tell you about
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.520]   that.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.360]   But really, just go down to your library, pick up a money magazine type of thing, or
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   pick up a book, read it and do what it says, and diversify your portfolio.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.960]   There's a good chance your house will at some point in time be beat on by a hurricane or
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.040]   threatened by a wildfire or broken apart in an earthquake or have its roof ripped off
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.120]   in a tornado.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.040]   There's a decent chance your hot water heater is going to leak and flood your basement.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.280]   There's a decent chance someone's going to slip and fall on your front step.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   But the cool thing is the home insurance industry has figured out how to protect from these
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   problems.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.960]   And if you just talk to somebody who works there and just do what they say, you'll probably
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.680]   be in pretty good shape.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.080]   There's a decent chance that at some point in time, your spouse is going to decide that
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.000]   they're out of here.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.760]   Now that'll wreck your financial life.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.240]   But you know what's a pretty cool thing?
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.400]   At some point in time, they said yes to you.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.720]   And you weren't all that great, but they still said yes.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.580]   If you just simply care for them, love them, respect them, pay attention to them, and tell
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:58.320]   them about those things, and if you work on your marriage, spend a little time together,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.840]   there's a decent chance you can avoid that divorce court.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.400]   There's a decent chance that your children are going to face some really strong influences
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.360]   in their life.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.600]   And those influences may seek to cause them harm, may seek to work evil in their life
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   and not good.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.920]   But you know what?
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.300]   Most parents feel about like you do.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.560]   Not sure what to do all the time.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.440]   But realistically, it's pretty simple.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:45.340]   Discipline your children, teach them self-discipline and character, spend time with them, and be
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.120]   the parent.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.980]   Be involved and be the parent.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.760]   Not the friend, be the parent.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.160]   And if you'll do that, you could probably turn out pretty decent children who won't
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.680]   put you through extraordinary grief.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.060]   Friend, these things are simple.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.800]   You don't have to be all that smart to do anything that I just said.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.260]   You just can't be stupid.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.780]   You can't be stupid and say, "I'm not going to die."
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.240]   You can't be stupid and say, "I'm not going to get hurt."
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.040]   You can't be stupid and say, "She'll always be there."
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:34.460]   You can't be stupid and say, "Son, another time."
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:42.060]   Just listen to a country song, listen to almost any genre of music, and just commit yourself
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.700]   to not being stupid.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:53.580]   If you'll do that, you can avoid most of those major catastrophes that affect so many people.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:03.000]   You don't have to be that smart to be financially independent, but you can't ignore the things
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.780]   that you need to do and expect to avoid catastrophe.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:14.660]   All of these examples that I've given you are ordinary examples of catastrophes that
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.960]   we face and ways that we provide for them.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.980]   The vast majority of catastrophes could be avoided by most of those things that I just
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.340]   said, and you already know it.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:38.260]   So don't look for the smart answer, don't look for the really incredible hotshot idea.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:44.540]   Just focus on doing the things that you already know to do.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.540]   Thank you for listening.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.740]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.560]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.300]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.780]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:07.460]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.500]   action on it.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.900]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.240]   to a life change.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.220]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.900]   So take action.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.540]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.140]   that you care about.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:37.320]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.780]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.620]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:52.420]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.740]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.460]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
