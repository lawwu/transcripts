[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Pastor John, here's a question for you about academics and pastoral ministry.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   More than once, you've said that God seems to give special help and insight into the Bible
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   to pressured pastors because they are preparing meals for His bride, the church.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Did that have anything to do with your leaving academics,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and did this ultimately prove true for you in the 30-plus years of pastoring at Bethlehem?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   One of my fears, Tony, in leaving academia was that losing the relative leisure to study.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   What I mean by that is once you've taught the same courses several times,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   it's easier, and so you have more time, and you have summers,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and so the academic life seemed to offer a kind of leisure to study.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   One of my fears was that in losing that, I would lose the joy of discovery in biblical texts
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   because I knew that for me, those discoveries required a lot of looking at the text, a lot of time.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   But in retrospect, it didn't turn out that way.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   There are other factors besides time.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   In the pastoral ministry, there's not as much freedom to study. That's true.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   There are two other more than compensating factors.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   One is the relentless pressure to preach and teach and give devotions and write newsletters
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and speak to classes and youth events and seniors events and marriages and funerals and on and on.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And at least for me, the pastoral life was a never-ending pressure
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   to feed a group of people with a meal from the Scriptures.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And I suppose I could have viewed it differently than that.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I could have collected stories and told all kinds of things.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   But for me, almost every time I had a chance to speak to any group,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   it seemed my job was to take the Bible and dig in and find something nourishing,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   find a meal for the people and feed them the meal.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And the continual pressure to get those meals ready for the people had two effects on me.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   One was the need for me, myself, daily with prayerful desperation to be in the Word,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   to find treasures and food for my soul.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You can't run your pastoral car on yesterday's gas.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   You might fill it with the same text every day for five days, but you've got to fill it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You've got to put that text in there consciously and by faith.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I really felt that the continual danger of drying up spiritually was huge,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   of waking up some morning and being bored with the Bible
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and wanting to watch sports on TV instead of study my Bible.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And fortunately, by God's amazing grace, that never happened.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But the fear of it happening, Hebrews 3,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   "Take heed, lest there be an evil heart leading you away."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The fear of that happening kept me praying over the Word with tremendous pleas for light.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   "Lord, please don't let that happen to me. Give me light."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So that's one effect of that pressure.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It forced me over the text, into it, every day for my soul.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And the other effect of all that pressure to find nourishment for the flock
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   was to keep me looking at the book in preparation for all those events.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And specifically, looking with a view to find tasty, nourishing food for the people.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It had to be nourishing for their faith, or they wouldn't grow.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And it needed to be tasty because it's a sin to be dull with the Bible.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's a sin to be insipid and boring.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And you just drive people away.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And that pressure was, in my mind, it's only a golden gift to me.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It more than compensated for the more extended times of study in academia.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And there was one other compensating factor, it seems to me,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   that has made all the difference for the loss of leisurely study in academia.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   All my preparations felt less like academic discovery for a guild to assess
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   than like finding rations for hungry troops who will not survive the battle if I don't feed them well.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   This pastoral orientation of finding food for the troops in all those sermons and devotions
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   and homilies for marriages and funerals and commencements and retreats and all kinds of things,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   that gave me a huge sense that God was for me in this study.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   He loves His flock. He wants to feed them.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And I felt that's what I was doing.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I've been bedeviled all my life by second-guessing my motives.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So it was a great help to me to say to the Lord in my preparations,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   to join with my creation's Father as much as it lies within me, to know my own heart and to put to death selfish motives,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.860]   I renounce the desire to be thought wise or clever or smart. And I set my face now to find wonderful food for your people,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:40.820]   for their joy and their faith and their hope and their boldness and their healing and their perseverance and their holiness
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.820]   and their worship. And to the degree that God gave me the love to actually feel that, my confidence level increased
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.820]   that God would give me something for them. He would open this text and make things obvious to me that I couldn't see any other way.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:05.820]   So, leaving academia was, I think for me, a great gift. And I want to be sure to say here, because I've got a lot of friends in academia,
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:16.820]   I am not saying that if you stay there you can't have these insights pastorally. You can, but for me, I believe with all my heart,
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:27.820]   that I owe most of what I have spoken and written for the good of people, I owe it to the fact that God has loved His church
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:38.820]   and helped me feed them with wonderful food because of a pressured life of going to the pantry and looking and saying,
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:47.820]   "Where is it, Lord? Where's the food that you've got prepared for this particular people on this particular night where I'm supposed to give this devotion at this senior's gathering?"
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.820]   God has opened things to me I don't think would have been opened any other way.
