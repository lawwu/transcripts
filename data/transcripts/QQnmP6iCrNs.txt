[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Pastor John and I recently recorded a few episodes
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480]   of this podcast live in Nashville
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.440]   in front of about 2,500 friends
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.560]   who joined us early in the morning for the recording.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.120]   I know a number of you who listened were there.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.920]   So grateful to have you there in person and to see you.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.840]   There in Nashville, we addressed
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.640]   one of the most common questions that you've been asking,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.440]   that you've been sending to us.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.280]   Have a listen.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.900]   - Why is that I read the emails that come in
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.320]   and hear from podcast listeners,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.160]   there's nothing that dominates the conversation right now
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.600]   than the fact that a very prominent leader
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.160]   within our circles has quote unquote, deconverted.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.360]   You know him, he was my pastor for four years,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.560]   a beloved pastor.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.120]   A lot of people just don't know how to handle the news.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.440]   Online, there's a lot of hand wringing and finger pointing.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.600]   Is this big American evangelical celebrity culture
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.840]   gone wrong?
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.780]   Is this the consequence of huge reform conferences
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720]   even like this one?
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   Is this the backlash of the repressive purity movement
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.560]   gone wrong?
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.560]   Is this a leader who was given too much responsibility,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.320]   too young, on and on.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.720]   There's lots of finger pointing,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.140]   but I've noticed a different tone
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.400]   among self reflective leaders.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   And that is, they realize this could be me.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.000]   If he could fall, this could be me.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.280]   So what would you say to those of us in this room
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.440]   who have a healthy distrust of our own hearts,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.720]   who look at this man who has now walked away
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   from the gospel, and we say, could this happen to me too?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.280]   Could I one day walk away from the gospel,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.400]   walk away from my spouse, walk away from Christ?
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.360]   What would you say?
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.880]   >> The short answer is yes.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.440]   And the interesting thing about that answer
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.360]   is that for a lot of people,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.800]   it seems to call into question
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.920]   the doctrine of eternal security,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.760]   which I believe.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.680]   It shouldn't call into question
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   the doctrine of eternal security to say,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.240]   yes, I could commit apostasy this afternoon
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.600]   and go to hell.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.480]   I wonder if that's a jarring juxtaposition for you.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.000]   I believe in the doctrine of eternal security.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.280]   I could go to hell this afternoon.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.080]   Let me give some background and then try to
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440]   maybe say one or two helpful things
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.020]   about our present situation.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.400]   I just finished a book on providence
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   and just brimming with the sovereignty of God.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.600]   I love the sovereignty of God.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.800]   I see it on almost every page in the Bible.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.240]   It is a precious, precious doctrine to me.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.400]   And one of the ways to say it is
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   nothing you do
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   originates
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   the decisive act or impulse
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.940]   that saves you.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.360]   I think that's the wording I would use.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.440]   Nothing you feel,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.640]   nothing you think,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.620]   nothing you will,
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.240]   nothing you do
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.960]   originates
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.520]   the act of the soul
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.200]   or the act of the body
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.480]   that causes God to elect you,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.640]   predestine you,
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.640]   call you,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.200]   keep you,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.600]   or glorify you.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.760]   All of it is a free gift.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.960]   So nobody should have the mindset,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   I can keep this from happening.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.880]   I can.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.320]   No, you can't.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   God can.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.480]   Now, once you say that,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   it can throw you really off balance.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.800]   Like if you think you're in charge of your salvation
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   and you hear somebody say,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.040]   you're not, God is,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.400]   it can make you feel unstable.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.280]   To replace your sense of self-stability
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.000]   with God's stability
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.880]   requires some Bible knowledge
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.080]   and some prayer and some deep soul work.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.040]   Then you need to go to texts like,
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.720]   those whom he foreknew, he predestined
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.840]   to be conformed to the image of his son,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.760]   that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.040]   And those whom he predestined, he also called.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.560]   And those whom he called, he also justified.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   And those whom he justified, he also glorified.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.720]   Nobody falls out.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.760]   That's why I believe in eternal security.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.360]   Between foreknowledge, predestination,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.880]   calling, justification, and glorification,
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.640]   nobody will be missing, none.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.160]   That's rock solid security and assurance.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   Or, he who began a good work in you
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.960]   will bring it to completion at the day of Christ.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.720]   He will, Philippians 1:6.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   Or, God is faithful.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   He who called you will do it, 1 Corinthians 1:8.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.040]   Or, same thing in 1 Thessalonians.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.200]   He will complete the work he began in you
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.280]   and present you blameless before God.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.080]   Over and over, these statements,
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.520]   you are secure in Christ,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.920]   but your security is totally in the hands of God.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.200]   If God is faithful to you, you will make it.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.360]   If you don't make it, he didn't cause you to make it.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.880]   So that's foundational to what I believe and think.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.960]   Now here's the second piece of it
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.360]   after that massive God piece.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.480]   Alongside those whom he justified, he glorified,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   there is a whole range of commands for us to persevere.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.680]   You don't just have commands like,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.360]   now unto him who is able to keep you from falling
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.560]   and to present you without blemish,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.240]   with joy before the throne of his glory.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.040]   To him be glory and majesty,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.120]   dominion and power forever and ever, amen.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.800]   Jude chapter one, verses 24 and 25.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.160]   Why that tremendous celebration of God's keeping power?
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.840]   It's 'cause I'll never make it.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.360]   I will never make it.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.600]   At 73, I go to my knees almost every day and say,
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.960]   hold on to me.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.800]   The remaining corruption in every human being's soul
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   is enough to make money more precious than God at age 74.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.160]   And 67 years in the faith.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.640]   It is, sin is that powerful
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.280]   if you leave God out of the picture.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.320]   God keeps John Piper and if God doesn't keep me,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.600]   if he takes his hand off me this afternoon,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.480]   I will commit apostasy.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.920]   So it depends on him, not on me.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.480]   Now here come these commands,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.960]   work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.880]   For God is at work in you to will
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.360]   and to work his good pleasure.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.920]   So be about it, Piper.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.560]   Get this book open, get on your knees,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   cry out for keeping and immerse yourself in God's faith,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.880]   comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God every day,
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.600]   not just at the front end of the Christian life.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.400]   If I'm gonna believe, I gotta have word.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.560]   That's how he keeps me.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.480]   Or that passage in Philippians three that I love so much,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.720]   I press on.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.880]   I press on to make it my own
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.680]   because he has made me his own.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.960]   Isn't that great?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.800]   That's the way we think about the Christian life,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.720]   that there's this massive sovereign God
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.160]   who has chosen us before the foundation of the world,
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.960]   who has called us to himself, who will keep us.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.840]   The evidence that that has happened is,
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.160]   are you pressing on?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.720]   Are you pressing on?
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.200]   And then there are the verses that explain
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.760]   the pastors who don't press on.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.360]   They went out from us
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.880]   because they were not of us.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.160]   If they had been of us, they would not have gone out,
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.120]   but they went out that it may be clear
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.000]   that they were not of us.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.400]   I mean, there couldn't be a clearer verse in the Bible
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.200]   on apostasy than 1 John 2,19.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.840]   Or Hebrews 3,14.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.640]   We are in Christ.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.520]   We have shared in Christ.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.920]   If we continue faithful to the end.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.200]   We have shared if we continue.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   Not we will share.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.040]   We have shared if we can continue.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.720]   So I've been thinking recently
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.920]   in view of the present situation,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.920]   I mean, it happens all the time.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.560]   It's not, it's just,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.000]   this one just happens to be a little more public.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.120]   Jesus addressed
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.400]   physical calamities very clearly in Luke 13.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.720]   And I just thought to myself,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.680]   I wonder if it applies properly to spiritual calamities.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.280]   Like apostasy is a calamity.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.640]   Worse than a physical, worse than a tsunami, right?
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   Worse than a shooting in Texas or Ohio
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   is spiritual lostness.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.200]   So here's what Jesus says,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.680]   they come to Jesus and say,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.080]   what about the people that Pilate slaughtered in the temple?
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.760]   And what about the people on whom the tower of Siloam fell?
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   18 innocent people just walking along
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.640]   and the tower fell on them, they all died.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.520]   What do you think about that Jesus?
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.960]   And Jesus' response was amazing.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.360]   He said, you think those people
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.480]   were worse sinners than anybody else.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.520]   Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.840]   Like that's not what we expected you to say.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.040]   And I'm wondering, can you take that text
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.600]   and lay it on top of spiritual calamity?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Somebody comes to me and says,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.040]   have you heard the pastor who committed apostasy?
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.640]   You know, have you heard all those people
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.960]   who were swept away by the Bible,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.720]   the whole teacher or in Jesus' name,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.840]   have you heard about Judas?
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.480]   Do you know what Judas did?
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.560]   Judas has been with us three years.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.520]   He has committed all kinds of beautiful things
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.280]   with his partner in ministry.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.800]   He sent us out two by two.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.520]   Judas healed the sick.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.280]   Judas preached the gospel.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.240]   Did you hear what he just did?
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.280]   There's nothing new here.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.080]   And Jesus, I think, would say,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.520]   you think Judas or any given pastor
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.560]   was a worse sinner than the rest of us?
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.600]   But unless you commit yourself to a life of perseverance
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.960]   and repentance, you too will commit apostasy.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.480]   So that brings us back to my first answer, yes.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.200]   The one other thing I would say,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.560]   and really it's the first thing I thought
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.080]   when I heard this, life is not over.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.680]   - Yes, amen, amen.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.920]   - Life is not over.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.160]   [audience applauding]
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.160]   And the reason that is not just obviously true to me,
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.640]   but poignantly true to me,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.360]   my dad was the youngest of three boys in his family.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.160]   He had a brother named Elmer and a brother named Harold.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.640]   And Bill and Harold, I mean, Bill and Elmer,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.760]   my father and my uncle,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   were lifelong faithful evangelists all the way to the end.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.880]   And Harold made shipwreck at the front end,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.200]   divorced, ruined a lot of things,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.080]   and for, I don't know the exact number,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.760]   but I would say at least 30 years was away from the family.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.280]   I hardly ever saw him.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.000]   Saw Elmer all the time, not Uncle Harold.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.240]   And in my college days, when my grandfather was dying,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.480]   Harold came back to the Lord.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.280]   It was the happiest day of my father's life, I think.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.480]   And I've got pictures, my wife and I were looking at them
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   the other night, pictures of Bill and Elmer and Harold
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   and a dying father, reconciled.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.800]   It's not over, folks.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.120]   You got a kid, it's not over.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.840]   - It's time to come home.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.680]   - It's time to come home.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.520]   - Amen.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.640]   I mean, the prodigal son is a parable
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.800]   about leaving and returning.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.720]   - Thank you to everyone who turned out
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.080]   for this first APJ Live recording
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.840]   at the Getty Sing Conference in Nashville.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   Apparently it went so well,
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.160]   we're gonna do it again in Louisville
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.840]   at the Together for the Gospel Conference
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.160]   in a breakout session on April 15th of next year
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.000]   at 3.30 to 4.30 p.m.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.800]   Maybe we'll see some of you there in person.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.200]   That's April 15th, 3.30 to 4.30 p.m. in Louisville
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.760]   at the Together for the Gospel Conference in 2020.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.640]   Speaking of heavy issues, we go from this to Friday,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.640]   a national holiday in the States.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.320]   It's National Coming Out Day.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.400]   Did the Apostle Paul foreshadow a culture-wide celebration
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.680]   of sexual sin like this?
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   That's the question on Friday.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.640]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.080]   (whooshing)
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
