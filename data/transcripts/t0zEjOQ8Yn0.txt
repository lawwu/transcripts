[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.540]   Josh from Duluth writes in to ask a very common question that we get almost every
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.000]   day through email and is this, "Pastor John, how do I know if I'm saved?"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Josh, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. Acts 16 31.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.500]   "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:42.000]   believes in him will not perish but have eternal life." John 3 16. Romans 3 28.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   "We hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   The whole book of John according to chapter 20 verse 31 is written so that you might
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   believe that Jesus is the Son of God and have believing have life in his name.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So the unmistakable message all through the New Testament is we are saved by
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   believing on Jesus. So rivet your attention on Christ in the Gospels, John,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, the whole Bible. Rivet your attention on Christ and say what you
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   see. If we confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and say what you feel
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   about this. I receive him. I love him. He's my God. He's my Lord. He's my
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   treasure. Confess that. Let yourself hear yourself saying that. Say that to others.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Say it to your wife. Say it to your kids. Say it to your friend. Jesus is my Lord.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   The Bible says no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. Isn't that
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   amazing? Nobody can say Jesus is Lord. So if you say it and mean it, God's at work
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   in your life. You have the Holy Spirit. So what is faith? This believing. John 1 12.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   He came to his own. His own did not receive him, but to as many as received him who
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   believed on his name. So receiving and believing are mutually interpreting. And
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   receiving means when he offers himself to you as a Savior, as a Lord, as a
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   treasure, as a counselor, you receive him. You don't reject him. You receive all
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   that God is for you in Christ. And so receiving is a welcoming and embracing.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Jesus said, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall not hunger.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Whoever believes in me shall never thirst." So believing is a coming to him to have
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   your thirst satisfied. Or it's a receiving of the waterfall of grace that's pouring
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   out of the crevice of the cross and receiving it as the soul hunger satisfyer.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ. So what we see when he
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   opens our eyes is Christ is glorious. Christ is the image of God. Christ is the
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   greatest person that ever was. The greatest Savior, the greatest Lord, the
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   greatest teacher, the greatest counselor, the greatest friend. That's what faith
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   receives from Christ in believing. Now maybe the person who asked this question
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   was thinking about all the passages that talk about the tests of faith in our
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   lives. And we can talk about that maybe more detail another time, but I would
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   just say 1 John is written to give lots of those tests, but they all come
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   down to this. Is your life reflecting the preciousness of Christ that you have
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   received as your Savior? It's not the fruit that justifies you. The tree of
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   faith is the good tree. The fruit is the evidence that the tree is good. And when
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   we're talking about good here, we don't mean perfection. I think a lot of people
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   probably struggle with, "Am I saved?" because they have unrealistic
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   understandings of Christian growth and how sin works. So let me end there maybe
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   by saying in 1 John 1, it goes like this, "If we walk in the light," this is
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   verse 7, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   one another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin." So walking in
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   the light is essential. The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin if we
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   walk in the light. Well, does that mean that walking in the light is perfection?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Well, it can't because there wouldn't be any sins to cleanse. So walking in the
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   light must be something else. So we keep reading, "If we say we have no sin, we
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   deceive ourselves." In other words, we're not walking in the light. In the light,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   you don't get deceived. In the light, you see. What do you see? You see the sin you
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   just committed. And what do you do with it? Verse 9, "If we confess our sins, he's
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So walking in the light might sound to people like, "Oh shoot, I can't walk in
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   the light. I can't keep from sinning." No, that's not what walking in the light
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   means. Walking in the light means that the gospel is so plain to you, the
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   holiness of God is so plain to you, the terribleness of sin is so plain to you
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   that when you stumble into sin, your reaction is, "I hate this. I am sorry,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Father. Please forgive me." You confess it, you receive forgiveness, and you press on
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   with the Lord whose treasure is bigger because of the grace that He's offered to
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   you. So I would just say, "Josh, in the end, the assurance of salvation is a gift
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   from the Holy Spirit." Romans 8, 15, "You have received the Spirit of adoption by
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   whom you cry, 'Abba, Father,' the Spirit Himself bearing witness with your spirit
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   that you are a child of God." When you cry out, "Abba, Father, Jesus, Lord," that's the
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Holy Spirit testifying with your spirit that you are the child of God. So ask Him
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   for that gift. Ask Him for the gift of His own personal testimony that you are His.
