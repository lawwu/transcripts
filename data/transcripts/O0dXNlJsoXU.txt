[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.960]   the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter, reading the eighth verse.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.640]   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.000]   whence it cometh and whither it goeth.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.800]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.760]   We are considering this great and all-important and vital statement that our Lord and Savior
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.840]   made to this man Nicodemus, this ruler of the Jews, who came to him by night, seeking
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.560]   obviously to know from him what it was that he had got to do in order that he might advance
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.040]   to the position which our Lord so clearly occupied.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.120]   But our Lord teaches him, as we have been seeing, that his whole understanding of these
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.400]   matters is entirely wrong.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.360]   He goes on to show him the same thing he later has to tell him as Moses lifted up the serpent
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.400]   in the wilderness.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.440]   Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.920]   perish but have eternal life.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.080]   No man saves himself by his works, by his life, by his actions.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.400]   The Son of Man had to be lifted up, to be crucified on a tree, and to die and be buried
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.160]   and rose again before any man could be pardoned and be saved from perishing.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.120]   But we are particularly concentrating at the present time on what results after that.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.000]   The first thing we all need is to be reconciled with God, and that was the primary work of
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.920]   our Lord.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.880]   He came to keep the law for us, to satisfy the demands of God's holy law.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.000]   But that was not merely a matter of active, positive obedience.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.400]   It necessitated also his bearing on our behalf the punishment of the law, and there we see
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   his passive obedience on the cross, how he was led as a lamb to the slaughter and nailed
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   to the tree.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.840]   His body was broken, his blood was shed.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.040]   He had to be lifted up, must be.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.680]   There is no salvation apart from Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.080]   It is the only way of salvation.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.680]   There is no reconciliation between men and God, or between men and men, apart from this
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.640]   mighty act that took place on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.720]   But thank God it did not stop merely at reconciliation and pardon and forgiveness, vital and essential
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.160]   as they are, as preliminaries, as basis, foundation.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.480]   On that he gives us life, and that is the thing we are considering.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.400]   That is the thing he is telling Nicodemus here, except a man be born again cannot see
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.560]   the kingdom of God.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.160]   Natural ability, human understanding in this realm is valueless completely.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.560]   Indeed it can be a great hindrance, because we all tend to trust to it.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.400]   Passion is of no value, morality is of no value, nothing is of any value.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.720]   He must be born again, born of the Spirit.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   And so we are looking at the characteristics of this life which he came to give us.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.960]   He died not only that we might be forgiven, he died to make us good, and he died to give
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   us life.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.800]   He says that, "I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.960]   abundantly."
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   This is the great New Testament message, and what we are trying to do is to make sure that
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.840]   we are possessors of this life.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.480]   This is the thing that matters, that we have received this life anew, that we have been
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.120]   born again and born of the Spirit.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.960]   And we have seen that in the Scriptures there are many, many tests given to us whereby we
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.000]   may know for certain that we really are the children of God, and the heirs of God, and
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.520]   joint heirs with Christ.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520]   There are many, many tests.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.760]   We have been looking at a large number.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.920]   We have arrived at the point now at which we are dealing with our sense of communion
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.320]   with the three blessed persons in the Holy Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.680]   Spirit.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.960]   The Christian doesn't merely believe things about God.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.760]   He is one who, because of new life and because he's been adopted into God's family, is
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.000]   a child of God and has a knowledge of God, a personal knowledge of God.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.600]   And we are dealing in particular at the moment with our communion with the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.520]   Communion of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.680]   Here is a test.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   If we know anything about this, we are children of God.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.480]   All that the sinner, the unbeliever, knows of the Holy Spirit is his convicting power,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   and it's terrifying.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.880]   He doesn't know communion, fellowship.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.640]   And that we've seen means certain things.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.120]   It means that we have been delivered from what the Apostle Paul calls in Romans 8.15
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.640]   the spirit of bondage, again to fear.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.520]   The Christian is delivered from a spirit of bondage.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.440]   If we are still under the law, we are in bondage.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.800]   If we are still trying to make ourselves Christians, we are under bondage.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.240]   If we are trying to work up our own righteousness, that is the spirit of heaviness and of bondage.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.920]   You'll never find peace, never find satisfaction along that line.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.880]   But the Christian is one who, as we are reminded in Romans 8.2, can say this, "The law of
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.000]   the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.600]   Spirit of bondage is God.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.320]   Not only that, he's aware of peace with God.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.840]   And we ended last Sunday morning by saying that he has within him what the Apostle calls
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.760]   the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.840]   He has not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but he has received the spirit
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.720]   of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.200]   Cry with this elemental heart cry, the little child who doesn't understand human relationships,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.360]   but who knows the father or the mother and cries out after them in his need and in his
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.920]   agony and in his trouble.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.200]   Now this, as we've seen, is a fundamental test, the spirit of adoption.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.560]   The devil can never counterfeit that.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.400]   He can counterfeit many things.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.760]   He can counterfeit peace, but he'll never counterfeit the spirit of adoption.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.440]   But now we move on to another great test, and it follows logically from that last one.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.840]   And that is, of course, the spirit, bearing witness with our spirit.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   This is all, you see, a part of assurance, assurance of salvation.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.440]   Assurance of salvation is, of course, assurance of the fact that you're born again.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   You know.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.240]   You're not just hoping, you know.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.880]   And that is the position in which all Christian people should be.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.120]   John writes this same man, writes his letter when he was an old man, the first epistle,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.520]   and he says, "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.720]   of God, that ye might know that ye have eternal life."
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.840]   My friends, we are meant to know it.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.280]   We are meant to enjoy it while we are still in this world.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.840]   Anything short of that is really the spirit of bondage.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.200]   And that is, we perhaps ought to remind ourselves very forcibly in these days and more and more,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.040]   that is the spirit of Catholicism.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.800]   It's a spirit of bondage.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.960]   Catholicism doesn't believe in assurance.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   You'll never be sure.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.560]   That's why people have to pray for you even when you're dead, and pay money for indulgences
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.120]   and to light candles.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:39.440]   Catholicism and all forms of Catholicism are opposed to the teaching of assurance, obviously,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.760]   because the whole priesthood system depends upon an absence of assurance.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.240]   You need them in life, you need them in death, you need them always.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.760]   In purgatory, you're never sure.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's the antithesis of the New Testament teaching.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.480]   We are meant to have assurance and knowledge and certainty still in this world.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:07.360]   Very well, and so you see the teaching is that not only do we have this filial spirit
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.800]   within us which cries out ever farther, but over and above that, we have the spirit bearing
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.040]   witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.760]   In other words, Romans 8 16 follows Romans 8 15.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   He has not received the spirit of bondage against a fear, but he has received the spirit
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.280]   of adoption whereby we cry ever farther.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:39.240]   The spirit itself or the spirit himself also, beareth witness with our spirits that we are
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.320]   the children of God.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:47.560]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.520]   That's New Testament Christianity.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:58.560]   No fear, no bondage, but there's great assurance confirmed by the testimony and the witness
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.600]   of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:07.360]   Now this I have often described in this pulpit as the highest form of assurance.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.280]   I've dealt with it so frequently that I'm not going to do so again.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.000]   There are many of you here who remember how we worked through this in great detail, but
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.680]   what it means in its essence is this.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:27.560]   The spirit bearing witness with our spirits means that quite apart from all we feel and
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:34.520]   all that we can deduce from the scriptures, there is an immediate and a direct witness
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.880]   given to us by the Holy Ghost.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.480]   Now another way, if you like, of looking at that selfsame thing is the way the apostle
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.920]   puts it in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans and in verse five, where he
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:54.720]   puts it like this, "Hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.240]   our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.040]   Now people often misunderstand that statement.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.920]   They think the love of God shed abroad in our hearts is our love to God.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.120]   It isn't.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.120]   It is God's love to us.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.880]   The love of God shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   What does it mean?
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:24.440]   Well it means this, you see, that we are given this assurance by the Spirit that God loves
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:31.720]   us, that we are his children, that our sins are forgiven.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   That's the thing.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.520]   And there is nothing on earth, there is nothing I imagine in heaven that is higher than this,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.840]   than the knowledge that God has set his heart upon us, that God loves us.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.920]   The love of God to us shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   All the clouds have dissipated and vanished, all uncertainty is gone and we are just there
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   amazed and astonished at the fact that God not only loves us but has troubled even to
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   tell us so.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   How does he do so?
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:09.840]   Well I say the great characteristic of this is that it is something immediate and direct.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.140]   It isn't our action.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:17.440]   You can get assurance by reading your scriptures and looking at what they tell you.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.960]   There are several of them in this third chapter of John's Gospel later on.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.240]   God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   might be saved.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.680]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.100]   because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.120]   If you truly believe therefore, here is your assurance, but you don't stop at that.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.480]   You will have this filial spirit, spirit of adoption, over on top of it all, sealing it
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.080]   all, guaranteeing it all.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:56.160]   The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.560]   Now, sometimes he may do this through a word of scripture.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.480]   Let's be clear about these things.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.840]   You needn't have a vision.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.640]   Very few people have had visions, and you should always be very careful when you feel
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.120]   that you've had a vision.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:22.280]   The devil can counterfeit visions, so don't seek visions or something, hearing an audible
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.000]   sound or an audible word, it doesn't mean that.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.600]   What it means essentially is an impression upon the Spirit.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.960]   The Spirit acts upon our spirits.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.160]   He beareth witness with our spirits, and it is an impression which he makes upon the Spirit
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   which is absolutely certain, stronger than any evidence that we can ever see.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.960]   And it's a disassurance that we are the children of God.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.280]   But I say he may do it through the word.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.160]   He may take a word of scripture one day and bring it right out, and you've never seen
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.440]   it before you feel, and it's speaking to you, "Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.160]   Thou art my child."
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.840]   Well, I've given you great evidence from time to time from the writings of saints and
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.000]   martyrs and confessors throughout the centuries testifying to this.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.960]   Thank God it is something that God's people are still privileged to know.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.720]   It is this sense of the glory of God, that which we considered when we were dealing with
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.100]   the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.800]   This is the highest gift in the baptism of the Spirit, far and away above any particular
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.240]   gifts you may receive.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.080]   This is the highest thing of all, that he is speaking directly to you and telling you
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.140]   that you are his child.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.360]   That is the supreme thing about the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.160]   It is the highest form of assurance.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.760]   It may be accompanied by gifts, it may not be.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.680]   But what matters above everything else is this certainty, this assurance that makes
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.440]   one a living witness, and gives one power to witness and to testify to him and to the
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.760]   word of his grace.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:15.120]   Now another point I would make before we leave this is that it's important we should remember
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.440]   and realize that this is not just some vague feeling of happiness.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.960]   It's beyond a vague feeling of happiness.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.760]   We've known, many of us, all of us probably I trust, what it is to have a vague feeling
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.880]   of happiness in a service such as this, or at other times perhaps on our own.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.480]   That's all right, and that is God-given often, not always remember.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.360]   That's something the devil can counterfeit up to a point, but this is something that
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.800]   the devil cannot counterfeit and would never desire to counterfeit.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.000]   This is beyond, I say, a vague feeling of happiness.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.440]   It is this specific matter of God making his love known to us in this direct, immediate
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440]   manner.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.800]   It's not general, it's not vague, but it's specific.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.940]   He is addressing us as our Father, and he is making known to us that we are his children.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:18.340]   This is something, as many have testified in their accounts of it and in their autobiographies,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.840]   it is something that in a sense cannot be put into words.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   You remember that D.L.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.800]   Moody used to say that he very rarely referred to this great experience when it came to him
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.560]   and afterwards because there was something so sacred about it, and something that almost
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.360]   baffled description.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:43.140]   It is of course comparable in a lesser degree to the experience that the Apostle Paul describes
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.660]   as having had himself when he was lifted up into the third heavens and heard things that
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.220]   couldn't be repeated, couldn't be described.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.080]   It is a touch of heaven, and language is inadequate to describe a touch of heaven.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.820]   You know it, and you know it more certainly than anything that's ever happened to you,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.780]   but it's extremely difficult to put it into words.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:10.220]   The love of Jesus, what it is, none but his loved ones know, and they have always found
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.220]   it difficult to describe it.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:19.540]   They can but humbly testify to the fact that God in his infinite love and mercy and compassion
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.180]   has been pleased to grant it unto them.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:28.180]   That's the testimony of the Spirit with our spirits.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.620]   That is what I call the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.940]   That is what I mean by the sealing with the Spirit.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.300]   It is that which is given to the children to assure them that whatever may happen to
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:46.820]   them in this world, they are the children of God, and therefore they are joined as with
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.820]   Christ.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:59.020]   Now I say here is a realm of course in which the man who's just religious never enters,
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.380]   he knows nothing about it, nothing at all.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:09.020]   Oh, the man who's just religious is of all men the one to be most pitied, because he's
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:15.220]   concerned about these things, and yet he is robbing himself of their real and essential
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.220]   glory.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.140]   There's nothing more tragic and pathetic than the man who's trying to live the Christian
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.620]   life himself, trying to make himself a Christian, and who believes that he has done so, and
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.060]   that he is doing so.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.400]   That is the greatest tragedy of all, this Nicodemus type of person.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.260]   They never know anything about things like this.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:41.980]   They never know anything in reality, in experience of the spiritual realm.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:49.460]   Always dwelling in the realm of moralities and their own activities, and robbing themselves
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:55.580]   in their self-righteousness of the highest blessing that God gives to a human being in
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.580]   this world of time.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.500]   Very well, we must leave it at that.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.340]   As I say, we've been into it, and been into it with great thoroughness before.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:09.900]   But now I want to show you some of the things that result from this great assurance in all
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.860]   its forms.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:19.260]   And these results of course are quite inevitable, but they provide us with very valuable tests
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:25.180]   whereby we can examine and prove ourselves as to whether we are in the faith or not.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:31.020]   My dear people, let me put it to you like this, on this Palm Sunday morning, as we think
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:38.740]   of our blessed Lord going deliberately to Jerusalem and to his death, going to be crucified.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:45.340]   And he did it, I say, in order that we might have this great enjoyment of this blessing.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.180]   And you know, the best way to thank him for what he did and suffered on your behalf is
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.540]   to enjoy these things that he's given you.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.740]   Pity him, pity yourself that you don't know the blessings that he's brought for you in
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.220]   a more thorough manner.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.060]   That's why I'm stressing all this.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:12.220]   Now here, I say again, are things which are invaluable as tests, because they are absolute
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:18.180]   proofs of the fact that we are born again, that we have received this new life, that
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.260]   we are born of the Spirit.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.260]   What are they?
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:27.540]   Love, rejoicing, spirit of rejoicing.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.300]   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:40.820]   Now this is something that runs right through the whole of the New Testament.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:49.260]   You remember how Peter puts it, "Whom having not seen, ye love.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:59.860]   In whom though now ye see him not yet believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.860]   of glory."
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:07.140]   Now that's Peter, writing in his first epistle, in the first chapter of the eighth verse,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.860]   to most ordinary Christian people.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.140]   He doesn't even know their names.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:17.780]   He has to address them as strangers scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.300]   Asia, Bithynia, and so on.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   He doesn't know them.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.460]   He's not writing a circular letter to apostles.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:29.900]   He's writing to unknown, ordinary Christians, and he says, "I know this about you, that
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:37.380]   you are rejoicing in him with a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:44.620]   Glorious, something, as I believe it was Philip Doddridge interpreting that verse, put it,
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.340]   "a joy unspeakable and full of glory," he says, "it means that there is a touch
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.980]   of the glory of heaven upon you, a joy."
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:58.420]   It is a bit of the joy that the blessed spirits in glory are privileged to know.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:06.460]   Now, there, you see, is something that Peter assumes about these Christian people, and
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:12.100]   it is something, of course, that results from this love of God being shed abroad in our
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.100]   hearts.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.740]   They all say the same thing.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:21.060]   The apostle Paul, you remember, in his Philippian epistle in particular, keeps on saying this,
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.500]   "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord."
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.860]   He says that in the third chapter, in the first verse.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.100]   Go on to the fourth chapter, the fourth verse.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.700]   Here it is again, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.700]   And again I say, "Rejoice."
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.780]   Here it is.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.780]   You see, it is the great note of the New Testament scriptures.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   John writes his last letter, as I've reminded you, as an old man, and he tells us why he
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.780]   writes it.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.360]   You see, he knows he is going to die and he is leaving these people.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.980]   This is why he writes these things, "Rightly unto you, that your joy may be full."
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.420]   Full!
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.820]   Why did our Lord die for us?
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.820]   Is it to make us miserable?
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.580]   Some people give the impression that the main effect upon them of their being Christians
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.380]   is that they are miserable.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.940]   You see, they seem to know enough about these things to spoil everything else for them,
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.020]   but they've got no positive joy.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.820]   If what you have is something that makes you unhappy and miserable and just robs you of
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.460]   things and you feel you are always making great sacrifices, my dear friend, you know
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.660]   nothing about it.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.620]   Your joy is meant to be full.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:40.980]   It's meant to be a positive joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:47.700]   Well, this is something again that the world and the devil can never counterfeit.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.580]   Religion can never produce this.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.820]   Religion never makes people happy.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:56.180]   And it's one of the best ways of differentiating between religion and Christianity.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.820]   Religion is always a task, it's a burden.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.060]   And it's a knowledge of God that makes one fear.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.820]   Religion always depresses, always makes unhappy.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:14.540]   That is why I say we must be careful lest we be led back into some organized institutional
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:22.860]   religion which keeps people priest-ridden and depressed and in the fear of God alone,
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.340]   in a wrong sense, a craven fear.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.780]   When Martin Luther understood in a flash the doctrine of justification by faith, he began
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.260]   to sing.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.500]   He was filled with a sense of joy.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.700]   This is New Testament Christianity.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.700]   The other isn't.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.700]   It's religion.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:47.980]   It's a conglomeration of Old Testament religion and mystery religions and paganism all amalgamated
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.820]   into a horrible system.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.740]   And it's the very antithesis of Christianity.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:59.580]   It is indeed, to use the phrase of John the Antichrist, there is no question about it,
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:05.660]   a miserable, wretched religion that robs people of a true joy.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:11.180]   Of course there have been cases, and thank God for them, even amongst such people where
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.380]   God has visited a soul and given them this great experience.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.660]   There are saints and mystics amongst them who have known this joy, but it's been in
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:25.220]   spite of the system, and they've generally been persecuted by the system and by the authorities
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.420]   that control the system.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.580]   No, no, religion can never give this.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:38.820]   This is the very essence of this new life which is in Christ Jesus, this being born
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.500]   of the Spirit.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.540]   But let me put this to you in its fullness.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:53.940]   I've already quoted Peter to you in his first epistle, and I must complete my quotation
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.380]   because it's important that we should understand fully what he says.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.780]   I quoted the eighth verse to you, but this is how Peter puts it, remember.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.900]   He says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.100]   his abundant mercy hath begotten us again," and that's being born again, "and to a lively
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.940]   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:25.020]   undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved in him for you, who are kept by the power
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.540]   of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time."
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:39.900]   But listen to this, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.300]   in heaviness through many full temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.620]   precious than of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.620]   praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ."
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.620]   What a combination.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:01.820]   "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.420]   through many full temptations."
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.140]   That's Peter.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.020]   But listen to Paul saying the same thing.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.340]   In Romans 5, "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:20.940]   Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have accessed by faith into this grace wherein we stand,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.740]   and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.300]   Seeing the glory and being in it.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:40.940]   But then he adds, "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.900]   tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:52.820]   maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.020]   which is given unto us."
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:59.260]   But here's the phrase, "Not only so, we not only rejoice in hope of the glory of God,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:04.900]   we do so," says Paul, "in the midst of tribulations."
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:10.460]   When everything is going against us, when circumstances are mocking us and jeering at
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.620]   us and playing with us, when all the enemies seem to have risen against us, when hell seems
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:22.540]   to have been let loose round and about us, in tribulations, we rejoice in the midst of
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.620]   them.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.500]   Not merely in spite of them, we're rejoicing in the midst of them.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.900]   Did you notice that extraordinary logic?
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:35.220]   We see the value of these things, "Not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing,"
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.420]   we know this, "that tribulation worketh patience."
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.340]   The sort of Christian, you know, who looks back to his conversion constantly and is always
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.900]   talking about that, seems to me to be utterly unscriptural.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.940]   The Christian life is a life that grows and develops and becomes more wonderful as you
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.940]   go on.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:58.300]   People say, "Oh, that I might have again that first flush of joy."
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.260]   My dear friend, if your joy isn't greater now than when you first believe there's something
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.340]   radically wrong with you, we need to be taught, "Knowing that tribulation worketh patience
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:14.020]   and patience worketh experience and experience leads to hope.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.660]   Hope maketh not ashamed of cross that."
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:24.540]   And so you see, the rejoicing that the Christian knows, the man who is the child of God, is
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.940]   a rejoicing that never fails you.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.060]   Now that's, you see, how to differentiate between the true and the counterfeit.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:39.100]   Oh, there are people who have this artifact, this kind of manufactured joy.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.300]   It can be worked up.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   The psychologists know how to do this, and the psychologists in public meetings often
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.860]   know how to do this.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:51.020]   And they work people up with hymns and choruses and various other forms of manipulation, and
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.060]   people think they're filled with this joy.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.500]   I can tell you how to discover the difference between the true and the false.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.620]   False joy goes out through the window the moment you're in trouble.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.060]   It's a farewell, a friend.
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:11.260]   But when the tribulations come, when the trials come, you're utterly cast down, your joy
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:16.820]   is gone, all your happiness has disappeared, and you're grumbling and complaining and
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.160]   wondering why God is dealing with you like this.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.540]   You had a false joy.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:30.820]   The true joy is the joy of the child, and he rejoices in tribulations, in the midst
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:36.180]   of them, in the depth and the height of them, whatever's happening to him.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:42.780]   Rejoice evermore, rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:51.620]   And again I say, rejoice, whatever the circumstances and the conditions.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:58.260]   Very well, there is then a very valuable test, if you know what it is, when everything has
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:04.820]   gone against you, still, to have a spirit of rejoicing within you, in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.820]   It is in him, of course.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.820]   It isn't vague.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.020]   Let me go on repeating this.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.420]   This is never something vague and general.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.500]   The apostle again has defined it for us.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   We are the circumcision.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   Who are we?
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.540]   Well, he says the test of whether a man is a true Christian or not is this.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:31.060]   We worship God in the spirit, we rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.060]   flesh.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:41.300]   A Christian is a man who in all circumstances says, "In the cross of Christ I glory.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:47.940]   God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of my Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.020]   So whatever his circumstances are, however great the tribulations, he goes on rejoicing,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:32:00.420]   because he's rejoicing in the Lord Jesus Christ, in his cross, in everything that appertains
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.460]   to him.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:10.380]   And it is a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:17.700]   It is a joy, if I may adapt the words of Wordsworth, and lift them up into infinity, that is too
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   deep for tears.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.180]   That's the joy we are describing, rejoicing, joy and rejoicing.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:31.340]   And then of course the thing that follows immediately from that is praise and thanksgiving.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.060]   Here's another wonderful test.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:40.300]   Praise and thanksgiving, what a characteristic of the true Christian are we.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.340]   And we must test ourselves, my dear friends, by these things.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:48.460]   This is something that is universal in the New Testament.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:54.300]   And again it is one of those things that can never be counterfeited.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.220]   Now praise and thanksgiving, that doesn't just mean singing hymns that you like, and
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.380]   being carried away by the typhoon.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.740]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:09.840]   I'm talking about a praise and a thanksgiving whirling up from the very depths of our hearts.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.460]   You see, you get to the beginnings of this even in the Old Testament.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:21.580]   The Old Testament saints were aware of all these things in a measure, but only in a measure.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.100]   They never enjoyed the fullness.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:29.220]   The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified, as John puts it there
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.580]   in the seventh chapter of his Gospel in verses 38 and 39.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.180]   But they knew something about it.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.760]   Listen to the psalmist, "Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.000]   corn and their wine increased."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.440]   The time of harvest was a very happy time for the farmer, and they were always happy
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.340]   and they had their feast and their wine and their rejoicing.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.000]   It was the highest moment of the year for them.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.360]   All the labor was now giving its returns, the fruit was being gathered in, and they
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.720]   could face the winter.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.440]   And it was a time of great rejoicing.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:10.560]   Listen to the psalmist, "Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.760]   corn and their wine increased."
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.800]   That's the thing.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.960]   And you get many other similar expressions of it in the Old Testament Scriptures.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.560]   But of course, when you come to the new and after the day of Pentecost, then you see this
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.840]   coming out in all its fullness.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.540]   You see, it begins at once.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.920]   You begin to read about the early church in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.600]   second chapter, and this is the note that hits you and strikes you immediately.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:48.320]   "Then they that gladly received his word, the word of Peter, were baptized.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.080]   And the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls."
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.440]   It was a dangerous thing to be a Christian in those days.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.120]   It would mean persecution from your fellow Jews, ostracism from the family, and so on.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   But here it is.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.760]   Then go on, let's read again.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.840]   Read the story that follows.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.700]   and in prayers.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.720]   And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.560]   And all that believed were together and had all things common, and sold their possessions
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.200]   and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need."
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.320]   Listen, "And they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:42.160]   house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.440]   having favor with all the people.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.320]   And the Lord added to the church daily such as should believe."
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.480]   That's Christianity.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.800]   That's the Christian church.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.640]   A rejoicing, a praising church.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.840]   A church that is filled with thanksgiving.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.760]   Now, it started like that and it continued like that.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.520]   I read to you just now that introduction to the first epistle of Peter.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.000]   Remember how he bursts out, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord and Savior,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.400]   Jesus Christ."
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.720]   Read these epistles, watch the introductions, and immediately you'll find them starting
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.320]   off with this praise, thanksgiving, magnifying the grace and the glory of God.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.920]   They're a thankful people.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.560]   Why, of course, there's no need to argue about this, is there?
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.880]   How can a man be a Christian without being thankful and grateful?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   What is a Christian?
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:44.360]   Well, a Christian, if you like, is a man who knows that he is what he is by the grace of
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.320]   God.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.000]   His sins are forgiven.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.560]   Why are they forgiven?
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.960]   Is it because of his good life?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.460]   Is it because of his religious duties?
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.040]   Is it because of the gifts he gives to others?
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.840]   No, no, that's religion.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:09.960]   The Christian is a man who knows that he owes everything to the grace of God in our Lord
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.920]   and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.040]   He's received it as a free gift.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.880]   He knows that he is what he is, has had his forgiveness, his new life, his everything,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:26.040]   because the Son of God gave himself for him on the cross on Calvary's Hill, and endured
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:31.240]   the shame, the suffering, the agony of it all, in order that he might be forgiven and
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.720]   might become the child of God.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.560]   Now, if you can believe a thing like that and not feel grateful and thankful, well,
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.160]   then I don't understand you.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.120]   It's impossible.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.940]   If there is no thankfulness, there is no value in the belief.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.680]   It must be purely intellectual.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.080]   When a human being does you a kindness, how careful you are to thank him.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.400]   You'll write a letter, you'll go and see them, every time you meet them, you thank
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.000]   them, you pour out your thanksgiving upon them for what they've done for you.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.360]   And of course, it's right.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.800]   But my dear friends, look at this, look what he's done for us.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:10.520]   The Son of God has died for us, suffered all that he endured during that week leading up
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:16.240]   to Good Friday from Palm Sunday, and all that you and I might be what we are.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.440]   Thanksgiving, thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.240]   The Apostle Paul can't think of him and mention his name without bursting forth into
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.800]   thanksgiving and into praise and into worship and adoration.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.540]   It's inevitable.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.080]   But the religious man knows nothing about that.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.880]   Everything is somber and dark.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.520]   He's just praying still for strength and forgiveness.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.520]   There's no thanksgiving.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.360]   He doesn't know anything about it.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.840]   Very well, let me end then on this note.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:39:00.120]   And this is again the most wonderful test, resting, resting in God and in his promises
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.080]   and in the great salvation.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:08.360]   It's the other side, if you like, of the rejoicing in tribulations that I mentioned
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   just now.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:15.120]   But it is a very important one, because there are times when we are so hard pressed that
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   our joy is apparently, for the time being, at internet, blunted somewhat.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:29.800]   But you know, there is a depth in joy which shows itself in resting, just resting quietly.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.040]   Again you can't analyze it, you can't explain it, but you know that it is there and that
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.320]   it is true.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.980]   It means this.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:44.520]   That you so know the love of God to you and so know that you are a child of God, that
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:50.440]   even when you don't quite understand what he's doing to you or what he's doing with
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:58.080]   you, you still trust him, you still love him, you leave yourself in his hands.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:05.120]   You'd sooner be in the hands of God in the dark than anywhere else in the midst of blazing
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   light.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.260]   This is, I say, something that only the child of God knows.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.880]   It is this ultimate, final trust.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.480]   Let me put it again to you in the words of the Apostle Paul.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.920]   Here it is in Philippians 4, 6 and 7, "Be careful for nothing, don't be over anxious,"
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   he says, "for anything."
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.440]   It doesn't matter what your circumstances.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.040]   This is an all-inclusive term.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   Be careful for nothing, nothing at all.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:39.640]   But in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:48.120]   known unto God, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:54.040]   hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:59.920]   The peace of God that passeth all understanding.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.880]   Listen to him going on with this, "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.560]   care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were careful, but ye lacked opportunity."
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:18.000]   Not that I speak in respect of want, "For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, there
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.880]   wilt thou be content."
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.960]   I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.320]   Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.680]   abound and to suffer need.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:39.760]   I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.800]   That's it my friend.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.920]   In prison he writes things like that.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:51.440]   "I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therein and therewith to be content."
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:57.800]   Nothing matters to this man except that he knows that all is well between him and God.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:07.520]   So he says, "When peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like sea billows row,
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:18.400]   whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, 'It is well, it is well with my soul, my
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.040]   heart is resting, O my God, I will give thanks and sing.'"
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:37.280]   My heart is resting at the source of every secret and sacred thing.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.600]   That's it.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:45.440]   A heart at rest, at rest from itself, at rest from the world.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:53.120]   A heart that is resting in the Lord, fulfilling in practice the old commandment of the Old
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:43:00.880]   Testament, "Rest in the Lord, wait patiently for him."
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:08.000]   And this child of God is always like that, always ready to do so.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Doesn't understand, but he knows.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.080]   He knows intuitively, instinctively, as only a child can know, he can't prove it in logic,
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.440]   but he knows.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:31.160]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:37.600]   the called according to his purpose.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:47.320]   The poor religious man, he knows nothing about that, and he is devoid of one of the most
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:54.040]   glorious, blessed experiences that can ever come to a human being in this world of sin
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.360]   and shame, of trial and of tribulation.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:09.560]   The peace of God, the passive all-understanding, but which is a glorious reality.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   Amen.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
