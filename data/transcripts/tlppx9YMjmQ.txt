[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   I don't know any economist who doesn't think that a land value tax is an attractive idea,
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.240]   right? And one of the reasons, so the basic idea is we're going to tax land, let's say,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.800]   rather than taxing real estate values. It doesn't create the same disincentive to build
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.720]   that a real estate tax does. A real estate tax says, "Oh, you know what? I might want to keep
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240]   this thing as a parking lot for a couple of years so I don't have to pay taxes on it."
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.000]   If it were a land value tax, you're going to pay the same tax whether or not it's a parking lot
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640]   or whether or not you're going to put a high-rise on it, so you might as well put the high-rise on
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.000]   it and we could use the space. Where George got it wrong is the idea that a land value tax is
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.080]   going to solve all the problems of society or all the problems of cities is ludicrously not true.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.560]   At the national level, it's not a particularly progressive tax in lots of ways. It would be
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.280]   hard to figure out how to fund all the things you want to fund, especially since there are lots of
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.040]   things that we do that are not very land-intensive. I think George was imagining a world in which
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.880]   pretty much all value-creating enterprises had a lot of land engaged. So a good idea? Yes. A panacea?
