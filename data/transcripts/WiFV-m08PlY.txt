[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   A podcast listener named Dan writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, how do I conquer
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.360]   the love of human praise? My heart is so prideful." Well let me say that Dan has
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.240]   already made two key discoveries that I hear in the question. One is that there
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.540]   are two kinds of pride. There's the pride of the strong that praises itself, praises
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.600]   himself, and there's the pride of the weak that craves other people to praise
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.880]   me. And the other discovery that Dan has made is that he's more guilty of the
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:53.000]   second than the first. And I say more guilty because all of us are guilty of
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.080]   both. Everybody draws attention to himself at some time and brags, and
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.120]   everybody wants other people to notice when we we do something. It tastes good
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.680]   to be affirmed and praised. So this is a universal question. He's not unique. And
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.920]   it is amazing to me how directly Jesus addresses this issue in the Sermon on
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.680]   the Mount. Listen to this. Matthew 6 to 2, "When you give to the needy, sound no
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.520]   trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogue and in the streets, that
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.520]   they may be praised by others. Truly I say to you, they have received their
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.880]   reward." In verse 5, "When you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.680]   love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.240]   be seen by others. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward." Verse 16,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   "When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   faces, that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly I say to you, they have
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.760]   received their reward." So Jesus is amazingly aware of this issue, and he's
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.800]   got much to say about it. In those three statements, verse 2, verse 5, verse 16, in
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.940]   Matthew 6, in the Sermon on the Mount, there are three incentives to help us
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.500]   hate this disease of praise-seeking. Number one, Jesus calls us hypocrites
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.700]   when we seek the praise of men. When you do something praiseworthy to get the
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.100]   praise of man, you're not doing the praiseworthy thing, you're doing the
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.980]   praise-craving thing. You're a hypocrite. You pretend to do the good, but that is
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.620]   incidental to what you really want, applause. So we fight this craving, first
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.260]   by hating hypocrisy. Everybody hates hypocrisy. "Well, we are one." "Well, you
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.660]   don't want to be one." So don't do that. Second, Jesus says in all three cases of
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.540]   praise-craving, "They have received their reward." What's the point of saying that?
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.660]   Well, I think there are two points of saying that. One, you lose something great, and
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.380]   you gain something pitiful. What do you gain? You gain the praise of man. You want
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380]   it, you get it. That's it. And the connotation is that what you gain is
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.020]   pitiful. It's like a drug. It gives a buzz, it's gone.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.700]   Gotta have another fix. You're always insecure. You're always needy of other
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.380]   people's praise in order for you to be happy or to feel secure. It never satisfies. And so
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.820]   when he says, "You have your reward," he means it's a lousy reward. You're
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.900]   settling for such a little reward. But the other point, this is the third incentive,
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.700]   is what you're losing, the reward of God. So here's Matthew 6, 1. "Beware of
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.260]   practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.620]   for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven." You gain
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.180]   this lousy, pitiful, drug-like reward, and you lose an infinite reward. And it
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.020]   doesn't say what the reward is, but back in chapter 5, verse 12, it says, "Great is
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.060]   your reward in heaven." It's from God, and it is very, very great. So three incentives
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.260]   with which to kill this craving for human praise. One, it makes you a
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.060]   hypocrite. We don't like hypocrites, and so let's not be one. Two, it delivers a
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.220]   pitiful reward. Three, it robs you of a great reward. And Paul, we go beyond Jesus
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.620]   now to Paul, he fleshes out this third incentive. He says in Romans 2, 29, that
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:06.060]   Christians are people whose praise is not from man, but from God. And 2nd
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.660]   Corinthians 10, 18 says, "It's not the one who commends himself who is approved, but
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.380]   the one whom the Lord commends, or praises." So do you want to be praised? Let
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.780]   it come from God. "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.'" C.S.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.020]   Lewis called that "the weight of glory." How can it be that the infinite, perfect
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.980]   God would look upon my imperfect obedience and say, "Well done, good and
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.900]   faithful servant"? How could anything in me be praiseworthy? Of course, the answer
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.340]   is 1st Corinthians 4, 7, "What do you have that you did not receive? And if you
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.260]   received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?" Everything I have is a
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.380]   gift. If God praises anything in me, He's praising His grace in me. So these are
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.180]   some of the truths, and there are a lot more that we need to preach to ourselves
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:14.260]   in order to slay this dragon of craving for the praise of man. That's so good.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.020]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Dan. Tomorrow, Pastor John
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.340]   will answer questions from two different podcast listeners who are both asking
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.180]   the same thing. What to do when an unmarried couple who's living together
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.660]   travels and stays in your home? Should you give them one bed? Should you give them
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.580]   two beds? Or should you even host them together at all? I'm your host Tony
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.380]   Rehnke, we'll see you tomorrow.
