[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   the Gospel according to St. John in the fifth chapter and the forty-fourth verse. The forty-fourth
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:23.080]   verse in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, "How can ye believe which receive
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:33.680]   honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?" How can you believe
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:44.400]   which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.840]   Those who attend here regularly will know that this evening we are looking at this great
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.640]   and momentous statement for the third time. And I come back to it not merely because we
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.240]   have not exhausted its wealth of meaning, but also because, as I have been trying to
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:11.360]   indicate, it is one of those pivotal, vital verses in connection with the Christian faith.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.920]   There is no more important verse than this, because here our Lord, as you see, analyzes
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.000]   the most important question which can ever confront us, namely, belief in him. Now, we
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.600]   have already considered what it is that makes this kind of belief in him impossible. He
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.920]   says there is only one thing that makes belief in him impossible, and that is that we have
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:47.440]   that kind of mentality that simply lives to give and to receive honour one to another.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.680]   That mentality, he says, makes belief in him a sure and an utter impossibility. We have
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.720]   also considered what it is that leads to belief in him. He makes it quite plain. It is to
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:11.120]   seek that honour that comes alone from God. And in both cases, we have been able to find
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.960]   and deduce abundant reasons for the statement which our Lord makes. We have seen why the
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.400]   sort of men who simply live to receive worldly honour, honours from man, cannot possibly
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.200]   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. And we saw last Sunday equally clearly that if a man
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.660]   truly seeks that honour which God alone can give, he will be driven of necessity to believe
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.240]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.200]   Now then, having done that, we are still left with this great and vital question. What is
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.240]   it that accounts for people like these Jews to whom our Lord was speaking, you remember,
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.880]   on this occasion? What accounts for all other people who are in the same group, in the same
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.680]   category? Here was the position, you remember. Our Lord was addressing a body of Jews who
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.760]   did not believe in him, regarded him as but a man, and indeed regarded him as a blasphemer,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.640]   regarded him as one who in his willfulness was breaking God's law by healing on a Sunday.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.120]   And our Lord reasons with them, makes positive statements to them, claims explicitly that
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.320]   he is one with God, sharing the same mind, the same will, the same purpose, that God
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.720]   has given to him power to give life and power to execute judgment. And then he says to them,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.440]   "Well," he says, "I know you won't accept all this because you've got a saying to the
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.680]   effect that in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall everything be established." "Very well,"
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.160]   he says, "I've got my witnesses," and he produced them. John the Baptist, his testimony,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.480]   the miracles, God himself, all the Old Testament, here's the evidence. But still they remained
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:27.520]   obdurate, still they remained impervious to all his arguments and all his appeals. And
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.040]   yet he goes on, he doesn't give them up. Here we see his love shining through gloriously.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.960]   He says, "I receive not testimony from men, but these things I say that you might be saved."
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.240]   And yet there they are still standing back. They don't believe in him. They don't believe
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.000]   his word. They don't accept his claims. They won't submit themselves to him and be blessed
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.840]   by him. He turns to them and says, "You will not come unto me that you might have life."
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.600]   What's the matter with them? Well, here I say he is dealing with that, and he is giving
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.960]   these reasons on the one hand and on the other. And I say the question that arises for us
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:23.240]   now at this point, having analyzed it hitherto, is just this. What is it then in men that
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.080]   makes him seek honor from another man rather than seek that honor that is from God only?
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.120]   That's the question. To do that makes belief impossible. To do that leads to belief. Well,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.320]   what is it then that accounted for the fact that these Jews did not seek the honor that
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.720]   God alone could give, but did seek the honor from one another? What is this? What is it
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.960]   that still accounts for that in men and women? Why is it that men and women do not believe
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.440]   in the Son of God and receive that life which he has come to give? What causes this? Well,
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.840]   the answer is again abundantly plain and clear. It's an answer which is given everywhere in
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:22.640]   the Bible. It's what the Bible calls sin. It's what has happened to men as the result
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:30.320]   of the Fall. This seeking honor one from another and not seeking honor from God is the result
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.880]   of sin and its devastating effect upon men and upon his nature.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.120]   Now, this, as I need scarcely remind you, is one of the central and the basic themes
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.320]   of the whole Bible from beginning to end, and of course it must be. No man is prepared
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   to listen to the voice of a Savior unless he realizes that he is in trouble and that
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.080]   he is in need. And the world doesn't listen to Christ tonight because it doesn't see any
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:09.040]   need of him. It's not aware of its trouble and of its need. So, the Bible puts this in
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:18.080]   the forefront. There are only two great themes in the Bible. One is sin, the other is salvation,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.680]   and they must be taken together. It's inevitable. And therefore, when you read your Bible you'll
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.520]   find that the Old Testament is full of this question, this doctrine of sin. It's an extended
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.960]   account of what sin has done to mankind. The law reveals sin, the prophets revealed sin,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.320]   you find it in the Psalms, it's everywhere. Sin! But it's when you come to the New Testament
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.120]   that you really see it clearly. And that, of course, for this good reason, that here
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.600]   we are confronted at once in the pages of the four Gospels with the greatest tragedy
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   in the whole story of the human race. God's Son came into the world. He came unto his
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:13.280]   own, and his own received him not. Here you see the problem, that when God sends his only
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.080]   begotten Son into the world, and the Son comes and stands before the world and offers salvation,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   the world rejected him and cried out, saying, "Away with him! Crucify him!" Chose a robber
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:34.600]   called Barabbas rather than the Son of God, the Savior. Here you see it in all its utter
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.760]   stark nakedness. What is the matter with the world? What is this thing, I say, in human
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.160]   nature and in the human race that drives it to such an action, and that accounts for such
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:59.440]   an action? And as I say, the answer is everywhere, just this, it is sin.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.560]   And what I want to do with you, therefore, this evening is to analyze that, indeed to
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.920]   put before you our Lord's own analysis of that. As he stood there confronted by those
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.400]   unbelieving Jews, he in effect is saying this to them, "I'll tell you what's the matter
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.520]   with you. You don't believe in me, you won't come unto me that you might have life. Why?
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.760]   Well, because you're in the grip of sin. You are suffering from the effects of this
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.480]   foul canker that entered into life, and into the life of man, and has ruined him." So
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:47.200]   we can treat this verse as our Lord's exposition of what sin has done to man. And I can divide
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:58.760]   up the matter like this very simply. Here is the first thing. Sin, in the last analysis,
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:07.040]   makes man a fool. Oh, you'll find that stated very often in the Bible. "The fool hath said
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:22.280]   in his heart there is no God." The fool. Sin makes man a fool, an utter fool, foolish.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:30.920]   Now, the real trouble, it seems to me, with all modern views of men and his predicament,
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.320]   the real trouble with all these views, every view in fact except that which is found in
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:43.640]   the Bible, the final criticism to offer of them is that they are so utterly superficial.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:51.800]   It isn't merely that they're wrong, I say they are unutterably superficial. What they
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:11:00.040]   don't realise is the essential nature of man's trouble, and especially the depth of
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.640]   his trouble. Is there anything more pathetic and more tragic in the world at this moment
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.040]   than just that? To see the kind of remedies that men and women who are not Christians
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.400]   are offering to the world in its present predicament. They've been doing it for centuries, but
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.600]   they still go on repeating exactly the same thing. Now I say the final thing to say about
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.920]   all these things is that they are so unutterably superficial.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:36.000]   You see, the problem that we've got to solve is this. I put it again. What is it in men
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.360]   that makes him turn his back upon his Saviour? What is it that makes a man reject the Son
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:52.680]   of God and his wondrous offer of salvation? Now that's the thing we've got to explain.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:04.120]   And I say that here is the only adequate explanation that sin makes men a fool.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.700]   In other words, let me put it like this. There are two common misconceptions, it seems to
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.120]   me, in the modern view of men and of men's need and trouble. The first is that which
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:24.320]   assumes that man essentially is right, but there are particular things that are wrong
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.720]   with him. Now you're familiar with that view of men, are you not? The idea is that man
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:38.120]   himself, at the center and in the very core of his being, is all right. It's admitted
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.240]   that there are certain blemishes and defects here and there, but man himself, we are told,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.800]   is all right. He's essentially right, though he may have certain particular things about
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:59.000]   him which are wrong. You see, the Bible says the very exact opposite of that. What the
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.680]   Bible says about men is that his trouble is that he himself is essentially wrong. It grants
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.800]   that he may do many things that are right, that he's capable of nobility and many right
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.960]   actions. Yes, but the trouble is that man himself is wrong. It's the center that's
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:24.880]   wrong. Not certain things on the circumference, but the very heart and center of men has been
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:36.640]   vitiated and ruined by the fall and sin. The second misconception is this one, that sin
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:45.720]   is something which merely affects man's actions and leaves his mind and his brain and his
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:52.840]   understanding intact. Now again, I think that you are familiar with many who say something
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:59.360]   like that at the present time. They say man, of course, himself is all right, his ideas
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.240]   are all right, he fails in practice. Man's trouble, they say, is in the realm of execution.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.320]   They say the real problem of the world is that man will keep on lapsing in this respect
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.960]   and that respect. It's only a question of conduct in particular, certain particular
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:23.520]   actions. He himself is thinking, his mind, his outlook is essentially right. Now again,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:31.120]   the Bible gives a blank denial to that, and says that the essential trouble with men and
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:38.680]   the real tragedy of men is in his mind, it's his outlook that's wrong. It isn't merely
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:48.360]   man's actions, it's that his total view of himself and of life is altogether erroneous.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:15:01.200]   In other words, as I say, the biblical contention is that sin has made man a fool. And this
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:12.720]   folly of his comes out in certain respects, such as these. That men refuses to face facts.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.640]   That men not only refuses to face facts. What do I mean by that? Well, certain facts like
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   this, that life is short and life is fleeting, that this is not the only life. Ah, but you
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.120]   say that's being morbid. No, no, we're not hurling names at one another, are we? I say
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.760]   that the fact of death is a fact, and if you don't start your philosophy by catering for
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:42.480]   who. But man not only doesn't face these facts, he deliberately won't face them, and he deliberately
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.920]   refuses to face them, and he's annoyed with anybody who tries to press him to face them.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   He resents it. He says, "But you shouldn't do that." And yet they're facts. Now I say
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:02.920]   a man who becomes annoyed when he is asked to face facts is just a fool. What would you
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   say of the men who, having been told by his doctor that if he goes on drinking and smoking
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.120]   and overeating as he has been doing, he'll kill himself? Who says, "I take no notice
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.800]   of things like that," and carries on. There's only one thing to say about him, the man's
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:25.520]   a fool. Of course he is. Any man who refuses to face facts is a fool. He's also a fool
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:36.760]   in this respect, that he doesn't think and he doesn't reason clearly. He doesn't really
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.160]   apply his mind to the fundamental problem. Oh, he's very interested in the atomic bomb,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.440]   something always outside his own life, far away from him. But he never sits down and
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.120]   looks at himself in a mirror and talks to himself about himself. He doesn't do that.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.740]   He refuses to think clearly. He'll think very clearly mathematically, scientifically, and
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:02.840]   in many other respects. But when it comes to the whole problem of himself and his life,
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:10.640]   he doesn't think clearly any longer. He doesn't reason carefully. He trusts to intuitions.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.160]   He believes in vague generalizations. Well, now again, surely that is to be guilty of
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:25.400]   folly. You may apply much thought and reason to your business or your profession. I ask
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   you, have you applied the same reason and thought and logic to yourself, your personal
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.720]   life and living, your married life, your family life, your relationships with others, and
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.400]   yourself in the total content of this modern world? And then I put it finally at this point
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:53.520]   in this way, that man, as our Lord here clearly indicates, is governed by his desires and
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.400]   that's why he doesn't use his mind and his brain. "Ah," says man, "I want to enjoy myself.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.360]   I want to have a good time. I'd rather like this honor that other people pay me." So he
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.320]   goes in for that. How can you believe that we receive honor one of another? That's what
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.960]   he lives for. It's pleasant, it's enjoyable, it's marvelous, he says, it's wonderful.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.240]   So he goes in for it. Why? Well, because he likes it. He's governed by his desire. His
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.680]   test is what gives him pleasure. He's a hedonist. This is the thing that comes first. Everything
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:31.480]   is judged in terms of, "Will I be happy? Will I enjoy this?" instead of asking, "Is it right?
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:41.120]   Is it true? Has it got a fundamental righteousness in it?" Well, in those ways, our Lord here
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:49.840]   indicates, it seems to me, that sin has made of men a fool. That's the proposition. "You
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.040]   receive honor," he says, "one of another, and re-seek not the honor that comes from
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.920]   God only." And there's only one thing to say about a man of whom that is true. He's a fool.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.880]   Now I've given it to you in a kind of intellectual form. Let me give it to you in the practical
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.840]   form. Can this charge which our Lord makes against a man who doesn't believe in him,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.000]   can it be substantiated? Is it a harsh judgment? Or is it true? Very well, let me deal with
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.240]   that in a second proposition by showing the way in which this folly that results from
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:37.680]   sin reveals and manifests itself. How does it do so? Well, here are the ways in which
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:52.960]   it does so. This folly leads the men to put man before God. Now, you see, he goes wrong
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.640]   at the very beginning, doesn't he? Man, as our Lord has proved, and as we've seen together,
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.520]   is a man who's always out for honor. He always wants to be honored by somebody, man or God.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.120]   Well, now, the man who doesn't believe in Jesus Christ is the man who seeks honor from
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.680]   men, and doesn't seek it from God. So there, I say, he goes astray. Who does he seek honor
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:22.040]   from? And there he reveals himself to be a fool. He seeks it from man, and does not seek
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:31.440]   it from God. He puts man before God. Now, isn't this unutterable folly? The way you
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:39.000]   test the value of an honor is to discover, is it not, the source of the honor? Let me
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.560]   give you but a passing obvious illustration. You may see on a piece of paper a man's name
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.000]   with a number of degrees following. "Oh," you say, "this is very wonderful. Look at
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.040]   these degrees that this man has got. This must be a great man." But then a friend comes
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:02.240]   along and says, very rightly, "Yes, that's all right. It looks very imposing and very
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:13.080]   impressive. But where did he obtain these degrees? From which university has he received
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:20.680]   them? There are degrees and degrees. A man may have had his high degree from Oxford or
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:29.040]   Cambridge or Harvard or Princeton or Yale. Yes, let me put it simply and plainly. But
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.840]   a man may have the same degrees after his name, but he's obtained them from the University
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:46.240]   of Timbuktu. There are bogus universities. There are universities where you can purchase
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   and buy your degrees." The way to test the value of the honor is the discovery of the
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:02.040]   source from which the honor has come. And here you see the folly of a man. You see the
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.640]   man strutting with these great degrees after his name and clad. You say, "How wonderful.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:14.880]   How proud he is." Poor man, of course he is. It's because of his ignorance. It doesn't
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:21.280]   count in academic circles. They know the value of the degrees. Ah, but that's what men does
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:28.140]   in sin. That's what every man does who isn't a Christian tonight. He's seeking the bogus
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:34.040]   degrees given by man's university, and he's never sought the honors that the heavenly
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   university has got to give. Seeking honor one of another and seeking not the honor that
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:50.680]   comes from God only, he puts man before God. And is there any folly, I say, that is comparable
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.760]   to this? What is he guilty of? Well, let me note you some of the things. He is guilty
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.960]   of a gross overestimate of men. You receive honor one of another, says our Lord. And I
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.680]   showed you a fortnight ago that the whole world lives on this. We spend our time paying
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.440]   compliments to one another, writing things about one another, writing for one another.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:18.720]   The whole of society is governed by just this, being important in the eyes of one another.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:28.600]   What's it mean? It means we're overestimating man and his opinion. These honors that men
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:34.400]   and women are so keen on and which they'll spend money and time and energy in order to
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:46.120]   obtain them, where do they come from? From man, his finite character. Man! Why don't
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:53.480]   they stop to consider man's faulty judgment? Hasn't he always been wrong about these vital
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:24:00.320]   matters? Man who has claimed so much by last century, the politicians and the poets and
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.520]   the philosophers were all prophesying that the twentieth century was going to be a century
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:11.800]   of golden era, a century of bliss. They were all wrong, and yet we attach that value to
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:20.840]   their opinions and to their honors. Their judgments are so fallible and so faulty. Why
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:26.560]   do you seek honor from such a source and think how changeable their judgments are and their
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:33.800]   evaluations? They're always contradicting themselves and changing their opinions. Is
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.040]   this the source from which you seek honor? I say it's utter folly.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:52.560]   Or let me put it finally like this. Is man's record in this world such that we should value
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:25:01.880]   his high opinion and his commendation? Read your history books, your secular history books.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:09.200]   Read the story of man's inhumanity to man. Man, with all his learning and his ingenuity,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.600]   with his politics and his philosophy, look at the mess he's made of his world. It's
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:22.320]   man who's made the mess, not God. And yet we seek honor from such a source. We overestimate
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.840]   man and what he can give and the honor that he can pay us. And the man who does it is
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:36.840]   a fool. Listen to Isaiah, "Cease from man whose breath is in his nostril, for wherein
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:49.360]   is he to be accounted of." This finite character, this pygmy that would stride the world as
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:58.400]   a colossus. Look at him, examine him. And before you fall at his feet and seek the honor
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:09.320]   that he can give you, come to a true assessment of him. See him for what he is.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:17.560]   I say that any man who seeks honor that comes from men is a fool. He's overestimating men.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:25.960]   Ah, but look at the other side. Consider his appalling ignorance of God. He puts men before
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:32.920]   God. Why? Well, he overestimates men and he doesn't know the truth about God. Oh, that's
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.320]   the trouble with the world. We don't know God.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:47.120]   Oh, can you believe which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:54.920]   from God only? There's a better translation, "and seek not the honor that comes from the
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:08.160]   only God." There is only one God, and God is one. Millions and myriads of men and women,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:21.120]   millions of angels, but one God. You are out for honors that seek the exclusive, that want
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.000]   to get into the higher circles where there are but a few. Why don't you go to the topmost
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:43.840]   circle where God alone is the only God? Cease from men whose breath is in his nostrils,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:54.080]   and look to the Creator, the everlasting God, the governor of the ends of the earth, the
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:02.240]   God who made everything out of nothing, that sits on the circle of the universe, that suspended
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:10.360]   the north in the empty void.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:22.920]   Remember him. Do you remember Daniel's devastating denunciation? "Thou, that foolish king Belshazzar,"
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:35.840]   thou, he says, "hast honored the gods of wood and of stone and of stubble, and hast not
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:47.720]   glorified the God in whose hand thy breath all thy ways." The everlasting, the almighty
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:57.880]   God, the Lord of the universe, the judge of the whole earth, Lord of all beings, throne
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:15.800]   above, thy glory flames from sun and star, center and soul of every sphere.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:25.840]   And man doesn't seek the honor that he gives. He seeks the honors that man can give. Man
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:34.160]   doesn't seek the honor that the Lord of the universe, the everlasting God, can give to
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:41.520]   man. There's no need for me to press my point, is there? Is there anyone who dares to say
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:52.160]   at this moment that a man who's guilty of that is anything but a fool? But wait a minute.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:30:01.040]   He not only shows his folly in that way by setting men before God. Consider the type
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:07.440]   of honor that he chooses and the type of honor that he rejects. It isn't merely the source
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.960]   of honor in and of itself. Look at it. Let me hurry through it. Consider the type of
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.520]   honor that a man can give us, that men do give us. What are the characteristics of these
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:24.400]   honors? Well, they're essentially a sham. They're essentially artificial. You see, our
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.960]   Lord puts it very perfectly, doesn't he? He says, "You seek honor one of another." And
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:35.360]   we do. We give and we take. We fool ourselves. It's all a sham and a pretense. We set certain
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.160]   people up in great positions, and then, having done that to them, we then fall down before
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.080]   them and receive honors from them. We're simply playing with ourselves. We're behaving like
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.840]   children. Now, you know, we do this actually with kings and queens and presidents and people
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.240]   like that. They're nothing in and of themselves. We set them up, and then we say, "Ah, we want
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:04.800]   the honors that they can give." But it's we who've given them the honor. Think of countries
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:12.600]   that once were monarchies and where everybody bowed down before the king and the queen,
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.560]   but they've now become republics. They're the same people. These people who are kings
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.240]   and queens are still alive. They're the same people. But nobody bows the knee and does
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.040]   obey. Why? Well, man has taken from them the honor he gave them, and he's no longer interested
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:36.720]   in the honor they can give back to him. It's all a sham. It's artificial. It's all human
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:43.360]   invention and creation. It has no real being, no real meaning. But secondly, look how trivial
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.920]   it is. Even at its best and its highest, I needn't keep you. I think Shakespeare has
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:57.960]   used just one word that says it all, and absolutely perfect. Listen to him. "Seeking," he says,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:07.320]   "the bubble reputation, even in the cannon's mouth." Yes, you see, the point made by Shakespeare
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:14.520]   is that wherever a man seeks it, not only at the cannon's mouth but anywhere else, reputation
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:21.240]   is always a bubble, the iridescent bubble. It has color and form and shape but no substance
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:35.360]   and content, the bubble reputation. This reputation, this honor that men seek, it makes no difference
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.840]   to us essentially. It doesn't add to us. It's something we add on to our names. We put it
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.640]   on as a cloak. I'm thinking of money. I'm thinking of status. I'm thinking of degrees.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:53.080]   I'm thinking of knowledge. I'm thinking of personal appearance and smartness. I'm thinking
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:59.180]   of success in sport, some wonderful achievement in this or that. It's all artificial. It is
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.400]   all but a bubble. It doesn't really add to man's true essential greatness and dignity
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:15.440]   and character. And then think of the element of decay that is always in it. "Seek not such
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:22.200]   things as are, Lord, in the Sermon on the Mount, because moth and rust doth corrupt,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:28.720]   and thieves enter in and steal." And isn't that true of human reputation? Isn't that
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.440]   true of the honors that men can give to us? You who may pride yourself on your personal
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:40.080]   appearance and be flattered when people compliment you, you're proud of your face, you're proud
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.400]   of your figure, and people are. They put that first. There are those who reject God and
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:53.200]   Christ. Because of this, I say, wait a moment. "Moth and rust doth corrupt." The passing
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:00.160]   of the years will soon take that from you, and you will soon be molding and rotting in
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:09.680]   the grave. "Moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves enter in and steal." Look at the man
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.080]   who's complimented and who's proud of the fact that he's broken a record. He's run a
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.760]   mile in a shorter time than anybody else. How proud he is. Yes, but next day somebody
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:25.200]   beats his record, and where is he? Records are being broken day after day, and yet men
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:31.080]   pride themselves, and the world pays its compliment. But oh, how transient and evanescent it is.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:36.400]   Think of knowledge. "Ah," we say, "what a great man. Look at what he's discovered. Look
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.280]   at the knowledge the man has got." You know, in ten years' time it'll be absolutely out
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.600]   of date. The textbooks that were revered a century ago, nobody knows them now. You can't
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.640]   get anything for them from the second-hand bookseller. Why, they're out of date. They've
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:58.560]   gone. They're outmoded. Think of it in terms of politics. There is a man who rises to the
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.840]   top, and the whole world falls at his feet. He's acclaimed. He's the great man, and he's
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:15.720]   proud of the honor that men pay him. "Yes," says the wise poet again, "uneasy lies the
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:22.680]   head that wears the crown." There are others who are anxious to wear it. And they're plotting
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.040]   and scheming, and they're in rivalry against him, and they'll bring him down if they can.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.160]   And they always do bring him down. Oh, there's an element of decay in all these honors. And
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:42.880]   then think of its capriciousness, its uncertainty. Are you living for the good opinions of men,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.080]   for the honors that men and women can give you? Oh, there's nothing more changeable,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:58.480]   more unreliable, more capricious than this. Tastes change. Tastes in art, tastes in music,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:06.720]   tastes in poetry, tastes in drama, tastes in politics. There's nothing so capricious
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.800]   as human opinion and human praise. I mustn't keep you, my dear friends. Let me put this
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:19.760]   again in memorable words, which I think says the last word about this kind of thing. The
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:27.080]   confession of a man who'd lived to please men and to be honored by men, the aged dismissed
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:37.760]   Cardinal Wolsey, had I but served God as I have served the King, he would not have given
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:48.440]   me over in my gray hairs. He had sought a capricious honor from a capricious monarch.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:54.480]   And in his gray hairs on the verge of the grave, he is dismissed as favorite. He has
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.800]   nothing at all. And that applies to every honor given by man to man. It's unreliable,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:11.880]   and yet men seek this kind of honor. But again, look at the other side. Look at the honor
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:24.780]   that man in sin refuses. What a fool man is. Man wants to be noticed. He wants to be noticed
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:35.080]   by men. But what he doesn't seek is this, to be noticed by God. And yet that is what
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:42.040]   is true of every Christian. This is the honor that comes to every Christian. A Christian
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:51.600]   is a man who has been noticed by God. The God who has created the cosmos and who sustains
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:38:00.480]   everything, has his eye upon all things. He's got his eye upon that unknown Christian. He
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.960]   not only has his eye upon him now, he had his eye upon him before the foundation of
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:11.640]   the world. The Bible tells us that as Christians, our names were written in the Lamb's book
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:17.160]   of life before the foundation of the world. Do you want notice? Do you want honor? Do
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.800]   you want to be important? Well, here it is, that God has written your name in his book
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:28.680]   of life before the foundation of the world. He knows you. Not only that, he has set his
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:41.440]   affection upon you. He loves you. He has put your name into the plan of redemption. He
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:47.360]   sent his Son from heaven to earth and to the cross on Calvary's hill and to the grave
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:54.640]   for you. You are interested in honors, had you thought of that, that the Son of God should
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:02.400]   die for you. That's true of every Christian. "The Son of God," says Paul, "who loved me
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:19.080]   and gave himself for me." Oh, this is honor, to be sought by God. Not at this point that
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:26.800]   I seek him, but that he sought me. "Yes," says Francis Thompson, "that's why I am what
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:39.240]   I am. He chased me down the nights and down the days." God, the hound of heaven, chasing
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:47.560]   Francis Thompson. And God seeks every man who becomes a Christian, and he draws him
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:55.920]   with the cords of his love. "I found a friend, oh, such a friend. He loved me, ere I knew
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:04.440]   him. He drew me with the cords of love, and thus he bound me to him." God calling us,
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:10.920]   drawing us, then, through the death of his Son, reconciling us unto himself. This is
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:18.440]   the honor that God gives. And then, you see, as the result of all this, to know God. Our
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:24.480]   Lord says that that is eternal life. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee,
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.840]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." What does man live for? Oh, I'll
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.760]   tell you what man lives for. He wants to know the important people. He says, "You know,
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.880]   I'm very hopeful that I'll have an introduction next week. I've got the wheels moving, I'm
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.960]   making my arrangement." He wants to be presented. He wants to meet this man. He's very high
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:49.720]   up. He's most important. Ah, to know so-and-so, it's the height of their ambition. And yet,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:41:00.000]   to the lowliest, most insignificant, unknown Christian is offered knowledge of God, to
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:15.880]   be able to say, "My God," and not only to know him as God, but to know him as my Father,
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:22.520]   to become his child. Let me put it like this again. Though you may have the honor of being
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.800]   presented to the Queen in Buckingham Palace, she may even shake you by your hand. Do you
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.360]   know when you go out, you're still a commoner? You boast about it, yes, but you're still
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.480]   a commoner. You're not adopted into the royal family. You're merely presented, and out you
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:43.120]   go. But here, not only do you know God, he takes you into his family. He adopts you.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:56.680]   The adoption of children. Exactly. Taken into the very household of God. No more strangers
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:05.680]   and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God. Honor.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.880]   You were interested in honors. Have you sought this? And to have his Holy Spirit resident
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:18.560]   within you, and oh, this how valuable it is, and how tender, to have access always into
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:28.020]   his presence. No formalities to go through, no wires to pull. In the hour of your agony
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.800]   when your heart is breaking and you don't know what to do nor where to turn, the way
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:38.120]   is open, the gate is open. When all things seem against me to drive me to despair, I
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:45.760]   know one gate is open, one ear will hear my prayer. Oh, what a privilege, having access,
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.240]   having the ability of an audience, whenever you like, wherever you are, and whatever your
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.240]   condition.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:43:01.480]   Having, therefore, brethren, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, boldness to
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:13.600]   enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus. And then to enjoy fellowship with
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:21.400]   God, and to be able to take your cares, your problems, and all your requests to him, and
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.360]   to know on top of this that he is guarding you and shielding you and protecting you and
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.000]   guiding you. Do you know, said Christ, the very hairs of your head are all numbered?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.040]   Nothing can happen to you apart from God. He knows the falling of a sparrow. How much
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:41.880]   greater is interest in you. He has numbered the very hairs of your head. That is an interest,
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:49.080]   the God of heaven taking that interest in you.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   And not only to know God and to be his child, but because of that to be an heir of God,
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:04.800]   and a joint heir with Christ. Not only to be blessed by him daily in this world, but
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:12.840]   to know that you go on beyond this world to the possession of things which I have not
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:21.480]   seen or heard, which have not entered into the heart of man. Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:28.320]   Ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions. I go
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:37.720]   to prepare a place for you. Think of it, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, and beyond
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:44.920]   it all to spend your eternity in the glorious presence of God.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:51.720]   My dear friends, does it need demonstration or proof? A man who seeks the bubble reputation
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:45:00.800]   and does not seek this, there is only one thing to say about him. He is a fool!
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:10.920]   And for me to close, don't you see how this means that you set time before eternity? Look
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:16.280]   at the honor of men, listen to the Bible on it, listen to Christ on it. "All flesh is
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:22.560]   as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:33.200]   the flower thereof falleth away. Change and decay in all around I see." And yet men and
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:43.680]   women seek it. Time! It is going to end the pleasures of sin for a season, and for a season
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:54.440]   only. "All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of grass. The grass
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:03.880]   withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. But the word of the Lord abideth forever."
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:09.040]   Yes, this man Moses, he was not seeking the pleasures of sin for a season. He had his
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:15.600]   eye on the recompense of the reward. His eye was on glory, on the city which has foundations,
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:24.960]   whose builder and maker is God. A man who puts the pleasures of time before the glories
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:35.200]   of eternity is a fool. A man who forgets his everlasting and eternal destiny, who ignores
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:41.360]   death and the grave, and the judgment of God beyond death and the grave, and who sees that
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:50.000]   his eternal destiny is involved, a man who does not see that, I say, is a fool. Time
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:02.480]   he puts before eternity. And finally, "Is there anything which is quite as mad and as
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:13.640]   vain and as foolish as this? To strive, to sweat, to agonize, to spend money and time
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:28.240]   and energy in trying to obtain man's honor and favor, and to refuse to receive the honor
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:44.800]   which comes from God, for nothing, as a free gift through the hands of Jesus Christ? Is
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:52.600]   there anything to say about it but that it is folly? To strive and sweat, to vie with
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:48:03.640]   others and to compete for man's honor, this passing, ephemeral, bubble honor?"
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:12.800]   And God, in the meantime, is offering freely, for nothing, all the riches of his grace,
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:23.680]   the unsearchable riches of Christ, for nothing at all, simply that we acknowledge and confess
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:37.040]   our sin and our need, and ask him to receive us as paupers, as helpless, vile creatures.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:51.360]   My dear friend, I have put the position before you. Where are you? Which are you seeking?
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:49:01.480]   Surely any man who has listened must come to this conclusion and say this, "Just as
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:17.120]   I am of that free love, the height, length, depth, and height to prove, here for a season,
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:36.160]   above, O Lamb of God, I come." It is one or the other. You are either seeking the honor
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:50.300]   that men give, or you are seeking the honor that comes alone from the living God, through
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:50:06.140]   Jesus Christ his Son. Come to him, just as you are, without one plea, but that thou bid
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:23.080]  st me come to thee. "O Lamb of God, I come." See the folly of putting men before God, such
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:38.260]   trumpery on us, before God's riches, time before eternity, and rejecting the free gift
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:59.340]   of God's grace. See it, and turn to him, and he will receive you, and give you the
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.340]   gift divine. Amen. We do hope that you've been helped by the
