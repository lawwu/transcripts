[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.200]   Pastor John, you're off to Indianapolis for the Gospel Coalition's 2019 National Conference.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.720]   There you're going to be delivering the opening plenary address of the conference today on
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.480]   Monday, that's 1 p.m. at the Indiana Convention Center.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.720]   Please be praying for that.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.320]   Please be praying for Pastor John.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.520]   I'm not sure if that message is going to be live streamed.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.120]   I assume so, but I'm not sure.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.000]   But first, before you go, today's question comes to us from a listener named Austin.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.480]   In my Bible study, I've been stumped by the phrase that says Jesus has become much superior
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.440]   to angels.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.840]   If Jesus has eternally existed as God, how do I understand this passage and the theme
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.640]   that seems to pop up in Hebrews?
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.160]   Why and how did Jesus somehow become superior to angels?"
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.720]   Well, first thing I'd say is I love this kind of question.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.040]   I just think that's so important that we not gloss over apparent difficulties and just
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.560]   read on and let them dangle.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.640]   The text that Austin is referring to is found in Hebrews 1.4, and it's interesting that
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.880]   you don't have to leave this text, its immediate context, in order to see that in the mind
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.600]   of the writer, the Son of God has always existed as superior to angels.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.560]   So then how does he become superior if he's always superior?
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   So let me read it.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.040]   So I'll start at verse 3 of Hebrews 1.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:46.120]   He that is the Son of God is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.160]   of his nature.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.220]   No angel could ever have that said about him.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.600]   And he upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.960]   So none of that can be said of any angel.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.080]   The Son of God is by nature God, and the Son upholds the universe.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   So in what sense then did he become superior to angels?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.540]   Here's what verse 4 goes on to say.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.800]   After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   than theirs.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   So two massive realities explain the sentence in which the Son of God becomes superior to
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   angels.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.520]   The first massive reality is the incarnation.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.560]   And the second one is the triumph of the God-man over sin and death and Satan by his death
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.240]   and resurrection.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.680]   So the first one, the incarnation, the first reality that explains how he becomes superior
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   to angels is that the incarnate Son of God is a new reality.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.060]   The God-man, Jesus Christ, did not exist before the incarnation.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.340]   So since he didn't exist from all eternity, the God-man, the union of divine and human
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:28.540]   nature, since he didn't exist from all eternity as the God-man, the God-man can become superior
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.140]   to angels, which in fact he did by virtue of his divine nature, but especially his triumph
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.660]   at work on the cross.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.780]   That leads us to the second great reality, which is probably the one that gets the most
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.820]   focus in the New Testament.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.100]   So the second reality that makes sense out of the Son of God becoming superior to angels
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.940]   is that he did what no angels could ever do.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.060]   In his divine human nature, he went to the cross and he bore the sins of his people,
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.780]   and he disarmed the angelic principalities and powers and defeated death and rose from
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.340]   the dead and is enthroned with a new authority to do what only God can do because of what
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.840]   he did as the God-man on the cross.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.080]   So the very question that Austin is asking is also raised in other places.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.660]   This may help to bring in another way of asking the same kind of thing.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.980]   For example, in Matthew 28, 19, Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.140]   been given to me."
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.460]   Well, didn't he always have as the Son of God authority over everything?
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.460]   He did.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.560]   He did.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.940]   By virtue of his death and resurrection, however, it says, an authority was given to Jesus.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.100]   What he didn't have before was this.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:13.980]   He hadâ€”I mean, he gets the authority now as the God-man to exercise his eternal omnipotence
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:24.520]   in the service of a blood-bought people to whom he now becomes the agent of mercy because
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.180]   of what he did on the cross.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.940]   So that's a new authority.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.500]   I mean, John 17, 1 and 2 says it like this.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:42.420]   God gave him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:51.060]   So the authority that he always had in terms of omnipotence is now used on the basis of
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.460]   his blood and righteousness to give eternal life.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.020]   He couldn't do that before he did the saving work.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.980]   And so that's a new authority or a new exercise of authority on the analogy of becoming superior.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.100]   And here are a couple more examples of this kind of thing.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.260]   Peter cries out on the Day of Pentecost, "Let all the house of Israel therefore know for
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.340]   certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ."
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.280]   That's Jesus whom you crucified.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.220]   So the Son of God has always been Lord of the universe.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:39.540]   But the crucified and risen Christ is now installed in a new office as Lord and Messiah
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.800]   over his redeemed people and in this way becomes superior to angels.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:55.140]   Or Romans 1, 3 and 4, where Paul says that the gospel concerns God's Son who was descended
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:02.300]   from David according to the flesh and was declared Son of God in power according to
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.260]   the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:14.500]   So by the resurrection, by the resurrection, an event in history, the God-man Jesus is
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:22.820]   declared to be Son of God in a new way, namely in power over sin, over death, over evil,
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.100]   and in that way.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:32.620]   His newness, the newness of his sonship becomes superior to angels in a way he didn't experience
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.780]   before.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.100]   Or 1 Peter 3.21, "Baptism is an appeal to God for a clear conscience through the resurrection
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.080]   of Jesus who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels and authorities
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.560]   and powers having been subjected to him."
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.820]   So the death and resurrection of Jesus disarmed the angels, disarmed the authorities and powers,
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.700]   brought them into a new kind of subjection to the Son of God who had stripped them of
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.860]   the one weapon with which they could damn us, namely unforgiven sin.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.540]   And in this way he shows his superiority over all the angels.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:20.520]   One more example, Romans 14.9, "To this end Christ died and lived again that he might
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:28.300]   be Lord," of course he was always Lord, but he did something in dying and rising that
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.820]   made him Lord in a new way.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   So let me finish it.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:38.740]   "To this end Christ died and lived again that he might be Lord both of the dead and
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.900]   of the living."
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:49.060]   If Christ had not died and lived again, he would not hold the office of saving Lord over
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.060]   his people.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.040]   There would be no salvation.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:09:00.100]   There would be no saving Lordship in the universe had Jesus not died and risen from the dead.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:10.820]   So in all these ways, the God-man who died and rose again for sinners has become, attained
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:20.300]   a new level, a new kind of relationship to angels and to man as superior to angels in
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.340]   a way that didn't exist before.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.340]   Excellent.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.740]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.820]   And remember, Pastor John is off to Indianapolis delivering the opening address at the Gospel
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.620]   Coalition's 2019 National Conference at the Indiana Convention Center.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.820]   That's at 1 p.m. today on Monday.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.060]   Be watching for that and please be praying for him.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.140]   Well, we return on Wednesday to address a 23-year-old man who feels called to pastoral
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.180]   ministry and he thinks he should forego seminary training and jump right into the work.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.180]   What will John Piper say?
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.140]   We'll find out on Wednesday.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.140]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.140]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.400]   We'll see you then.
