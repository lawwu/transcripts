[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.680]   - Pastor John, in yesterday's episode, in episode 636,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.440]   you gave us half a dozen reasons
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.720]   why we addictively grab our phones
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.240]   when we wake up in the morning.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.540]   And you said that you had a remedy, a better course forward.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.220]   Please share that with us here today on the podcast.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.180]   - It might be helpful just to mention,
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.840]   just to name the six things that I said
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.680]   tend to draw me to my phone in the morning.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.000]   I said there's a novelty hunger.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.260]   I said there's an ego hunger.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.800]   I said there's a entertainment hunger.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.760]   And then I said there's these three avoidances,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.360]   like boredom avoidance.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.260]   I just don't wanna, you know, a boring day.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.040]   There's responsibility avoidance
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800]   and there's hardship avoidance.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.320]   So there are pretty strong things
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   that are keeping us in bed and keeping us on our devices.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.800]   But there is a better way.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400]   And here's what points to the need for it.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.320]   What if you are the first one to the news
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.980]   and it is horrible news?
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.980]   Or what if your search for some ego candy finds ego acid
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.520]   and people have hated you overnight?
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.960]   And what if you spend five minutes
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.280]   getting yourself happily entertained in the morning
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.400]   rather than facing the responsibilities
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.680]   of the day immediately?
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.840]   And you find at the end of those five minutes
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.800]   that they have drug you down into silly, demeaning,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   small-minded, hollow, immature frame of mind.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.360]   Was it worth it?
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   And what if you take five minutes to avoid the boredom
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.160]   and responsibility and hardship of the day,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.920]   only to find at the end of those five minutes of avoidance,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   you are spiritually, morally, emotionally less able
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   to cope with reality in the day than you were before.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.760]   Was it worth it?
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.520]   So I think there is a better way to begin the day.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   And it will require some decisions before the morning.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.840]   It never works to make last minute efforts
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.480]   to decide to do something different.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.600]   You need to decide 12 hours earlier
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.760]   what this crisis moment is going to look like.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.440]   It will take some planning.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.280]   It will take some alarm clock thinking and setting.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.920]   You know, just a little princess here.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640]   I wrote to the guys at the ESV and I said,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.000]   "Is there a device?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.280]   Is there a way to use the ESV app or the ESV
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.240]   so that you could set your alarm
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.960]   to go off with scripture reading?"
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.880]   And they wrote back and said, "Oh, that's a great idea."
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.280]   And they said, "It really is possible."
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.400]   And it was so complicated, I couldn't figure it out.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   But I would just say to somebody,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.720]   if you can figure that out, that's a great idea.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.120]   In other words, just go ahead and set your alarm
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.480]   to start reading the Bible to you.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.240]   And I think they're going to work on making it simpler.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.620]   So close that princess.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.920]   What we want in the morning routine
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.760]   is to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.480]   We want something that gives us a zeal
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.360]   for the glory of Christ for the day's work.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.680]   We want to be strengthened
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.560]   to face whatever the day may bring.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.120]   We want something that gives us joyful courage
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.720]   to resolve, to count others better than ourselves
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.000]   and pursue true greatness, like Jesus said,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.680]   by becoming the servant of all.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.440]   That's the real agenda in the morning.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.960]   Very few of us wake up strengthened
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.000]   to do all those glorious things
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.920]   that we get to join Jesus in doing.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.040]   So the new course for the morning,
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.200]   I think, is laid out in the Psalms.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.640]   And here's a key verse, Psalm 5:3.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   "O Lord, in the morning, you hear my voice.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.160]   In the morning, I prepare a sacrifice for you,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.200]   and I watch."
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.480]   So let the first thing out of your mouth in the morning,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.940]   while you're still on the pillow,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.240]   let the first thing be a cry to God.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.440]   I love you, Lord.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.160]   I need you, Lord.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.020]   Help me, Lord.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.800]   That is the first cry out of my mouth in the morning.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.040]   I need you again today.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.200]   Then prepare a sacrifice and watch.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.800]   I think that sacrifice is my body
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.560]   and my attention devoted to him.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.480]   I watch for the Lord to show up and do what?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.720]   What am I watching for?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.840]   And Psalm 143 puts it like this, verse eight.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.920]   "Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.480]   for in you I trust.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.040]   Make me know the way I should go,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.160]   for to you I lift up my soul."
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.720]   So I'm looking, I'm on the lookout
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.800]   for the steadfast love of God,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.960]   and I'm on the lookout for it in his word.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.320]   And then Psalm 90, verse 14,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   tells me how to think about praying for it when it comes.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.480]   Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.640]   Don't just look for it and see it and here it comes,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.600]   but ask the Lord, "Oh, satisfy me with this steadfast love
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.680]   that I may rejoice and be glad in you all our days."
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.720]   So we watch in God's inspired word
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.280]   for revelations of his steadfast love
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.320]   and his guidance for our lives
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   and a profound sense of satisfaction in our souls
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   that he is beautiful and that he cares for us.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.760]   Psalm 119, "My eyes are awake before the watches
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.720]   of the night that I may meditate on your promise."
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   Psalm 139, 17, "How precious to me are your thoughts,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.520]   O God, I awake and I am still with you."
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   So I suggest that before you go to bed tonight,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.800]   you make some choices and some plans
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   and that you free yourself from the candy addictions
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.480]   and the habits of avoidance
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   that have been ruining the strengthening potential
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.320]   for the beginning of the day.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.960]   - Beautiful, those are wise words, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.280]   And if you have a question
