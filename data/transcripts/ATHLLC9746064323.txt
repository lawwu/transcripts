[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.940]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and normally you'll find me
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   doing a deep dive on one of those topics myself,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.000]   or talking to the world's best experts
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.360]   that shape their success.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.560]   So, if you're new here,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.380]   and you wanna get a good feel for the show,
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320]   you can check out last week's episode
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.140]   where I shared my end of the year checklist
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.440]   for your money, your taxes, your points, and your miles,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.400]   or the week before, where I talked to Bill Perkins,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.960]   author of Die With Zero,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.880]   about why you might wanna focus more of your time and energy
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.200]   on your life's net fulfillment than on your net worth.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   At least from all of your feedback,
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.320]   that episode might've been the best one this year.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.420]   Or finally, if you wanna go all the way back
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.300]   to the beginning, to episode one,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.280]   it was an incredible episode with my good friend Lee Rowan,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.540]   all about travel hacks.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.520]   But for this week, with the holidays getting closer,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.880]   I thought I'd put together a list
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.960]   of my favorite products, gifts, past purchases, and more,
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240]   so that hopefully some of those
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.460]   might make good gift ideas for you or a loved one
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.960]   this holiday season.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.360]   And you should know that none of the products or services
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.180]   I put in this gift guide have paid me
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.540]   to be a part of the list.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.500]   However, some of them are sponsors of all the hacks,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.600]   but that should make sense, because as I've said before,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.400]   most of my sponsors are here
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.760]   because I've reached out to them
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.000]   after already loving their products.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960]   In fact, for any of the companies I'm about to talk about
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.920]   who aren't sponsors, I will certainly be adding them
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   to the list of brands I should reach out to next year
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.060]   to see if they wanna work together,
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.200]   though Necker Island is probably a bit of a long shot,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.160]   but we'll get to that later.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.480]   A great example of that is StoryWorth.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.900]   After I decided to include them in this gift guide,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.760]   I reached out to them, and they ended up wanting
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.820]   to sponsor the episode.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.280]   Finally, while I normally create short links
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000]   like allthehacks.com/viorey to make it easy for you,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.560]   there would be way too many links for this episode,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.080]   so I'm only gonna do that when there's a deal involved.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.480]   However, you can find links to everything I'll mention
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120]   in the show notes, at allthehacks.com,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.480]   or in the written version of this gift guide
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.520]   at allthehacks.com/gifts.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.000]   And since some of the links,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.280]   though definitely not all of them,
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.040]   are from sponsors or affiliates like Amazon,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.320]   I would greatly appreciate you clicking those links
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.600]   to support the show,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.020]   that is, unless you find a better price elsewhere,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.720]   in which case, absolutely go there.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.140]   Okay, let's get into the 2022 gift guide right after this.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.520]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.920]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.800]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.940]   for a good hang.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.960]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.920]   and let our sponsor, Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.440]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.280]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.700]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.680]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.240]   that you got through another week.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.320]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.880]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.640]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.400]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.960]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.940]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.980]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.800]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.880]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.520]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.000]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.080]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.920]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.940]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.180]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.320]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.800]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.400]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.840]   in your situation,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.440]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.700]   So, I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.560]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.720]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.240]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.640]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.600]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.920]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.040]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.400]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.120]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.920]   are first generation wealth,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.000]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.140]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.480]   and learn from each other
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.080]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.360]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.700]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.120]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.280]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.740]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.180]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.840]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.280]   So many of these conversations
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.500]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.160]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.020]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.200]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.280]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.400]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.920]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.520]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.400]   Okay, so the first section I'm gonna do is home and food,
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   and I'm gonna start with the Breville Tea Maker.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.240]   This has been in our kitchen for over a decade,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.800]   and it gets used daily.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.400]   If you brew loose leaf tea, it makes the process so easy,
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.760]   letting you dial in the temperature and the brew time,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.200]   and automates the rest.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.920]   And if you also brew coffee, it's a fantastic water kettle
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.880]   where you can set the exact temperature,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.280]   though I imagine there are much cheaper kettles out there
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.720]   if you don't wanna make tea.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800]   Next, trade coffee.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.080]   Based on the smile that shows up on Amy's face
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.880]   every time she opens up a box from Trade,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.720]   I am really confident that this would be an amazing gift
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.480]   for anyone who loves coffee.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.720]   Every delivery, they'll get a new curated bag of coffee beans
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.920]   from the top independent roasters all across the country.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.080]   And best of all, you can get up to $50 off gifts
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.400]   at allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.360]   Next is the Coravin.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.520]   There are plenty of nights where Amy or I,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.000]   and probably both of us,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.800]   wanna have a glass of wine with dinner,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.440]   or after the kids go to bed,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.880]   but we don't really wanna finish an entire bottle.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.240]   So we used to either skip the wine altogether,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.280]   or just end up drinking the entire bottle
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.960]   even though we didn't need to.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   But then we got a Coravin as a gift,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.880]   and it's changed the way we drink wine.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.480]   It's a device with a small hollow needle
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.200]   that you can stick through the cork of a bottle of wine,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.000]   and it lets you pour out the wine,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.400]   and replaces the space that that wine took up
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.800]   with argon gas, which keeps your wine fresh.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   So you could pour yourself a half a glass,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.680]   or a glass of wine without ruining the bottle,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.400]   and drink the rest of it days, weeks, or even months later.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.240]   And if you really wanna splurge,
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.000]   my dad got a plum wine dispenser as his retirement gift,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.680]   which is like a supercharged Coravin machine,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   where you can put two bottles of wine in,
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   and it taps them just like a Coravin machine would,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.620]   and turns it into a dispenser.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.400]   It is amazing, but really expensive.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.000]   Okay, the next one is one of my favorite things.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.520]   If you've ever been to Japan,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.960]   you've probably been fortunate enough
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.840]   to enjoy a Japanese toilet.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.920]   If not, there's a heated seat,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.760]   heated water bidet, and so much more.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.640]   And despite that some of those toilets
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.500]   can cost thousands of dollars,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.520]   you can actually just get the seat
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.240]   to attach to your current toilet for less than 500.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.680]   I love the Toto Washlet C5.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.320]   We have one in our house,
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.480]   but if you wanna save a little money,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.000]   you can get the less expensive Washlet C2,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.880]   which we just put in the bathroom we renovated.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.080]   And if you have a Costco membership,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.780]   it's on sale right now through Costco.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.120]   Okay, I feel ridiculous recommending a $40 hand soap,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.100]   but the Aesop soap we have in our house
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.720]   has gotten more compliments from house guests
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.320]   than just about anything else in the entire home.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.240]   Not to mention,
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.840]   if you haven't used your $50 Amex credit for sacks,
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.400]   you can use that to make Aesop soap free,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.360]   which is exactly what I do
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.600]   because I don't think I could actually spend $40.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.160]   But when it comes to gifts,
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.520]   I think it's the best hand soap out there,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   and I love it, and it would make a great gift.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Next is Whiskey River Soap,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   who makes a snarky candle for just about any situation
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.840]   you could ever imagine.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.760]   I've given these to guests who've come on the podcast.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.960]   I've given them to random friends, colleagues.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.340]   They will put a smile on almost anyone's face,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.760]   and they are one of my go-to gifts
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.720]   if I'm not spending too much.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.280]   Definitely recommend them.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.000]   You've probably seen them in the newsletter before.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.580]   And in the spirit of food,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.720]   I have talked about the Paprika app a lot
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.200]   'cause I think it's the best way to organize recipes
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.000]   and your family meal planning,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.960]   but for an app, it's a bit pricey.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.840]   It's $5 on mobile, $30 on desktop,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.760]   and you have to buy it for every platform you use it.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.680]   But I actually think that it could be
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.400]   a really interesting gift
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.720]   because not only could you give someone an amazing app,
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.360]   but you could preload it with all of your favorite recipes
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.560]   and share them to whoever you give the app to.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.420]   So it's not only a great app,
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.360]   but it would also be a curated list
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.480]   of all your favorite foods.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.520]   And finally, the Ooni Pizza Oven.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.680]   So we love making pizza at home,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.280]   and a few years ago, we gave an Ooni coda
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.840]   to a family member at Christmas,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.600]   and it was a huge hit.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   Not to mention, it gave us an amazing family activity
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.200]   one night during the holidays,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.840]   and we were making pizza all night long.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   Definitely makes a great gift for someone.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.120]   Next section is tech gear and clothes.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.440]   So I'll start with Viore.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.820]   They make the most amazing performance apparel.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.400]   It's ridiculously comfortable,
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.560]   and seriously, Amy and I probably wear it every single day.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.720]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.240]   but you really can't go wrong with anything they make,
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   and you can get 20% off your first order
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.640]   at allthehacks.com/viore, V-U-O-R-E.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.220]   Next is the Blunt Umbrella.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.400]   We bought our yellow Blunt Classic Umbrella six years ago,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.800]   and it still works as well as it did the day we got it.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.520]   It's also so incredibly wind-resistant.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.200]   I haven't tried their travel umbrella,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.000]   but it looks like it's gonna rain this week in London,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.200]   and I really wish I had one with me.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.840]   Okay, I know all of you aren't starting a podcast,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.720]   but I wanna suggest a USB microphone,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.600]   because when I first bought one for the podcast,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.080]   I ended up actually starting to use it
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   for all my remote work meetings,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.360]   and I got such good feedback from my colleagues
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.600]   on the audio quality.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.720]   I remember someone saying,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.340]   "Wow, your audio sounds so good.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.480]   "It makes everything you say sound so much more believable."
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.920]   And then a few of those colleagues
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.020]   actually bought a microphone themselves.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.120]   So a great starter mic under $100
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.900]   that I used for the whole first year of this podcast
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.180]   was the ATR2100X, but if you want something a little better,
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.040]   you can get the Shure MV7,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.720]   which is what I'm actually recording on right now.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.520]   And if you need an arm to mount it on your desk,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.960]   there are a bunch of cheap ones for $20 or $30 on Amazon.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.940]   They work, I used them early on,
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.160]   but the Rode PSA1 is so much better.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.200]   Okay, next, the M2 MacBook Air.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.280]   It is hard to think of a purchase I made in 2022
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.400]   that was better than upgrading my laptop
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.320]   to the new M2 MacBook Air.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.860]   It's so fast and having 14 plus hours of battery life
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.880]   is absolutely incredible.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.640]   I honestly can't imagine what it would be like
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.740]   to go back to a computer
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.880]   that I have to charge every three or four hours.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.420]   Sure, it's probably more expensive
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.740]   than anyone's planning to spend
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.420]   on a gift this holiday season.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.260]   However, maybe if you have a business
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.820]   and you need to get a few more expenses in
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.940]   before the end of the year,
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.140]   this could be a really great upgrade.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.820]   But in line with the theme of work,
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.860]   with so many of us working from home,
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.480]   one of the luxuries that I really, really appreciate
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.960]   is having a standing desk in my home office.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.360]   They used to be so expensive,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.480]   but Uplift makes some really reasonably priced desks
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.040]   and they're so well-built.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.720]   I know because my desk is an Uplift desk and I love it.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.400]   Also, I know some companies will even reimburse you
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.000]   for some home office equipment,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.680]   so definitely worth upgrading
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.960]   if you can get it for free from your employer.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.720]   Last in this list is Gooder Sunglasses.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.680]   They are my new favorite sunglasses.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.200]   I got a pair from Wealthfront
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.880]   as company swag and they were so good
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.120]   that I've since bought more for me and Amy
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.440]   and asked them to be a sponsor of the show.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.660]   They're 100% polarized,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.800]   they're lightweight, stylish, comfortable,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.840]   and best of all, they are only $25.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.600]   My favorites are the OGs,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.480]   but they have so many different styles
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.840]   and what seems like an unlimited selection of colors.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.440]   And you can get free shipping
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.240]   and a 30-day money-back guarantee
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.740]   at allthehacks.com/gooder, G-O-O-D-R.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.680]   Next is Health and Fitness.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.400]   So I know I've mentioned my Oura ring a lot,
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.920]   but it is the one thing that I am always wearing every day
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.720]   to track my sleep, my workouts, my heart rate, and HRV.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.440]   And the Gen 3 ring also tracks blood oxygen levels.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.880]   I've used up all my referrals,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.440]   so I don't have a link for you,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   but if you know anyone who has an Oura ring,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.520]   you can use their link to get an additional $50 off.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.760]   Next is the Eight Sleep Pod Cover.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.560]   This is an expensive purchase,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.680]   but traveling just isn't the same
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.940]   now that we've been spoiled
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.100]   by our Eight Sleep Cover at home.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.860]   It not only tracks your sleep,
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.940]   but it also automatically heats and cools your mattress
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.860]   in line with your sleep cycles
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.380]   to help improve your deep sleep
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.100]   and improve your overall sleep quality.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.460]   It also warms up your bed right as you're getting into it,
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.220]   which given that every night in London
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.660]   it's been below freezing,
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.700]   would have been a really nice thing to have over here.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.340]   You can use my personal referral link
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.020]   for $200 off at allthehacks.com/eightsleep.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.080]   And next is InsideTracker.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.340]   So I think you all know
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.560]   that I love getting data on everything,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.200]   and that's totally true when it comes to my health,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.140]   and I've been a huge fan of InsideTracker
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.880]   since I started using it earlier this year.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.120]   They take your blood, DNA, and fitness tracking activity,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.780]   and they provide a personalized health analysis
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.880]   and action plan for exercise, nutrition, and supplementation,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.760]   and I think they do a really good job,
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.200]   and I'm really excited that they're a sponsor of the show,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.800]   which means you guys can all get 20% off
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.640]   at allthehacks.com/insidetracker.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.280]   Going back to sleep for a minute,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.200]   and you could argue that I should probably put this
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.480]   in the learning section that'll come up next,
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.080]   but since good sleep is so important to your health,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   I'll put it here.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.720]   And that is the book "Why We Sleep" by Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.480]   It is my favorite book on sleep.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.320]   It really is a collection of so much knowledge on the topic.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   I've been trying to get the author to join me
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.720]   on an episode of the podcast since I started,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.840]   but the book is so good,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.240]   it's really everything you need about sleep.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.480]   Last in this category is a Peloton.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.400]   Amy and I love our Pelotons so much,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.520]   and I highly recommend it to anyone
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.240]   who wants to work out at home,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.540]   even if you're not a cyclist,
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.180]   which I am certainly not and never have been.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.320]   It is such a good workout that gets even better
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.480]   when you have friends to compete with.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.720]   I don't think I've ever been able to push myself
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.160]   as hard as I could when I'm trying
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.840]   to either beat my friends' records
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.160]   or even my own personal record.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.120]   If you want $100 in free accessories,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.800]   you can use my referral code.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.400]   It's just allthehacks.com/peloton.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.040]   Next category is family and kids,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.200]   and there's a lot in here which is probably indicative
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.260]   of the new stage of my life.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.900]   So first, I wanna talk about Love Every.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.480]   We have had a subscription to Love Every
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.120]   since our first daughter was born,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.320]   and I love their products.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.520]   Every few months, they have a subscription
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.580]   that'll send you their award-winning Montessori-inspired
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.400]   toys to your home with a guide for exactly when
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.920]   and how to use them to help your child learn and grow.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.520]   And all their toys are designed
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.680]   by child development experts,
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.040]   they're well-built, and they're sustainably made.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.200]   If you want $20 off your subscription,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.640]   you can go to allthehacks.com/loveevery.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.680]   That's my personal referral code.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.880]   Next is StoryWorth, who is sponsoring this episode,
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.200]   but was on the list before I even connected with them.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.320]   If you have ever wanted to capture all the stories
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.680]   and memories from your loved ones,
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.460]   this is a great gift.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.000]   Every week for a year, they'll email your loved ones
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.220]   with a single life-related question like,
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.900]   what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.940]   or what's the farthest you've traveled?
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.780]   And then after the year is up,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.140]   they compile it into a hardcover book
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.880]   with stories, memories, and even photos
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.800]   that you can pass down for generations to come,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.480]   and you can get $10 off at allthehacks.com/storyworth.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.780]   Okay, a few cybersecurity things in here
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.820]   that I think are really important for family.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.580]   First, Delete.me.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.100]   It is crazy how many websites are out there
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.580]   sharing your personal data,
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.380]   your phone number, your home address,
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.500]   your relatives' names, your email, your birthday,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.820]   and it is so much work to try to get them
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.940]   to take it all down.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.000]   I know, because I tried to do all that work myself,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.800]   and it just wasn't worth it.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.380]   So I started using Delete.me,
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.060]   and they found stuff I couldn't even find myself.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.440]   They do it all for you.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.860]   They remove all of your info
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.140]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.540]   and while it might not be the most exciting gift
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.300]   in the world, I think it would be an amazing gift
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.360]   for anyone who has never done it.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.900]   Not to mention, you can get $20 off all Delete.me plans
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.420]   at allthehacks.com/delete.me.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.060]   And next, if anyone in your family
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.980]   is not using a password manager,
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.700]   I would recommend giving them a membership gift
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.040]   to 1Password.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   Until a few years ago,
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.780]   my parents were using the same passwords
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.380]   for so many different websites,
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.980]   so I actually gifted them a 1Password membership
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.380]   and helped them set it up,
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.700]   and since then, I feel so much more confident
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.500]   about their cybersecurity practices.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.900]   Another gift we actually gave my dad this year
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.740]   was an Aura photo frame.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.560]   Now, digital photo frames have been around for years,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.280]   but I've never found one that works as well as Aura.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.140]   It is so easy for you or anyone else in your family
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.140]   to share pictures with the frame that you give someone.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.820]   Between my and Amy's family,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.180]   I think there are four or five Aura frames
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.620]   in different homes, and it's been so awesome
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.020]   for everyone in the family to be able to share photos
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.140]   with everyone's frames and have them just pop up
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.520]   in our living room.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.160]   The next one's a bit of a strange one,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.520]   but it's the Nugget.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.620]   I'd say it's like part furniture, part toy,
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.900]   but all around, it's one of the best purchases
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.380]   we've made for our kids.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.620]   It's almost like a bunch of foam blocks
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.600]   that you can stack on top of each other.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.020]   We use it for story time.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.340]   We use it to make a slide down the stairs,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.880]   to build forts, and a lot more.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.100]   It looks from their website like they might not arrive
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.740]   by the end of the year if you order now,
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.640]   but I'm still including it on the list
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.660]   because I think it would make an amazing gift
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.140]   for any young kid.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.640]   Okay, I love escape rooms,
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.660]   so I think they would make an amazing gift for anyone.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.060]   Amy and I have probably done at least 50 together,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.280]   and we try to find the best room we can
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.920]   in every city we visit.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.100]   So if you're looking for a fun activity for your family,
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.980]   or even a good gift as a gift card,
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.620]   I can highly recommend an escape room.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.020]   There isn't an easy way to find the best room in a city
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.360]   other than just searching, looking on Reddit,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.860]   but I did find one site that I linked in the show notes
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.060]   that seems to have pretty good rankings in different cities
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.980]   if you're trying to find the best one.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.580]   But honestly, of the 50 rooms we've done,
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.240]   we've probably only ever done one bad one,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.020]   so I'd optimize more for doing it
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.840]   than trying to find the best.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.020]   And along the same lines of games,
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.460]   I wanna talk about board games,
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.900]   because I love board games,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.820]   and I think they make amazing gifts.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.340]   So I thought I'd share some of my favorites
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.020]   that I think you should all check out.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.180]   I left a few of the obvious ones like Catan off the list,
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.100]   but if you're listening and you have any suggestions for me,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.260]   please send them my way,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.240]   because I love collecting new awesome board games.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.700]   So the first one I'll mention is Coup.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.620]   This one's a bit hard to explain,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.540]   but it is the first game we pull out when friends are over,
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.140]   we take it traveling with us,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.660]   and if you've ever played a game like Werewolves or Mafia,
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.340]   you will definitely love it,
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.320]   but it does require a bit of bluffing.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.160]   You can play with two to six people,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.740]   the package is really small so it's easy to travel with,
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.220]   and games are quick.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.660]   Next is Ticket to Ride,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.300]   and maybe I should have excluded this
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.380]   because I know it's such a popular game,
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.940]   but Amy and I love it so much,
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.440]   I thought it's worth a mention.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.180]   It's two to five players, you can play as a family,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.540]   and unlike some of the other strategy games that I also love,
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.740]   this one does not take hours to play,
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.500]   which has recently become a requirement
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.700]   for games in our house.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.060]   I hope it's not too soon to talk about this next one,
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.660]   which is Pandemic Legacy Season One.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.340]   It is such an interesting game,
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.820]   I love it because it's so different.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.380]   It's a cooperative game,
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.980]   meaning everyone that's playing it is on the same team
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.100]   and they win or lose together,
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.340]   but Pandemic Legacy, unlike Pandemic itself,
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.660]   is really more like a choose-your-own-adventure book.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.980]   You can actually only ever play the game once,
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.760]   you level up characters, it's almost like an RPG game,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.360]   but in a board game style, and it's so good.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.380]   Two more great ones if you're looking for two-player games
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.460]   are Jaipur and Splendor.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.540]   Amy and I really love playing both of them,
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.760]   though we have a lot less time for games as we used to.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.540]   If you have a big group, I really love Codenames.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.980]   It's great for groups and can be played quickly,
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.900]   and if you're looking for a game to play with a team
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.860]   at a work event or an offsite, I think Codenames is great
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.260]   and we played it a lot at all the companies I've worked at.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.140]   Bonanza is also a fun game
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.540]   that we end up playing around the holidays with family
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.540]   because you can have up to seven players,
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.580]   you can play under an hour, and unlike a lot of games,
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.780]   it's really easy to learn the rules.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.100]   Finally, two I don't have,
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   but that are really high on my list.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.040]   One is Seven Wonders Duel,
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.060]   which is the two-player version of Seven Wonders,
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.860]   which is a game we have and love.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.660]   I've just heard so many good things about it
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.420]   that I wanted to put it on the list.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.340]   Also, a game that I didn't know anything about
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.740]   until researching this episode yesterday was Wingspan.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.940]   I don't have any interest in birdwatching,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.560]   but it seems like everyone in the last few years
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.840]   is saying that this game is at the top of their list,
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.280]   so it's something I definitely wanna check out.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.200]   If anyone listening is in my family
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.180]   and is looking for a last-minute gift idea, here it is.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.420]   Okay, the next section of gifts is all about learning.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.380]   If anyone in your family loves to learn,
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.620]   especially learn about money, about travel,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.820]   about optimizing life, you should obviously recommend
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.740]   that they check out this podcast
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.820]   or the All The Hacks newsletter,
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.600]   but another gift when it comes to learning
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.420]   that I think is great, and I can say that
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.940]   with a firsthand experience of giving it as a gift
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.180]   to my father last year, is a membership to MasterClass.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.860]   I could literally spend hours, if I had the time,
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.060]   watching all the classes they have.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.940]   There's literally a class for anyone,
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.900]   whether it's related to business or cooking or life
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.300]   or music or even skateboarding.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.660]   And right now, you can get two memberships
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.300]   for the price of one at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.780]   Moving to a few books, which I could probably
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.420]   have a huge list from so many
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.140]   of the awesome people I've interviewed,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.860]   so there's probably a little bit of recency bias here,
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.340]   but I have to start with Die With Zero.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.460]   This book and the interview I recently had
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.820]   with Bill Perkins had such a huge impact
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.620]   on the way I think about life and money
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.380]   that it has to be on the list, and I highly recommend it.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.780]   Next is The Two Hour Cocktail Party.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.940]   Not only could you actually use this book from Nick Gray
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.460]   to host an amazing cocktail party during the holidays,
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.980]   but I think it would make a great, fun gift
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.120]   or stocking stuffer for anyone.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.980]   Next is Vagabonding.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.900]   I've gifted this book more than any book in the world
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.900]   because it had such a huge impact on our lives.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.820]   It's actually the book that led to Amy and I
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.980]   traveling around the world for seven months,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.860]   so it's hard not to suggest it to anyone who likes travel.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.720]   And finally are any of the Death & Co cocktail books.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.420]   If you know anyone that likes cocktails
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.620]   or likes books that look great on your coffee table,
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.100]   then all of the Death & Co books would make fantastic gifts,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.860]   but my favorite is Cocktail Codex,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.620]   which basically breaks the entire world of cocktails
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.580]   down into six root cocktails that once you master,
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.680]   give you kind of the knowledge and skills you need
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.900]   to translate those root recipes
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.740]   into hundreds of different drinks.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.260]   Last is a Cozy Meal Cooking Class.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.380]   So we've booked a pasta making class,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.780]   a donut making class,
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.620]   and we even did a family Iron Chef challenge
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.060]   all through Cozy Meal,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.600]   and none of them have ever disappointed.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.940]   So if you want a fun gift for someone
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.900]   that lives in one of the cities they operate in,
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.340]   or you live there and you're looking for a cool activity
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.860]   to do over the holidays,
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.460]   I would highly recommend checking out what's on Cozy Meal.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.820]   Finally, the last category for this episode is travel.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.960]   I don't have too many travel gadgets,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.460]   but now that we have kids
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.220]   and we end up checking bags on every single trip,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.460]   I always make sure to keep an Apple AirTag
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.780]   in every one of our checked bags.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.340]   Fortunately, I haven't had to use them
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.700]   to locate a lost bag,
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.320]   and honestly, I hope I never have to,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.620]   but it is so comforting to be able to see
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.420]   that your bag made it on the plane,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.900]   or when you get to your destination,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.560]   see that the bag's coming,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.900]   or even just know that your bag is on route to the carousel
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.300]   so you're not sitting around waiting,
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.840]   wondering what's going on.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.700]   Next is the Stokke JetKids Bed Box.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.540]   This was an amazing gift to our daughter
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.420]   from my parents earlier this year,
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.140]   and it's so awesome.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.920]   It's a little suitcase with two extra features
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.660]   that make it the best for flights.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.420]   First, your kid can actually ride the suitcase,
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.520]   which means you can cruise through the airport.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.180]   But the most unique feature
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.320]   is that it turns into an elevated platform
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.060]   that can extend the chair your kid is sitting on
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.020]   all the way to the seat in front of them,
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.780]   giving them an entire lie-flat, first-class experience.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.340]   And while over 50 airlines have approved it,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.620]   almost all the major domestic carriers,
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.800]   Delta, American, JetBlue, Southwest, Alaska,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.100]   United is notably the exception
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.080]   and say they don't allow it on board,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   though I have heard that it's not always enforced.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.880]   Another one which we just bought for our trip to Europe
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.680]   that we're on right now is the BabyZen Yoyo Stroller.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.820]   It has been awesome.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.620]   It fits in the overhead compartment.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.660]   It feels really sturdy.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.460]   It's easy enough to pick up even when your kid's on it
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.120]   and you have to walk up and down the stairs
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.180]   at a metro station, at a subway station,
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.940]   and it really holds up value.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.200]   In fact, if you look for a used yoyo stroller online,
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.660]   they're not that much cheaper than buying them new.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.300]   So as long as you take reasonable care of it,
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.560]   I think that you'd be able to get back
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.640]   most of your money in a couple years.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.280]   Another travel thing is Away luggage.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.960]   Amy and I each have an Away carry-on suitcase
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.680]   and they are fantastic.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.000]   I don't know if they still have the option
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.660]   for the integrated battery, but I would skip that.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.520]   But other than that, it's a fantastic suitcase
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.660]   and it happens to be Wirecutter's top pick
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.560]   for a hard-sided carry-on.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.640]   And if you want $20 off, you can use my referral link
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.440]   at allthehacks.com/away.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.360]   And then any of the bags that Dagny Dover makes
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.200]   would make an awesome gift.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.400]   I think Amy's given Dagny Dover bags
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.120]   as gifts to friends and family more than any other gift.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.760]   Her favorites are the Landing Carry-All
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.320]   and the Dakota Backpack.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.200]   And if you want $20 off, Amy's referral link
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   is allthehacks.com/dagnedover, D-A-G-N-E-D-O-V-E-R.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.960]   And finally, the last one, which is a crazy one,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.540]   but it popped up in my Twitter feed
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.240]   and I thought I had to include it,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.760]   which is a week on Necker Island.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.280]   So if you're not familiar,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.520]   it's Richard Branson's private island
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.200]   and they finally opened it up
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.960]   and you can book a week with points.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.380]   So if you happen to have 1.7 million points
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.020]   burning a hole in your pocket,
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.440]   you are now able to book your week on the private island
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.960]   for free with points.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.800]   I'm sure it would be a fun adventure.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.440]   I'll link to a page in the show notes
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.000]   if you wanna read about it.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.840]   But realistically, I don't actually expect
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.680]   anyone listening to do this.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.760]   However, if you do, please let me know how it goes.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   I am dying to hear about it.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.280]   So that's all the gift recommendations I have,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.080]   but there are three things I wanna talk about
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.600]   to help you save money when you're doing
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.440]   any of your shopping this season.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.480]   The first is making sure you use cashback portals.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.600]   I always like to go to cashbackmonitor.com
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.160]   to see what the best way to earn cashback
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.900]   or points is when I'm shopping online.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.360]   However, some of the sites that are listed there
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.280]   are a pain to set up, so more often than not,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.360]   I end up just using Rakuten because it's easier
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.280]   and they let you earn Amex points instead of dollars.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.140]   So if you haven't signed up for Rakuten,
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.760]   you should definitely check it out.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.120]   And right now, you can get $30 free
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.600]   after your first purchase
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.040]   if you go to allthehacks.com/rakuten.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.900]   The next is finding promo codes, but also using live chat.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.360]   So I feel like it's gotten so hard lately
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.160]   to find a working promo code to use online.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.760]   I used to go to RetailMeNot,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.060]   and almost every code would work,
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.800]   but now it seems like every time I try to find a code,
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.360]   they all fail.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.880]   So the tactic that I use now is if a site has a live chat,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.520]   I just message them and ask for a discount.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.040]   I tell them what I'm looking to buy,
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.600]   and more often than not,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.760]   I end up getting some kind of discount.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.200]   Or even one time, someone said,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.660]   "I can't give you a discount, but if you search online,
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.100]   "you can find a referral link to get a discount,"
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.600]   like a lot of the referral links I've been sharing here.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.980]   So if you can't find a discount and there's no live chat,
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.040]   maybe go to Twitter and search Twitter
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.720]   for the name of the brand and promo code or referral,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.200]   and you might find people sharing their promo codes
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.880]   and their referral links online.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.160]   Finally, and I've talked about this before,
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.800]   is getting gift cards.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.120]   So most online retailers don't qualify
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.840]   for bonus points on your credit card.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.760]   I could always use my VentureX and get two points per dollar,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.480]   but whenever I'm shopping online,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.200]   I always try to see if I could go buy a gift card
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.600]   for the retailer somewhere where I'd earn more points.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.400]   My two go-tos are buying them at grocery stores
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.920]   where I can get four points with the Amex Gold,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.640]   or buying them on Amazon where I can get 5% back
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.160]   with the Amazon Prime card.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.480]   Or you might actually get a better deal
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.420]   going to a site like Card Cash,
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.920]   where you can buy discounted gift cards
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.120]   from people who are trying to get cash for their gift cards
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.620]   'cause they're not actually gonna use them.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.360]   So, those are my three favorite tips
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.280]   for saving money shopping online,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.680]   cashback portals, promo codes in live chat, and gift cards.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.240]   That's it for this episode of All The Hacks.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.520]   I hope this helps you find some good ideas
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.680]   for gifts this holiday season.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.320]   So thanks for listening and see you next week.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.220]   (upbeat music)
