[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.940]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and normally you'll find me
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   doing a deep dive on one of those topics myself,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.000]   or talking to the world's best experts
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.360]   that shape their success.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.560]   So if you're new here,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.380]   and you wanna get a good feel for the show,
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320]   you can check out last week's episode
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.140]   where I shared my end of the year checklist
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.440]   for your money, your taxes, your points, and your miles,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.360]   or the week before where I talked to Bill Perkins,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.960]   author of "Die With Zero,"
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.880]   about why you might wanna focus more of your time and energy
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.200]   on your life's net fulfillment than on your net worth.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   At least from all of your feedback,
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.320]   that episode might've been the best one this year.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.420]   Or finally, if you wanna go all the way back
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.300]   to the beginning, to episode one,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.280]   it was an incredible episode with my good friend Lee Rowan,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.540]   all about travel hacks.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.520]   But for this week, with the holidays getting closer,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.880]   I thought I'd put together a list
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.960]   of my favorite products, gifts, past purchases, and more,
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240]   so that hopefully some of those
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.460]   might make good gift ideas for you or a loved one
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.960]   this holiday season.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.360]   And you should know that none of the products or services
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.160]   I put in this gift guide have paid me
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.540]   to be a part of the list.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.500]   However, some of them are sponsors of all the hacks,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.600]   but that should make sense, because as I've said before,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.400]   most of my sponsors are here
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.760]   because I've reached out to them
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.000]   after already loving their products.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960]   In fact, for any of the companies I'm about to talk about
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.920]   who aren't sponsors, I will certainly be adding them
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   to the list of brands I should reach out to next year
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.060]   to see if they wanna work together.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.200]   Though Necker Island is probably a bit of a long shot,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.160]   but we'll get to that later.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.480]   A great example of that is StoryWorth.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.900]   After I decided to include them in this gift guide,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.760]   I reached out to them, and they ended up wanting
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.840]   to sponsor the episode.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.280]   Finally, while I normally create short links
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000]   like allthehacks.com/viorey to make it easy for you,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.560]   there would be way too many links for this episode,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.100]   so I'm only gonna do that when there's a deal involved.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.480]   However, you can find links to everything I'll mention
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120]   in the show notes, at allthehacks.com,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.480]   or in the written version of this gift guide
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.520]   at allthehacks.com/gifts.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.000]   And since some of the links,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.280]   though definitely not all of them,
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.040]   are from sponsors or affiliates like Amazon,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.320]   I would greatly appreciate you clicking those links
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.080]   to support the show, that is,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.020]   unless you find a better price elsewhere,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.720]   in which case, absolutely go there.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.140]   Okay, let's get into the 2022 gift guide right after this.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.760]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.080]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.260]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.200]   but one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.640]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.480]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   from Anyday, I am a total convert,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.220]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.520]   for this episode.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.560]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.820]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave,
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.160]   and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.760]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.740]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.900]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.120]   freezer, and oven-safe too.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.720]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.920]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.220]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.560]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.620]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.740]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.740]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.220]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.720]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.320]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.980]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.340]   as you build your wealth.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.620]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.480]   Longangle is a community of high-net-worth individuals
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.620]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.720]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.160]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.560]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.520]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.840]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.960]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.320]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.040]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.840]   are first-generation wealth,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.920]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.060]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.400]   and learn from each other
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.000]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.280]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.620]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.040]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.200]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.640]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.080]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.760]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.200]   So many of these conversations
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.420]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.080]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.960]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.120]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.200]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.320]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.800]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.480]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   Okay, so the first section I'm gonna do is home and food,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.920]   and I'm gonna start with the Breville TeamMaker.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.120]   This has been in our kitchen for over a decade,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.680]   and it gets used daily.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.280]   If you brew loose leaf tea, it makes the process so easy,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.680]   letting you dial in the temperature and the brew time,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.100]   and automates the rest.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.800]   And if you also brew coffee, it's a fantastic water kettle
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.760]   where you can set the exact temperature,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.160]   though I imagine there are much cheaper kettles out there
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.620]   if you don't wanna make tea.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.700]   Next, Trade Coffee.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.980]   Based on the smile that shows up on Amy's face
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.780]   every time she opens up a box from Trade,
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.600]   I am really confident that this would be an amazing gift
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.360]   for anyone who loves coffee.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.600]   Every delivery, they'll get a new curated bag of coffee beans
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.820]   from the top independent roasters all across the country.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.980]   And best of all, you can get up to $50 off gifts
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.300]   at allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.260]   Next is the Coravin.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.420]   There are plenty of nights where Amy or I,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.900]   and probably both of us,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.700]   wanna have a glass of wine with dinner,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.340]   or after the kids go to bed,
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.780]   but we don't really wanna finish an entire bottle.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.120]   So we used to either skip the wine altogether,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.180]   or just end up drinking the entire bottle
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.860]   even though we didn't need to.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.180]   But then we got a Coravin as a gift,
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.780]   and it's changed the way we drink wine.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.380]   It's a device with a small hollow needle
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.100]   that you can stick through the cork of a bottle of wine,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.860]   and it lets you pour out the wine
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.300]   and replaces the space that that wine took up
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.740]   with argon gas, which keeps your wine fresh.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.760]   So you could pour yourself a half a glass
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.620]   or a glass of wine without ruining the bottle,
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.340]   and drink the rest of it days, weeks, or even months later.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.180]   And if you really wanna splurge,
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.920]   my dad got a plum wine dispenser as his retirement gift,
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.620]   which is like a supercharged Coravin machine,
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.620]   where you can put two bottles of wine in,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.340]   and it taps them just like a Coravin machine would,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.540]   and turns it into a dispenser.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.320]   It is amazing, but really expensive.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.900]   Okay, the next one is one of my favorite things.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.420]   If you've ever been to Japan,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.880]   you've probably been fortunate enough
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.740]   to enjoy a Japanese toilet.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.860]   If not, there's a heated seat,
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.660]   heated water bidet, and so much more.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.540]   And despite that some of those toilets
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.420]   can cost thousands of dollars,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.460]   you can actually just get the seat
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.160]   to attach to your current toilet for less than 500.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.600]   I love the Toto Washlet C5.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.260]   We have one in our house,
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.380]   but if you wanna save a little money,
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.900]   you can get the less expensive Washlet C2,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.820]   which we just put in the bathroom we renovated.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.020]   And if you have a Costco membership,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.700]   it's on sale right now through Costco.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.020]   Okay, I feel ridiculous recommending a $40 hand soap,
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.020]   but the Aesop soap we have in our house
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.640]   has gotten more compliments from house guests
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.220]   than just about anything else in the entire home.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.060]   Not to mention, if you haven't used
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.760]   your $50 Amex credit for sacks,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.320]   you can use that to make Aesop soap free,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.280]   which is exactly what I do,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.520]   because I don't think I could actually spend $40.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.080]   But when it comes to gifts,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.440]   I think it's the best hand soap out there,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.240]   and I love it, and it would make a great gift.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   Next is Whiskey River Soap,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.240]   who makes a snarky candle for just about any situation
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.760]   you could ever imagine.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.680]   I've given these to guests who've come on the podcast,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.860]   I've given them to random friends, colleagues,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.260]   they will put a smile on almost anyone's face,
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.660]   and they are one of my go-to gifts
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.620]   if I'm not spending too much.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.180]   Definitely recommend them,
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.900]   you've probably seen them in the newsletter before.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.460]   And in the spirit of food,
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.620]   I have talked about the Paprika app a lot,
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.100]   'cause I think it's the best way to organize recipes
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.880]   and your family meal planning,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.860]   but for an app, it's a bit pricey.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.740]   It's $5 on mobile, $30 on desktop,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.620]   and you have to buy it for every platform you use it.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.980]   But I actually think
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.300]   that it could be a really interesting gift,
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.580]   because not only could you give someone an amazing app,
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.220]   but you could preload it with all of your favorite recipes
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.460]   and share them to whoever you give the app to.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.300]   So it's not only a great app,
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.260]   but it would also be a curated list
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.380]   of all your favorite foods.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   And finally, the Ooni Pizza Oven.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.580]   So we love making pizza at home,
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.180]   and a few years ago, we gave an Ooni Coda
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.500]   to a family member at Christmas, and it was a huge hit.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   Not to mention, it gave us an amazing family activity
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.060]   one night during the holidays,
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.700]   and we were making pizza all night long.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.140]   Definitely makes a great gift for someone.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.000]   Next section is tech, gear, and clothes.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.340]   So I'll start with Viore.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.700]   They make the most amazing performance apparel.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.260]   It's ridiculously comfortable,
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.420]   and seriously, Amy and I probably wear it every single day.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.580]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.100]   but you really can't go wrong with anything they make,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.220]   and you can get 20% off your first order
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.500]   at allthehacks.com/viore, V-U-O-R-E.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.100]   Next is the Blunt Umbrella.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.300]   We bought our yellow Blunt Classic Umbrella six years ago,
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.700]   and it still works as well as it did the day we got it.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.380]   It's also so incredibly wind-resistant.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.100]   I haven't tried their travel umbrella,
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.880]   but it looks like it's gonna rain this week in London,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.080]   and I really wish I had one with me.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.740]   Okay, I know all of you aren't starting a podcast,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.620]   but I wanna suggest a USB microphone,
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.460]   because when I first bought one for the podcast,
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.960]   I ended up actually starting to use it
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.980]   for all my remote work meetings,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.220]   and I got such good feedback from my colleagues
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.460]   on the audio quality.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.580]   I remember someone saying,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.220]   "Wow, your audio sounds so good.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.340]   "It makes everything you say sound so much more believable."
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.800]   And then a few of those colleagues
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.900]   actually bought a microphone themselves.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.980]   So a great starter mic under $100
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.780]   that I used for the whole first year of this podcast
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.060]   was the ATR2100X, but if you want something a little better,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.940]   you can get the Shure MV7,
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.580]   which is what I'm actually recording on right now.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.420]   And if you need an arm to mount it on your desk,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.860]   there are a bunch of cheap ones for 20 or $30 on Amazon.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.820]   They work, I used them early on,
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.060]   but the Rode PSA1 is so much better.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   Okay, next, the M2 MacBook Air.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.180]   It is hard to think of a purchase I made in 2022
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.280]   that was better than upgrading my laptop
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.180]   to the new M2 MacBook Air.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.760]   It's so fast and having 14 plus hours of battery life
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.780]   is absolutely incredible.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.540]   I honestly can't imagine what it would be like
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.620]   to go back to a computer
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.760]   that I have to charge every three or four hours.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.300]   Sure, it's probably more expensive
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.620]   than anyone's planning to spend
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.300]   on a gift this holiday season.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.140]   However, maybe if you have a business
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.700]   and you need to get a few more expenses in
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.820]   before the end of the year,
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.020]   this could be a really great upgrade.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.700]   But in line with the theme of work,
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.740]   with so many of us working from home,
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.380]   one of the luxuries that I really, really appreciate
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.840]   is having a standing desk in my home office.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.260]   They used to be so expensive,
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.380]   but Uplift makes some really reasonably priced desks
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.900]   and they're so well-built.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.600]   I know because my desk is an Uplift desk and I love it.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.280]   Also, I know some companies will even reimburse you
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.880]   for some home office equipment.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.580]   So definitely worth upgrading
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.860]   if you can get it for free from your employer.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.600]   Last in this list is Gooder Sunglasses.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.580]   They are my new favorite sunglasses.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.100]   I got a pair from Wealthfront
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.780]   as company swag and they were so good
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.020]   that I've since bought more for me and Amy
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.340]   and asked them to be a sponsor of the show.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.540]   They're 100% polarized,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.700]   they're lightweight, stylish, comfortable,
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.740]   and best of all, they are only $25.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.480]   My favorites are the OGs,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.380]   but they have so many different styles
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.740]   and what seems like an unlimited selection of colors.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.340]   And you can get free shipping
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.140]   and a 30-day money-back guarantee
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.620]   at allthehacks.com/gooder, G-O-O-D-R.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.580]   Next is Health and Fitness.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.300]   So I know I've mentioned my Oura ring a lot,
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.780]   but it is the one thing that I am always wearing every day
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.620]   to track my sleep, my workouts, my heart rate, and HRV.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.340]   And the Gen 3 ring also tracks blood oxygen levels.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.780]   I've used up all my referrals,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.300]   so I don't have a link for you,
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.340]   but if you know anyone who has an Oura ring,
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.420]   you can use their link to get an additional $50 off.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.660]   Next is the 8 Sleep Pod Cover.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.460]   This is an expensive purchase,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.580]   but traveling just isn't the same
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.020]   now that we've been spoiled by our 8 Sleep Cover at home.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.780]   It not only tracks your sleep,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.860]   but it also automatically heats and cools your mattress
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.780]   in line with your sleep cycles
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.300]   to help improve your deep sleep
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.020]   and improve your overall sleep quality.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.380]   It also warms up your bed right as you're getting into it,
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.140]   which given that every night in London
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.580]   it's been below freezing,
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.620]   would have been a really nice thing to have over here.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.260]   You can use my personal referral link
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.940]   for $200 off at allthehacks.com/8sleep.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.020]   And next is InsideTracker.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.260]   So I think you all know
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.460]   that I love getting data on everything,
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.140]   and that's totally true when it comes to my health,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.060]   and I've been a huge fan of InsideTracker
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.820]   since I started using it earlier this year.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.060]   They take your blood, DNA, and fitness tracking activity,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.700]   and they provide a personalized health analysis
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.780]   and action plan for exercise, nutrition, and supplementation,
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.700]   and I think they do a really good job,
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.140]   and I'm really excited that they're a sponsor of the show,
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.700]   which means you guys can all get 20% off
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.540]   at allthehacks.com/insidetracker.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.220]   Going back to sleep for a minute,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.100]   and you could argue that I should probably put this
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.380]   in the learning section that'll come up next,
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.980]   but since good sleep is so important to your health,
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.020]   I'll put it here.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.620]   And that is the book "Why We Sleep" by Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.420]   It is my favorite book on sleep.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.940]   It really is a collection
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.220]   of so much knowledge on the topic.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.260]   I've been trying to get the author to join me
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.620]   on an episode of the podcast since I started,
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.740]   but the book is so good,
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.140]   it's really everything you need about sleep.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.380]   Last in this category is a Peloton.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.340]   Amy and I love our Pelotons so much,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.420]   and I highly recommend it to anyone
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.140]   who wants to work out at home,
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.460]   even if you're not a cyclist,
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.100]   which I am certainly not and never have been.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.240]   It is such a good workout that gets even better
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.380]   when you have friends to compete with.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.860]   I don't think I've ever been able to push myself.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.740]   Rehearsals for the school play were really coming along.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.620]   Bigger smile, Mr. Squirrel.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.780]   Until a custodian accidentally threw away the costumes.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.900]   Oh no.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.460]   Everyone was rattled.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.100]   Miss Geraghty forgot how to play.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.500]   And the queen of the hedgehogs almost quit.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.180]   Find a new queen.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.700]   But replacement costumes were shipped with FedEx.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.980]   And with added peace of mind
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.380]   from picture-proof of delivery,
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.340]   everyone could focus on the perfect opening night.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.540]   FedEx, where now meets next.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.860]   For residential delivery only.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.460]   As hard as I could,
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.940]   when I'm trying to either beat my friends' records
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.260]   or even my own personal record.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.220]   If you want $100 in free accessories,

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.500]   It's just allthehacks.com/peloton.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.140]   Next category is family and kids.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.100]   And there's a lot in here,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.360]   which is probably indicative of the new stage of my life.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.980]   So first I wanna talk about Love Every.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.580]   We have had a subscription to Love Every
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.220]   since our first daughter was born.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.400]   And I love their products.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.620]   Every few months,
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.620]   they have a subscription that'll send you
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.420]   their award-winning Montessori-inspired toys
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.460]   to your home with a guide for exactly when
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.980]   and how to use them to help your child learn and grow.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.580]   And all their toys are designed
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.740]   by child development experts.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.100]   They're well-built and they're sustainably made.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.260]   If you want $20 off your subscription,
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.700]   you can go to allthehacks.com/loveevery.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.740]   That's my personal referral code.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.940]   Next is StoryWorth, who is sponsoring this episode,
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.260]   but was on the list before I even connected with them.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.380]   If you have ever wanted to capture all the stories
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.740]   and memories from your loved ones,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.540]   this is a great gift.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.700]   Every week for a year,
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.060]   they'll email your loved ones
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.740]   with a single life-related question,
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.980]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.860]   or what's the farthest you've traveled?
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.860]   And then after the year is up,
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.180]   they compile it into a hardcover book
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.940]   with stories, memories, and even photos
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.860]   that you can pass down for generations to come.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.540]   And you can get $10 off at allthehacks.com/storyworth.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.840]   Okay, a few cybersecurity things in here
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.880]   that I think are really important for family.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.660]   First, Delete.me.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.180]   It is crazy how many websites are out there
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.660]   sharing your personal data,
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.460]   your phone number, your home address,
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.580]   your relatives' names, your email, your birthday,
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.900]   and it is so much work to try to get them
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.020]   to take it all down.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.100]   I know, because I tried to do all that work myself,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.900]   and it just wasn't worth it.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.460]   So I started using Delete.me,
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.160]   and they found stuff I couldn't even find myself.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.540]   They do it all for you.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.940]   They remove all of your info
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.260]   from hundreds of data broker websites.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.640]   And while it might not be the most exciting gift
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.400]   in the world, I think it would be an amazing gift
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.440]   for anyone who has never done it.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.000]   Not to mention, you can get $20 off all Delete.me plans
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.500]   at allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.160]   And next, if anyone in your family
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.080]   is not using a password manager,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   I would recommend giving them a membership gift
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.140]   to 1Password.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.000]   Until a few years ago, my parents were using
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.480]   the same passwords for so many different websites,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.080]   so I actually gifted them a 1Password membership
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.480]   and helped them set it up.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.760]   And since then, I feel so much more confident
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.580]   about their cybersecurity practices.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.960]   Another gift we actually gave my dad this year
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.800]   was an Aura photo frame.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.620]   Now, digital photo frames have been around for years,
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.320]   but I've never found one that works as well as Aura.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.200]   It is so easy for you or anyone else in your family
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   to share pictures with the frame that you give someone.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.880]   Between my and Amy's family,
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.240]   I think there are four or five Aura frames
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.680]   in different homes, and it's been so awesome
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.080]   for everyone in the family to be able to share photos
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.240]   with everyone's frames and have them just pop up
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.600]   in our living room.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.240]   The next one's a bit of a strange one,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.600]   but it's the Nugget.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.720]   I'd say it's like part furniture, part toy,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.000]   but all around, it's one of the best purchases
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.460]   we've made for our kids.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.720]   It's almost like a bunch of foam blocks
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.700]   that you can stack on top of each other.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.100]   We use it for story time,
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.440]   we use it to make a slide down the stairs,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.980]   to build forts, and a lot more.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.200]   It looks from their website like they might not arrive
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.840]   by the end of the year if you order now,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.720]   but I'm still including it on the list
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   because I think it would make an amazing gift
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.200]   for any young kid.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.700]   Okay, I love escape rooms,
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.720]   so I think they would make an amazing gift for anyone.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.120]   Amy and I have probably done at least 50 together,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.320]   and we try to find the best room we can
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.980]   in every city we visit.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.160]   So if you're looking for a fun activity for your family,
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.060]   or even a good gift as a gift card,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.680]   I can highly recommend an escape room.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.080]   There isn't an easy way to find the best room in a city
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.420]   other than just searching, looking on Reddit,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.920]   but I did find one site that I linked in the show notes
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.120]   that seems to have pretty good rankings in different cities
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.040]   if you're trying to find the best one.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.640]   But honestly, of the 50 rooms we've done,
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.280]   we've probably only ever done one bad one,
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.080]   so I'd optimize more for doing it
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.880]   than trying to find the best.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.060]   And along the same lines of games,
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.520]   I wanna talk about board games,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.960]   because I love board games,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.880]   and I think they make amazing gifts.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.400]   So I thought I'd share some of my favorites
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.080]   that I think you should all check out.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.240]   I left a few of the obvious ones like Catan off the list,
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.140]   but if you're listening and you have any suggestions for me,
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.320]   please send them my way,
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.300]   because I love collecting new awesome board games.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.760]   So the first one I'll mention is Coup.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.680]   This one's a bit hard to explain,
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.600]   but it is the first game we pull out when friends are over,
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.200]   we take it traveling with us,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.700]   and if you've ever played a game like Werewolves or Mafia,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.400]   you will definitely love it,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.380]   but it does require a bit of bluffing.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.220]   You can play with two to six people,
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.780]   the package is really small so it's easy to travel with,
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.300]   and games are quick.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.720]   Next is Ticket to Ride,
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.380]   and maybe I should have excluded this
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.420]   because I know it's such a popular game,
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.980]   but Amy and I love it so much,
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.500]   I thought it's worth a mention.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.220]   It's two to five players, you can play as a family,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.600]   and unlike some of the other strategy games that I also love,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.820]   this one does not take hours to play,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.580]   which has recently become a requirement
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.740]   for games in our house.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.140]   I hope it's not too soon to talk about this next one,
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.700]   which is Pandemic Legacy Season One.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.380]   It is such an interesting game,
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.860]   I love it because it's so different.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.420]   It's a cooperative game,
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.020]   meaning everyone that's playing it is on the same team
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.140]   and they win or lose together,
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.380]   but Pandemic Legacy, unlike Pandemic itself,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.700]   is really more like a choose your own adventure book.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.020]   You can actually only ever play the game once,
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.800]   you level up characters, it's almost like an RPG game,
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.420]   but in a board game style, and it's so good.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.420]   Two more great ones if you're looking for two-player games
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.500]   are Jaipur and Splendor.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580]   Amy and I really love playing both of them,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.820]   though we have a lot less time for games as we used to.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.580]   If you have a big group, I really love Codenames.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.020]   It's great for groups and can be played quickly,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.940]   and if you're looking for a game to play with a team
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.900]   at a work event or an offsite, I think Codenames is great
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.300]   and we played it a lot at all the companies I've worked at.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.040]   Bonanza is also a fun game that we end up playing
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.580]   around the holidays with family
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.580]   because you can have up to seven players,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.620]   you can play under an hour, and unlike a lot of games,
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.820]   it's really easy to learn the rules.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.140]   Finally, two I don't have,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.140]   but that are really high on my list.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.100]   One is Seven Wonders Duel,
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.100]   which is the two-player version of Seven Wonders,
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.940]   which is a game we have and love.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.700]   I've just heard so many good things about it
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.460]   that I wanted to put it on the list.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.380]   Also, a game that I didn't know anything about
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.780]   until researching this episode yesterday was Wingspan.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.020]   I don't have any interest in birdwatching,
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.620]   but it seems like everyone in the last few years
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.900]   is saying that this game is at the top of their list,
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.340]   so it's something I definitely wanna check out.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.260]   If anyone listening is in my family
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.180]   and is looking for a last-minute gift idea, here it is.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.460]   Okay, the next section of gifts is all about learning.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.380]   If anyone in your family loves to learn,
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.660]   especially learn about money, about travel,
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.860]   about optimizing life, you should obviously recommend
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.760]   that they check out this podcast
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.860]   or the All The Hacks newsletter.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.620]   But another gift when it comes to learning
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.460]   that I think is great, and I can say that
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.020]   with a firsthand experience of giving it as a gift
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.240]   to my father last year, is a membership to Masterclass.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.920]   I could literally spend hours, if I had the time,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.100]   watching all the classes they have.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.980]   There's literally a class for anyone,
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.980]   whether it's related to business or cooking or life
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.340]   or music or even skateboarding.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.720]   And right now, you can get two memberships
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.360]   for the price of one at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.040]   Moving to a few books, which I could probably have
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.160]   a huge list from so many of the awesome people
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.280]   I've interviewed, so there's probably a little bit
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.940]   of recency bias here.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.400]   But I have to start with "Die With Zero."
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.500]   This book and the interview I recently had
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.860]   with Bill Perkins had such a huge impact
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.660]   on the way I think about life and money
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.420]   that it has to be on the list, and I highly recommend it.
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.820]   Next is "The Two Hour Cocktail Party."
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.020]   Not only could you actually use this book from Nick Gray
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.500]   to host an amazing cocktail party during the holidays,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.040]   but I think it would make a great, fun gift
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.140]   or stocking stuffer for anyone.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.020]   Next is "Vagabonding."
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.940]   I've gifted this book more than any book in the world
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.940]   because it had such a huge impact on our lives.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.860]   It's actually the book that led to Amy and I
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.020]   traveling around the world for seven months,
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.900]   so it's hard not to suggest it to anyone who likes travel.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.760]   And finally are any of the Death & Co. cocktail books.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.460]   If you know anyone that likes cocktails
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.660]   or likes books that look great on your coffee table,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.380]   then all of the Death & Co. books
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.140]   would make fantastic gifts,
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.920]   but my favorite is "Cocktail Codex,"
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.680]   which basically breaks the entire world of cocktails
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.620]   down into six root cocktails that once you master,
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.740]   give you kind of the knowledge and skills you need
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.980]   to translate those root recipes
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.800]   into hundreds of different drinks.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.300]   Last is "A Cozy Meal Cooking Class."
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.440]   So we've booked a pasta-making class,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.820]   a donut-making class,
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.660]   and we even did a family Iron Chef challenge
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.100]   all through Cozy Meal,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.660]   and none of them have ever disappointed.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.460]   So if you want a fun gift
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.940]   for someone that lives in one of the cities they operate in,
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.380]   or you live there and you're looking for a cool activity
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.940]   to do over the holidays,
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.540]   I would highly recommend checking out what's on Cozy Meal.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.900]   Finally, the last category for this episode is travel.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.020]   I don't have too many travel gadgets,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.520]   but now that we have kids
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.300]   and we end up checking bags on every single trip,
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.500]   I always make sure to keep an Apple AirTag
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.860]   in every one of our checked bags.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.400]   Fortunately, I haven't had to use them
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.780]   to locate a lost bag,
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.380]   and honestly, I hope I never have to,
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.700]   but it is so comforting to be able to see
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.500]   that your bag made it on the plane,
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.000]   or when you get to your destination,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.660]   see that the bag's coming,
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.980]   or even just know that your bag is en route to the carousel
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.380]   so you're not sitting around waiting,
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.940]   wondering what's going on.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.780]   Next is the Stoke-Aid JetKids Bed Box.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.660]   This was an amazing gift to our daughter
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.500]   from my parents earlier this year,
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.220]   and it's so awesome.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.020]   It's a little suitcase with two extra features
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.760]   that make it the best for flights.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.520]   First, your kid can actually ride the suitcase,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.620]   which means you can cruise through the airport.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.280]   But the most unique feature
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.400]   is that it turns into an elevated platform
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.160]   that can extend the chair your kid is sitting on
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.080]   all the way to the seat in front of them,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.860]   giving them an entire lie-flat, first-class experience.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.420]   And while over 50 airlines have approved it,
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.680]   almost all the major domestic carriers,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.880]   Delta, American, JetBlue, Southwest, Alaska,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.180]   United is notably the exception
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.180]   and say they don't allow it on board,
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.180]   though I have heard that it's not always enforced.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.980]   Another one which we just bought for our trip to Europe
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.780]   that we're on right now is the BabyZen YoYo Stroller.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.920]   It has been awesome.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.700]   It fits in the overhead compartment.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.760]   It feels really sturdy.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.560]   It's easy enough to pick up, even when your kid's on it
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.220]   and you have to walk up and down the stairs
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.300]   at a metro station, at a subway station,
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.060]   and it really holds up value.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.320]   In fact, if you look for a used YoYo Stroller online,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.780]   they're not that much cheaper than buying them new.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.420]   So as long as you take reasonable care of it,
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.700]   I think that you'd be able to get back
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.780]   most of your money in a couple years.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.420]   Another travel thing is Away luggage.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.100]   Amy and I each have an Away carry-on suitcase
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.820]   and they are fantastic.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.140]   I don't know if they still have the option
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.800]   for the integrated battery, but I would skip that.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.660]   But other than that, it's a fantastic suitcase
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.800]   and it happens to be Wirecutter's top pick
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.660]   for a hard-sided carry-on.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.780]   And if you want $20 off, you can use my referral link
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.580]   at allthehacks.com/away.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.500]   And then any of the bags that Dagny Dover makes
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.340]   would make an awesome gift.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.100]   I think Amy's given Dagny Dover bags as gifts
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.260]   to friends and family more than any other gift.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.900]   Her favorites are the Landing Carry-All
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.460]   and the Dakota Backpack.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.340]   And if you want $20 off, Amy's referral link
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.420]   is allthehacks.com/dagnydover,
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.680]   D-A-G-N-E-D-O-V-E-R.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.080]   And finally, the last one, which is a crazy one,
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.680]   but it popped up in my Twitter feed
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.360]   and I thought I had to include it,
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.880]   which is a week on Necker Island.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.440]   So if you're not familiar,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.640]   it's Richard Branson's private island
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.320]   and they finally opened it up
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.100]   and you can book a week with points.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.520]   So if you happen to have 1.7 million points
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.160]   burning a hole in your pocket,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.560]   you are now able to book your week on the private island
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.060]   for free with points.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.920]   I'm sure it would be a fun adventure.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.520]   I'll link to a page in the show notes
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.080]   if you wanna read about it,
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.920]   but realistically, I don't actually expect
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.760]   anyone listening to do this.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.840]   However, if you do, please let me know how it goes.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   I am dying to hear about it.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.380]   So that's all the gift recommendations I have,
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.180]   but there are three things I wanna talk about
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.680]   to help you save money when you're doing
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.520]   any of your shopping this season.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.560]   The first is making sure you use cashback portals.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.720]   I always like to go to cashbackmonitor.com
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.240]   to see what the best way to earn cashback or points is
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.000]   when I'm shopping online.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.480]   However, some of the sites that are listed there
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.380]   are a pain to set up, so more often than not,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.460]   I end up just using Rakuten because it's easier
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.380]   and they let you earn Amex points instead of dollars.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.240]   So if you haven't signed up for Rakuten,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.840]   you should definitely check it out.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.200]   And right now you can get $30 free
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.700]   after your first purchase
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.120]   if you go to allthehacks.com/rakuten.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.000]   The next is finding promo codes, but also using live chat.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.480]   So I feel like it's gotten so hard lately
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.240]   to find a working promo code to use online.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.840]   I used to go to RetailMeNot
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.160]   and almost every code would work,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.900]   but now it seems like every time I try to find a code,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.460]   they all fail.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.980]   So the tactic that I use now is if a site has a live chat,
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.620]   I just message them and ask for a discount.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.160]   I tell them what I'm looking to buy
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.720]   and more often than not,
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.880]   I end up getting some kind of discount.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.280]   Or even one time someone said,
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.800]   "I can't give you a discount, but if you search online,
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.200]   you can find a referral link to get a discount."
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.680]   Like a lot of the referral links I've been sharing here.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.080]   So if you can't find a discount and there's no live chat,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.140]   maybe go to Twitter and search Twitter
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.800]   for the name of the brand and promo code or referral,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.280]   and you might find people sharing their promo codes
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.960]   and their referral links online.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.240]   Finally, and I've talked about this before,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.880]   is getting gift cards.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.200]   So most online retailers don't qualify
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.920]   for bonus points on your credit card.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.840]   I could always use my VentureX and get two points per dollar,
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.560]   but whenever I'm shopping online,
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.280]   I always try to see if I could go buy a gift card
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.680]   for the retailer somewhere where I'd earn more points.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.480]   My two go-tos are buying them at grocery stores
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.000]   where I can get four points with the Amex Gold
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.700]   or buying them on Amazon where I can get 5% back
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.240]   with the Amazon Prime card.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.540]   Or you might actually get a better deal
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.480]   going to a site like Card Cash
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.960]   where you can buy discounted gift cards
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.200]   from people who are trying to get cash for their gift cards
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.320]   'cause they're not actually gonna use them.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.400]   So those are my three favorite tips
