[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   We apologise for the poor quality of the following recording of a sermon
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.400]   by the late Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones. Although we have digitally restored this to improve clarity,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.840]   the quality is not as good as we would like. We do apologise for this, but nevertheless,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.520]   hope that this sermon will be a great encouragement and a blessing to you.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   chapter, most of which we read at the beginning, namely the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:42.880]   chapter 5, verses 29 to 32. Verses 29 to 32, in the fifth chapter of the book of the Acts of the
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.680]   Apostles. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, "We ought to obey God rather
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.840]   than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, for whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:10.240]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour, for to give
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.880]   repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.840]   and so he is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him."
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.680]   Here we are this evening, met together in this chapel on an Easter Sunday evening.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:44.240]   Why are we doing this? Why do we go on doing this Sunday by Sunday,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.000]   preaching this gospel, this message, out of this book which we call the Bible?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.960]   We know that we are but a small minority in this country today, and in every other country.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.040]   The world scoffs at this, and laughs at it, and dismisses it. Why do we go on doing it?
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.920]   Well now, that's the question I want to consider with you tonight, because we have brought face to
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.480]   face with that very question in this chapter, and in particular in these verses which I've now
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.720]   just taken as my text for this evening's sermon. What is this chapter? Well, you've noticed
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.360]   it's really nothing but a very typical picture of the life of the early church.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.640]   It's an account of how these apostles conducted and behaved themselves, how they preached,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.200]   and what they preached, and what happened to them. But in the main, you noticed, it was this.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.880]   It's an account of a struggle which went on between these apostles, these preachers of the gospel,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.360]   and the Jewish authority. From the very beginning, the Jewish authorities tried to stop
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.040]   these men from preaching this gospel. There are accounts of their doing so in the previous chapter.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.960]   They got hold of these men, and they told them that they must preach no more in the name of this
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   Jesus. They said it was wrong, it was blasphemous, and so they prohibited them to do so.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:42.000]   But we find that the apostles went on preaching, and because they continued to do so, they got
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.680]   into trouble. And this time, when they were brought against the authorities, you remember,
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.560]   they were not only reprimanded very severely, but they were taken, and they were thrown and
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   cast into the common prison. The authorities said that this sort of thing must stop,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.880]   that it was wrong, and that this Jesus whom they were preaching, whose name they wouldn't even
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.520]   mention because they hated him so much, was a blasphemer. So they threw them into the common
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.760]   prison. But you remember that suddenly they found the prison doors open, an angel had come and had
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.720]   opened the doors, and they walked out. And the angel also told them to go back and to preach
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.240]   as they'd been doing before in the temple and everywhere else. So they went back into the
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.840]   temple and continued preaching and teaching the people. And then you remember this almost amusing
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.160]   story of how these authorities met together in the morning and told their officers to go and
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.840]   fetch these prisoners, that they really wanted to deal with them in a summary manner at last.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.640]   And you remember how the officers went and they came to the prison.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.000]   When they went into that innermost part of the prison where they'd put these men,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.480]   they suddenly found that they were not there. So they would go back and report that they found the
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.040]   prison intact, but they couldn't find the prisoners. And there was confusion amongst the authorities.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.160]   But the men came and said, "I can tell you where they are. They're back at it again. They're back
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.400]   where they've been all along, in the temple and other places, preaching and teaching in the name
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:40.800]   of this Jesus." So once more, these men were brought before the authorities. And again,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.000]   they were severely reprimanded, as you remember. When they had brought them,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.480]   they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, saying, "Did
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.920]   not we straightly commend you that you should not teach in this name? And behold,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.800]   you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.480]   Then comes the reply of Peter that we are going to consider.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.440]   When they had heard this, we read, they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.720]   to put them to death. But one of their own company, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.440]   who was had in reputation among all the people, he commanded to put the apostles forth for a
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   little space. And then he argued with his own fellow Pharisees and said, "Don't do that." He
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.640]   said, "Wait a minute, let us consider this thing. Refrain from these men and let them alone. For if
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.200]   this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught. But if it be of God, you cannot
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:57.840]   overthrow it, lest happily you may be found even to fight against God." And to him they agreed.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:06.320]   And when they had called the apostles and beaten them, they smote them, they beat them with stripes.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:14.480]   They commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.600]   And what was the reaction of the apostles to that? Well, here it was. And they departed from
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:30.560]   the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:43.040]   And daily in the temple and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.480]   Now, here's the question that confronts us. Why did the apostles do this?
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:57.280]   Why do they fly in the face of the edict of these authorities?
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:06.720]   Why do they take the risk of being beaten again with stripes? Why are they risking their very
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.800]   lives? Because, you notice, the decision of these men was, before Gamaliel persuaded them to give
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.920]   them another chance, their decision was to kill them, to slay them. Well, here are these men who
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.280]   realize that if they continue preaching the name of Jesus Christ, they may very well be put to death,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:33.600]   but who nevertheless cease not from preaching and teaching Jesus in the temple and from house to
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:44.400]   house. What's the explanation? What made them do it? Come, let me ask another question on this
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:52.960]   Easter Sunday evening. Why has the church continued doing this throughout the running centuries?
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.560]   Can you explain to me the story of the martyrs?
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.160]   These men who were told by authorities later in their day and generation,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.720]   if you go on preaching, that gospel will put you to death. But they went on preaching.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.080]   The early Christians, dozens of them were thrown to the lions in the arena. What made them do this?
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.840]   Why go on preaching this message, though they knew that that was to be their fate?
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.600]   How do you explain the story of the martyrs in those first three centuries?
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   How do you explain the martyrs before the Reformation, like John Huss and Wycliffe in
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.720]   this country and others? How do you explain the Protestant martyrs and reformers, so many of whom
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.800]   were put to death here in London and others in Oxford? What was it that possessed these men?
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.240]   Why did they go on preaching and teaching Jesus Christ, though they knew, I say,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.680]   that they'd have to pay for it with their very lives? What made them go on and cease not?
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:14.720]   The answer to that question is given to us in these verses that I'm holding before you this
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.440]   evening. The Apostle Peter has given the answer once and forever.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.360]   And I'm concerned about it, my friends, because here we have the key,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.400]   the secret to the success of the Christian church in all ages of revival and of reawakening.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:40.800]   And it is only as we come back to this and are animated by the same motives and possessed by the
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:50.560]   same spirit that we can justify our existence as Christians and the church can still be worthy of
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:59.520]   the name of the Church of God. Why do we do this? Why did the Apostles do it? Let me answer that
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:07.760]   question. For as I hold before you the reasons that were given by Peter, why he and his fellow
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.320]   Apostles went on, I shall be giving you the reasons that have possessed and influenced men
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.360]   ever since in the long history of the Christian church. Very well, here it is.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.800]   Here is the first reason. The Apostle doesn't hesitate to tell these people that they go on
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:33.600]   doing this because of the nature, the character of the things that they have witnessed.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:43.840]   He said we are witnesses, we are his witnesses of these things. And so also is the Holy Ghost
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:52.080]   whom God has given to them that obey him. You ask me, says Peter, why I and my fellow Apostles go
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   on doing this in spite of your freckles, in spite of all the punishment you've given us,
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.240]   in spite of imprisonment and threatened death? I'll tell you why, says Peter. It's the things
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:15.600]   we have seen and heard. What's he talking about? Well, he's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:25.040]   himself. These men, you see, had been his disciples three years. They had spent their
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:34.320]   days and their nights with him. They'd looked into his eyes, into that face of God, and they'd felt
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.920]   something that they'd never felt before. This man, the speaker, Peter, had been up onto a mountain
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.880]   with him, also James and John being in the company. And there suddenly a cloud had overshadowed them,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.080]   and they felt sleepy, but suddenly they're awake and they see two men speaking to Jesus,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:03.440]   Moses and Elias, and he was suddenly transfigured before them. His very body began to shine,
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.400]   it became luminous. It began to shine with a brightness that no human being can ever produce
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.560]   or has ever seen. And they'd seen it, and they'd heard a voice coming out of heaven and saying,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.680]   "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Hear him." They were witnesses of these things,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.600]   but not only that, they'd heard all his teachings. This carpenter of Nazareth,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.640]   this apparently ordinary man who'd never been trained as a Pharisee, but who could always
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:45.440]   rout the Pharisees in any argument that happened to arise, this man who spoke with such authority
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.800]   and power and who claimed such unique things for himself, they'd heard it all, they'd been with him.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:14:00.400]   And then they'd seen his miracles. The blind receiving their sight, the lame walking,
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.480]   the deaf being made to hear, the lepers being cleansed, yea, the dead raised. They were there,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:18.080]   they saw it. They were there. One afternoon walking with him out of a city and suddenly
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.440]   they were into a city and suddenly they met a procession coming out of the city, a funeral
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:33.760]   procession. And lying on the pier was the dead body of a man, the only son of his widowed mother,
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:41.200]   the widow of Nain. And suddenly they'd seen our Lord stopping the procession
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.080]   and addressing the dead and raising him. They'd seen it. They were witnesses of it.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.360]   Peter and James and John were with him on the occasion in Jairus's house
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:00.000]   when he suddenly took hold of the hand of that dead child, 12 years old, and said,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   "Talitha cummi," which being interpreted means "maiden," I say, "unto thee arise."
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.640]   And they'd seen us sitting up and beginning to eat.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.800]   They were with him on that occasion when a message came to tell him
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:23.200]   that his friend Lazarus was desperately ill and at the point of death. Oh, they were with him
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.960]   when another message came to say that Lazarus was already dead. And they'd gone with him to
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:36.320]   that cemetery and they'd stood there with him and they'd heard him shouting, "Lazarus, come forth!"
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:48.560]   And Lazarus, who'd been dead four days, came forth. They'd seen these things. They were witnesses.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.040]   They were there. "We're witnesses of these things," says the apostle, "Oh, but it doesn't stop there,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:03.200]   does it?" They were amazed at all this and they said, "This is undoubtedly the Messiah
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.800]   that is going to restore the kingdom to Israel." But ah, they had seen something else happening.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.600]   They couldn't understand it. They were baffled and bewildered.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   They saw him insisting upon going up to Jerusalem. They tried to stop him. They'd heard that Herod
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   was determined to kill him. They did their utmost to dissuade him. He wouldn't listen.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.760]   He set his faith steadfastly to go to Jerusalem and they went with him.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:34.400]   And their astonishment and amazement. He seemed to be quite helpless suddenly.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.880]   He said nothing in self-defense. He allowed them to arrest him. They couldn't understand it.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.760]   Peter tried to defend him with a sword. He told him to put it by. He seemed to be so weak suddenly.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:55.360]   And they saw him arrested and scourged and smitten and a crown of thorns pressed upon his holy brow.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.040]   They saw him staggering under the weight of a cross until he was relieved by Simon of Cyrene.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:12.640]   And they saw him nailed to the cross and die in apparent that of weakness and complete helplessness.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:21.040]   They heard his cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" They heard him saying into thy hands,
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.000]   "I commend my spirit." They saw him giving up the ghost and dying.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.160]   They were there when his body was taken down from the tree and put into a grave.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.960]   They saw the stone rolled over the face of the grave. They saw the seal put upon it and the
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.760]   soldiers put there to guard it and to watch it. They'd seen all this. They were there.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:57.280]   But they'd seen something that had shaken them again to their very foundation. What was it?
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.440]   Well, they were the men who'd been running, you remember, on the morning of the third day.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.280]   Certain women came to them and said, "Look here," they said, "we've been to the cemetery.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.320]   We've looked there, into the tomb, and he's not there." "What?" they said, and John and Peter ran.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:21.760]   Peter and John had been there together. They'd looked into the tomb and they'd seen it empty
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:28.880]   and they'd gone into it. And they'd seen the cross, but no body. He'd gone. He'd risen
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:36.000]   from the grave and from the dead. And then, you see, they'd been present and they were eyewitnesses
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.920]   of his many appearances to them. All of them were going to a place called Emmaus
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.280]   and were miserable and unhappy and said, "We thought, after all, that he was to be the Christ
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.600]   and the Messiah, but he was crucified in weakness and died." And suddenly a stranger joined them
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.800]   and said, "What is this conversation? And why are you so sad and miserable?" And they told him the
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.440]   miserable story. And then he was going to leave them. They said, "Wait with us. It's getting late.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.880]   Stay with us." And he went with them. And there they began to break bread. And suddenly they knew
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:20.240]   him, Christ, the risen Christ, had appeared to them. They were all together apart from one of
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.080]   them called Thomas. Another occasion, in a room, the doors were shut and locked because they were
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.520]   afraid of the Jewish authority. Suddenly, Jesus had stood in their midst. They were there. They'd
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   witnessed it. He'd spoken to them. He'd said, "Look at me. I'm not a ghost." He'd eaten fish
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.520]   and broiled honey in their presence. He'd said, "Touch me. Feel me. Realize that I'm risen in the
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:52.080]   body." They were there. They'd witnessed it. Peter and John and some of the others, on one
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.440]   occasion, were again feeling rather dejected and downcast. And Peter said suddenly to the company
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:04.240]   in the evening, "I'm going to fish." He was an old fisherman. He said, "I'm going back to do
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.360]   some fishing." And they went with him. And they toiled all night and didn't catch a thing.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.720]   Suddenly in the morning, as the dawn was breaking, they saw some person standing on the seashore
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.120]   and giving them instructions, saying, "Throw the net on the right-hand side and you'll catch."
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:30.480]   And they did so, and they caught 153 fish. And yet their net didn't break. And they looked again,
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   and they said, "It's the Lord!" And Peter jumped into the sea as he was and swam to him.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.800]   The others came in the boat, and there he spoke to them and addressed them. Indeed,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:47.920]   he'd been cooking a breakfast full of fish on a fire which he'd made there upon the sand.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.200]   And then they'd all been with him. Yet later on,
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:21:00.320]   and he had spoken to them, and he had addressed them, and then he took them to a mountain
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.040]   outside Jerusalem. And as they were there standing and talking to him,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:12.160]   he suddenly began to ascend. And they saw him ascending into the heaven,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.840]   even as they stood there. And an angel had come and had said to them, "This Jesus
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:28.640]   shall so come again, even as you've seen him going. Go back to Jerusalem and wait for his
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:35.440]   instructions." Now these men, I say, as Peter reminds these authorities, they were witnesses
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:41.920]   of all these things. And back they'd gone to Jerusalem, and there they'd waited in an upper
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.480]   chamber. He'd told them to wait. He said, "Look here, I want you to go and tell the world about
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.400]   me and about these things." But not yet, he said. "Wait until you're given power. Wait until the
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.240]   Holy Ghost comes upon you." He'd already spoken about the Holy Ghost. He had already told them
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.960]   that he was going to send him upon them. He said, "Wait and he'll come." And they were all together
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.800]   in an upper room, 120 of them, on a morning, on a Sunday morning called the day of Pentecost,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:16.080]   when suddenly there was a mighty sound like of a rushing wind, and cleaving tongues of fire
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.920]   descended upon them all, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.680]   tongues. They were in the company. They were witnesses. They were eyewitnesses. They were
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:37.840]   first-hand witnesses of all these things. "You ask me why we go on preaching this name," says Peter,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:45.040]   "that's the answer. Do you think that anybody who's seen these things can keep quiet? Could you keep
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.640]   quiet if you'd been there? We are witnesses of these things. We want to tell everybody about him
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.880]   and about these things." They'd seen them. They were living eyewitnesses of them.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.960]   Our yes and that which had happened to them on the day of Pentecost
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.840]   had given them a new understanding about it all.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.400]   Indeed, our Lord himself, after his resurrection, had explained it to them.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.520]   You read the 24th chapter of Luke's Gospel when you go home, and you'll find that he took them
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.280]   through the scriptures. He took them through the law, and the Psalms, and the prophets,
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:31.200]   and showed himself to them everywhere. He proved to them that all these things were written about
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.040]   him, that he was the long-promised Messiah, and they were beginning to get it. But then came this
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.760]   baptism of the Holy Spirit, and they saw it all. They understood, and they loved him, and they
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.160]   revered him, and they saw, as Peter says, that God had exalted him and had made him a prince.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:01.280]   What does that mean? Well, that means this. They saw at last what even they had been so
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.680]   slow to see in his days in the flesh, that this Jesus of Nazareth, the carpenter,
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:14.160]   was none other than the only begotten, everlasting, and eternal Son of God,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.520]   who had humbled himself and had come down to do a work for mankind, and had gone back again
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.680]   and was now seated at the right hand of God. God had exalted him and had made him a prince,
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:37.040]   which means a governor, a leader, a ruler, which being interpreted, you see, means this. He'd
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:45.680]   explained it to them. One of his last words to them had been this, "All power is given unto me
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:54.720]   in heaven and in earth." God had made him a prince. God had put this world into his hands,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:01.040]   all its affairs, its destiny, its future, its peoples, its everything. Well, in his hands,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.080]   he's a prince. They'd seen that. They'd come to understand it.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:13.280]   Indeed, they'd come to understand something else, and that is that God had made him
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:20.160]   not only the moral governor of the universe, but had appointed him to be the judge of the world.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:27.920]   They all said that. Peter says it. The apostle Paul says in preaching at Athens,
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:39.120]   that God hath given assurance of the judgment to come in the name of Christ in this way,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:47.600]   that he hath raised him from the dead, a prince. And they had come to understand all this,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:54.240]   and so they told the authorities, "We can't refrain. We must. He's the son of God. He's
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.680]   the ruler of the universe. He's the prince." We are witnesses of these things.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.440]   We accompanied with the son of God when he was here on earth as a man,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.360]   and we want to tell you that he is the son of God,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:18.880]   and that your destiny and the destiny of the whole world is in his hands. That's his first reason.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.400]   But it wasn't his only reason.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.400]   We, he says, are witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.720]   whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:44.000]   "Why are you preaching?" said these people to Peter. Peter says in reply,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.680]   "We are preaching as we are because we've seen these amazing, astounding things,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.160]   and we can't contain ourselves, but more, we are driven by a power.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.520]   There is an energy that has come into us since that day of Pentecost.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.320]   We don't know ourselves. We are transformed. We are transfigured. We are filled with a heavenly
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.600]   joy and a peace we've never known before. We are in touch with him, and he speaks to us,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.560]   and he manifests himself to us, and we are driven. He's commanded us. He's sent us.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:22.800]   We cannot but speak of the things which we have seen and have heard.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.280]   We are being borne along by an unseen power. There is a mighty energy that's entered
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.240]   into our very constitutional being. We can't refrain. We must."
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.120]   That was his second reason.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.400]   But then he has a third reason, he tells us.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:52.320]   And that is that God has commended them to do this, and they're afraid of God and afraid not to do it.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.800]   Listen, Peter and the other apostles answered and said,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:04.880]   "We ought to obey God rather than men," by which he means this.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:11.280]   He says, "We're not disputing but that you are authorities and that you've got power.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.320]   You are heads of government, and in a sense we're in your hands,
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:24.800]   and we do respect you, and we fear you, but we fear God more. We ought to obey God
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.560]   rather than men, and God has commended us to go on preaching."
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:36.240]   Why did they thus fear God? Oh, I've already given you the answer in the sense.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:46.800]   "Yes," says Peter, "the God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:56.240]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand." And the right hand of God always stands for the power of
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:05.680]   God, and the might of God, and the irresistible force of God. "God," he says, "hath exalted him
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:15.360]   with his right hand." And they were eyewitnesses of this power of God. Where had they seen it?
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.560]   Well, they'd already seen it, you see, in the resurrection.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:29.920]   They knew that Christ had died. They'd seen him dying. They'd watched him expiring upon the cross.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   There was no question about his death. That was absolutely certain. At last he'd been mastered
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:46.000]   and conquered by a power, but then he'd risen. Here was a power that was greater than the power
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.600]   of the Jewish authorities that were threatening them. Ah, yes, they respected them and were
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:58.720]   afraid of them, but they were more afraid of God. Here is a power that can countermend the action
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.960]   of the Jewish authorities. They slew him. God raised him.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:12.560]   They were eyewitnesses of the fact that God's power is even greater than the power of death,
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:18.320]   even greater than the power of the grave.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:25.120]   Ah, yes, it's one thing to be afraid of men, but here is one above men,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.120]   master even of death and the grave, to which all men are subject.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:39.920]   We ought to obey God rather than men. We dare not stop, they say, the power of God,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.240]   and he's commended us. They'd seen it at the resurrection. They'd seen it on the day of
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.440]   Pentecost. They'd felt it. They were filled with it. They'd seen the walls of the house shaking
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:59.040]   when the Spirit came and filled the place. They'd just seen it in the case of Ananias and Sapphira,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.840]   a man and a woman who thought they were very clever,
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.920]   but promised to give all their possessions but kept back apart. And they'd seen Ananias
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.680]   suddenly dropping dead, and then in a few hours Sapphira dropping dead. What's this, the power of
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:30.160]   God? They'd also seen it in the prison the previous evening. The Jewish authorities had power and
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.080]   authority to throw them into the common prison. Yes, but God had power to send an angel to open
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:47.920]   the gates, and out they'd gone, the power of God. That was why they said they went on preaching,
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:55.120]   because they dare not disobey God. We ought to obey God rather than men, they say.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:01.200]   And even Gamaliel, you see, understands a little bit about it. He says to his fellow governors,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.640]   "Be careful," he says, "if this is of men it'll come to naught, but if it be of God you cannot
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.600]   overthrow it, lest happily you be found even to fight against God. Be careful," he said to his
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   fellow members of the Sanhedrin. "Don't put yourselves against God, because God is God,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.840]   and when you're fighting God, you're fighting the Lord of the universe. Be careful."
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.760]   We ought to obey God rather than men.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:43.600]   That's why we are preaching, says Peter, and later on another preacher called Paul
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.280]   says the same thing in writing to the church at Corinth. Listen to him saying it,
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:58.800]   "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. Yes," he says, "we must all appear
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   before the judgment seat of Christ and give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:14.000]   good or bad. Therefore, knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." That's why I'm preaching.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.880]   I've got to stand before the judgment seat of Christ and give an account of my life in this
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:25.680]   world. "Therefore, knowing the terror of the Lord, this Christ whom God has exalted to be a prince,
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.160]   we persuade men."
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:39.680]   We ought to obey God rather than men, and that is what every martyr has ever said throughout
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:45.440]   the centuries. They were told in the early days to say, "Caesar is Lord now." They said, "We won't
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.200]   say it. If you don't," said the authorities, "we'll throw you to the lions and you'll be trampled."
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.520]   The Protestant fathers were told, "Stop, or we'll burn you at the stake."
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:05.840]   It made no difference to them. They all said with Paul, "Knowing the terror of the Lord,
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:14.000]   we persuade men." Do you remember the word of the Lord Jesus to his disciples when he said,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.080]   "Fear not them that kill the body, but after that have nothing that they can do.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:26.720]   But rather, I say unto you, fear him that hath power to destroy both soul and body in hell."
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:33.360]   "Yea," I say unto you, "fear him." That's why we are preaching, said Peter.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.200]   We've seen these amazing things, and we want everybody to know about them.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.400]   We are moved by the Spirit, and God has commended, and we dare not disobey him.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:49.360]   But, you know, there was one other thing that made them go on,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.840]   and this is the most amazing and remarkable thing of all.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:03.200]   And that was their concern for these very Jewish authorities who were threatening them,
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.800]   and even threatening them with death. They were concerned about them and about their souls.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.520]   So they go on preaching, and Peter here, even in their presence, is preaching to them.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.720]   "Stop preaching in this name," says the authorities.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.480]   Peter says, "Look here, the God of our fathers raised up Jesus,
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.080]   whom ye slew and hanged in a tree." And he's preaching to him.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.560]   "Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.800]   for to give repentance and remission of sins." He's preaching to him.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:40.960]   Why? Well, it is because of their concern for the souls of these men.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.520]   What do I mean? Well, I mean something like this.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:55.280]   They went on preaching because they understood the terrible plight and position
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:05.120]   and condition of these men. "I'm preaching to you," said Peter, "because you don't know
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.760]   what you've done, and you don't know the danger in which you're placed at this moment.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:17.360]   You have failed to recognize Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:24.160]   You called him a blasphemer. You said, 'Who is this fellow?' You instigated the mob to cry,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.880]   'Away with him! Crucify him!' You rejected him. You spat upon him. You scourged him.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.040]   You mocked him and jeered at him. You slew him. You hanged him on a tree. You made him a curse.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:45.920]   And you've even since then refused to believe our testimony
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:55.760]   about the empty grave and his rising again. You refuse to listen to God's command to repent
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:02.880]   and to believe on him. You're disobeying God. You're resisting the power of God and his almighty
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:13.280]   strength." "We are preaching," said Peter, "because you and the people who've listened to you
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:23.840]   are under the wrath of God. You don't realize it. You don't know it. You're blind. You're mad.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:30.000]   You're insane. You don't realize that you're under God's eye and that you've disobeyed him.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.520]   You've resisted him. You've refused to honor his only begotten Son. You've gone on living as if
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.800]   his Son had never come into this world, and you don't know that you'll go to hell if you persist
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:50.880]   like that. The wrath of God is upon you, and you don't know it. That is why we are preaching."
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:58.080]   The same Peter was preaching, you remember, on that day of Pentecost, and that is what he'd said
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:06.720]   to the people, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation." "Make haste," he said, "God is judging
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:12.800]   the world. He sent his Son, and the world has rejected him and crucified him and won't believe
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:22.080]   in him, and God's wrath will descend upon such." "That is why we preach," says Peter,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:30.400]   "and that is why I'm preaching, my dear friend, to you at this moment,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:40.400]   and that is the message of this day, that God hath exalted him and made him a prince.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:47.200]   Everything is in his hands. He is to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:53.520]   As certainly as we're in this chapel at this moment, this Jesus who was crucified on Good
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:00.880]   Friday, buried, but who rose on Easter morn, and who then ascended forty days later into heaven,
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:07.760]   and is seated at God's right hand, will come back. He'll come back riding the clouds of heaven,
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.800]   and he'll come back to judge the world in righteousness, and you will have to face him,
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.160]   and you'll have to stand before him, and give an account of your life, and tell him why you
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.480]   didn't believe in him, and why you went on living as if he'd never come at all.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:33.360]   "That's why we preach," says Peter. They were concerned about the condition of these people,
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:40.080]   and they wanted to tell them the most wonderful thing that men could ever hear,
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.640]   that the same Jesus whom God had exalted with his right hand to be a prince,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:58.000]   had also been exalted to be a savior, that even they could be saved if they but believed in him.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.200]   They who condemned him to death and had spat in his face, they could be saved. He's a savior.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:16.560]   God, they said, sent his only son into this world to seek and to save that which was lost.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:25.040]   He didn't come to blast mankind. He didn't come to destroy it. He came to save it.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:32.480]   God sent him as the savior, and you see, says this apostle, we are preaching because we want people
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.440]   to know that. We want them to realize their danger in sin, but we want them to know about
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:44.160]   the savior. As Paul puts it, not only does he say, "Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men,"
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   he also says, "The love of Christ constraineth us." I'm driven, he says, by the love of Christ,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.920]   the Christ who died for his enemies, died for the men who've crucified him, died for the men
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.400]   who've blasphemed him. The love of Christ is driving me on. Men hate me. Men throw me into
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:12.800]   prison, but I'm preaching still. Why? I want them to be saved, and they can be saved. He's even loved
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:28.240]   them, exalted not only to be a prince, but also a savior. So they couldn't be stopped because
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.320]   they wanted to tell people these things, that this Jesus, to whom these amazing things had happened,
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:40.960]   was not only son of God, but was the savior of the world, that God so loved the world that he gave
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:48.480]   his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:55.120]   So Peter says finally, "I must go on because I want to tell you about the character of the salvation."
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:06.640]   What is it? It's this. He has got a salvation to give. He is a prince and savior for to give
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:17.440]   repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sin. Oh, this is the most wonderful thing of all.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:25.360]   He offers salvation as a free gift. He comes to the sinner, died with the deepest dying of sin,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.440]   and tells him that he's died for him. He gives it him as a free gift.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.680]   The message is so glorious, says Peter, who can refrain? I'm not asking men to pull themselves
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.240]   up by their bootlaces. I'm not asking a man to save himself to make himself a Christian.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:48.960]   I know that no man can. I've come to tell you of God's free gift in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:55.600]   And what he gives is repentance, which means this.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:05.360]   He, by the Holy Spirit, enables a man to see himself as a sinner and as his terrible, awful
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.640]   plight. You haven't seen that? Well, Christ alone can make you see it, and he makes you see it by
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.920]   his Spirit. You say, "I'm not interested in your Easter Sunday. It means nothing to me." If it
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:22.480]   doesn't, I'll tell you why. It's because you don't realize that you are a sinner. It's because you
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.920]   haven't faced the fact of your death. It's because you haven't visualized yourself on your deathbed.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.360]   It's because you haven't seen yourself after death in the judgment facing this Christ. You
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.640]   don't realize it. You don't know it. But he'll enable you to do so. He'll give repentance,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.240]   and he'll fill you with a sense of terror and alarm. You'll say, "What can I do? Where can I
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.000]   turn?" Like the men on the day of Pentecost, you'll cry out, "Men and brethren, what must I do?"
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.480]   And the answer will come back, "Repent," which means that having realized all this, you go to
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:05.440]   God at once and acknowledge how blind you've been, what a fool you've been, how you've disobeyed God
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:11.200]   and spurned his vice, and have followed your own way, and haven't believed in his Son, and have
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.640]   used Christ as an oath, and have never worshipped him, and have never gloried in him. You'll
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   acknowledge it all with shame and tears, and cast yourself upon his mercy.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:32.320]   And then, having given you that repentance, he will give you remission of sins. He'll tell you,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:39.920]   "Ah, you're right. You're seeing yourself now as you are, as a hell-bound and a hell-deserving
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:48.800]   sinner. But you're not going there. I came into the world in order to deliver you from that.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:57.840]   I came into the world in order to taste death for you. I took your sins upon myself on that cross
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:04.240]   on Calvary's hill. I died the death that you should have died. I've borne your punishment,
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:12.880]   and because of that, God forgives you freely. Remission of sins. He gives it as a gift.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.480]   He tells you that whatever you've been until this minute, he'll blot it all out. He'll cast
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:24.640]   it into the sea of his forgetfulness. Your sins are remitted. The ledgers are struck out. The
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:31.360]   account is cleared, and he'll give you his own life and his own righteousness. Repentance
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:44.160]   and remission of sins. He will tell you that you need no longer fear death and the grave
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   and the judgment beyond it, because he himself is the judge,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:57.680]   and he has died for you and paid your account to the uttermost Father.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:11.360]   "That is why we preach," said Peter, "you rulers of Israel have disobeyed God, and you're under
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:18.640]   his wrath, and nothing awaits you but hell, and there is only one who can save you, that Jesus,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:28.000]   whom you slew and hanged upon a tree, but whom God has exalted to be a prince and a savior.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:36.160]   Neither is there any other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:43.120]   Believe on him," says Peter. Repent and believe. That was his message.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:59.920]   And my dear friend, the message is still the same. God commands all men everywhere to repent
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:12.400]   and to believe on the name of his only begotten son. Have you obeyed God?
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   Have you obeyed God? Have you repented? Have you realized what a vile sinner you are,
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:32.080]   how you've sinned against God and deserve hell and are going to hell? Have you realized it?
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:38.960]   Have you confessed it? Have you realized that Jesus of Nazareth is the son of God,
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.640]   who came into this world to save you, and who at the end of the ages will be the judge of the
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   universe? Have you realized it? Have you believed it? God commands you to believe it. Have you
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:59.440]   bowed your knees before this blessed Jesus and said, "My Lord, my God"? Have you given yourself
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:10.080]   to him? Are you resting upon his perfect work? God commands you to do that. Are you like these
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:17.360]   Jewish authorities that refuse? Or are you like these apostles who say, "We ought to obey God
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:31.920]   rather than men"? I beseech you this evening. Realize the position. It's no use your saying,
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.960]   "Oh, well, I'm not frightened by that kind of thing. I'll turn my back upon this Jesus and go
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   my own way. I'll get rid of him." Fool! The message of the resurrection is answering you.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.720]   You can't get rid of Jesus Christ. The Jewish authorities thought they could,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:57.760]   and they thought they had, when they slain him and buried him and put a stone on the seal
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.080]   of the soldiers, but out he came and faced them again through the apostles.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:11.680]   You'll never get rid of Jesus Christ. Do what you will. Turn your back on him.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:17.280]   Go to the ends of the earth. Do everything. But he'll come back and back and back,
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.760]   and at the end you'll have to face him. Every eye shall see him.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:34.800]   Yea, and they that have slain him, you can't evade him. He's been exalted by God to be a prince.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:41.760]   He's the governor of the universe. He's the judge of the world. And do what you will, I say,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.880]   and hate me as you like. You can't get away from him. You'll have to come back to him,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:53.200]   and there you'll stand before him. Every eye shall see him.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:50:03.360]   And you'll be in one of two companies. Either in the company of those who seeing him will rejoice
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.920]   in him and glory in him and be turned into his same image and be like him, or like unto those
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.760]   who will say to the rocks and to the mountains, "Fall upon us and hide us from the wrath of the
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:26.400]   Lamb." It's a tremendous thing, this, my friends, and I speak with a due sense of the solemnity of
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:35.040]   the situation. It is my humble privilege to repeat to you the words of the Apostle Peter,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:46.960]   "We are to obey God rather than men." Are you obeying the newspapers and their clever writers
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:53.680]   with all their sneers and their jeers? Are you obeying men if you are in the light of these
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.400]   things that these apostles have witnessed? I say, there's only one thing to say of you, you're a fool.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:18.880]   Obey God, repent, and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.480]   Amen.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:29.840]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
