[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   the upside of a school that costs money, a private school,
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.240]   or if there's a charter school that has fees,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.240]   is worth putting yourself into debt and all that.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.520]   So let's just put that aside.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.880]   But then if you do have the resources, are they worth it?
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.540]   It would really come down to, well, what is the trade-off?
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.680]   Is this you have so much money under the sun,
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.040]   you know, that trade-off is
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.720]   whether you leave more inheritance,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.240]   or is this you can't take vacations as a family?
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720]   And I think that's gonna be so different for every family
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.800]   that it's really hard to give a blanket statement.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.520]   I think you are probably going to get
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.920]   more personalized education for your children
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.960]   at a private school.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.240]   But I will say in some parts of the country where I grew up,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.080]   there was like a gifted and talented program.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.160]   In some parts of the country,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.360]   there are magnet schools and charter schools
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.640]   that are part of the public program.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.360]   And so if your child is struggling or really excelling,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.880]   you might not get anything to support that
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.160]   as much at a public school.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.700]   There's probably more resources for people
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.000]   who are a little bit behind than people who are ahead,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.560]   at least in our school district from what we've learned.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.680]   And I think at the end of the day, there are so many options for something in the middle
