[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.320]   - Good Friday morning.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.280]   Thanks for joining us again on the podcast.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.640]   Here's the question.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.260]   The question today, are my eternal rewards
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.840]   and my eternal inheritance the same thing?
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.720]   One seems to imply that we can get more, our rewards.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.400]   The other seems more static and more out of our hands,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.720]   our inheritance.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.940]   So are these rewards and our inheritance different things
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.800]   or are they the same thing?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440]   A perceptive question as always
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.840]   from our perceptive APJ listeners
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.480]   and particularly one from a listener named Nathan
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.080]   who lives in Schenectady, New York.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.440]   Pastor John, I have read and really enjoyed your book,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.760]   "Reading the Bible Supernaturally."
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.400]   I believe my question is the beginning fruit
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.520]   of a deeper grace to look long
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.720]   and linger over passages of scripture.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.000]   That's wonderful.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.260]   My question is on 1 Peter 1, 4.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.040]   There the apostle refers to an inheritance
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.640]   which is reserved for us in heaven.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.360]   This got me thinking about Matthew 6, 20
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720]   where Jesus commands us to lay up
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.400]   for yourselves treasures in heaven.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800]   My question is about the relationship
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.920]   between the inheritance Peter refers to
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.000]   as being reserved for us right now
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640]   and the treasure Jesus tells us
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.900]   to lay up for ourselves over time.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.000]   One seems static, the other dynamic.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.480]   Are they the same thing?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.320]   Are they different?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.440]   And if they are different, how do they relate?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   This is a great question.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.680]   I love this kind of question
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.300]   because it makes me try to relate different parts
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.880]   of scripture to each other
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.840]   to see how they might illumine each other.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.520]   And I've never in my life that I can remember
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   tried to connect these two verses.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.760]   And so it was a very, very challenging
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   and encouraging question for me.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.760]   So Nathan is asking about the possible relationship
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.560]   between 1 Peter 1, 3, and 4,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.600]   which says God caused us to be born again
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   to a living hope through the resurrection
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.960]   of Christ from the dead to an inheritance.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.420]   That's a key phrase.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.640]   To an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.240]   unfading, kept in heaven for you.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.000]   And then Matthew 6, 19 says,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.160]   do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.360]   where moth and rust destroy
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120]   and where thieves break in and steal,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.120]   but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.760]   where neither moth nor rust destroys
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.080]   And the difference between these two texts
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.960]   that stands out is that the inheritance in 1 Peter
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   seems to be fixed, settled, glorious, firm,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.160]   already in existence without any laying up on our part.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.320]   It says imperishable, undefiled, unfading,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.380]   kept in heaven for you.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.000]   Now that's a settled, glorious reality.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.160]   Peter says that the way we come into that inheritance
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   is that God causes us to be born again for it,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   born again to it, born again into it.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.400]   God caused us to be born again to an inheritance,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.800]   for an inheritance kept in heaven.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.360]   So there's no emphasis in this text at all
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   on something we do in order to bring about the inheritance.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.640]   The idea of living so as to lay it up
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.040]   is not in this text in 1 Peter.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.080]   We are born again by virtue of the new birth.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.240]   We believe on Christ.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.200]   Believing on Christ, we are united to the son of God.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.080]   We are sons of the living God.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.920]   We are heirs of God because he's our father.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   That's a closed, done, complete, glorious thing.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   Now, on the other hand, the words of Jesus in Matthew 6
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.160]   tells us to be about the business of doing things
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.200]   that lay up treasures in heaven for us.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.360]   In other words, there's a correspondence
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.520]   between what we do here in this life
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.700]   and the treasures that we will enjoy in heaven.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.960]   So what sorts of things does Jesus have in mind
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.480]   when he says that, that we should be doing
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.640]   that bring about treasures in heaven?
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.560]   And one answer comes from Matthew 19, 21,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.200]   where Jesus says to the rich young ruler,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.160]   who's very reluctant to give up his riches,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.280]   "Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   and you will have treasure in heaven."
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.000]   You do that, you'll have treasure in heaven,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.400]   and come, follow me.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.600]   In other words, open the hand
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.120]   that is clutching your wealth so tightly.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   Open your hand, let your wealth drop on the poor,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.000]   and take my treasure, take me, take me as your treasure.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.560]   You can't serve two masters.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.960]   I'm here, the greatest treasure in the world.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.560]   Let go and take me.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.400]   That's what they gotta do,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.600]   and the poor are served in the process.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.960]   And then Luke 12, 33 makes the same point
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.880]   that selling your possessions and giving to the needy
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.160]   is the way you provide treasures in heaven.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.240]   It says, this is Luke 12, 33,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.880]   "Sell your possessions, give to the needy,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.960]   and thus," I'm adding the words and thus,
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.400]   'cause I think it's so plain,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.080]   "Provide yourselves that way with money bags
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.240]   that do not grow old,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.880]   and with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.560]   where no thief approaches and no moth destroys."
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   So if we just compare 1 Peter 1, 4 to Matthew 6, 20,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.240]   we see that in one of them,
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.240]   our future as Christians is a fixed, settled treasure,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.840]   an inheritance that exists in heaven for us
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.920]   simply by virtue of our being born again into God's family.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.560]   We are children of God by new birth,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.080]   and therefore we're heirs of God.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.480]   And that doesn't come into being
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.600]   because we're generous.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.320]   In fact, it works just the other way around.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.400]   We are able to be radically generous and risk-taking
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   because we have such a treasure in heaven by faith.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.600]   And we can see that, for example, in Hebrews 10, 34,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.720]   "You had compassion on the prisoners,
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.400]   and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   because you knew you yourself have a better life."
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.080]   A better possession and an abiding one.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   But Matthew 6, 20 and 19, 21 and Luke 12, 32 and 33,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.360]   they teach that the generosity we show
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   does in fact lay up treasures in heaven.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.320]   Now, at first, these two emphases,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   the one in Peter and the one in Jesus' teachings
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.720]   seem to be at odds.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.640]   And I can think of three possible ways
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.360]   to resolve this apparent tension.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   One, the first one is to say that the treasures
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.640]   of Matthew 6 and the inheritance of 1 Peter
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.000]   are totally different things.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.520]   So the inheritance is not conditional
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.200]   upon any particular generous way of life,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.400]   but the treasures are conditional
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.080]   upon a generous way of life.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.440]   No conflict 'cause they're totally different realities.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   Another possible resolution would be to say
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.240]   that the treasures laid up in heaven
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.440]   and the inheritance kept in heaven are the same reality,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.120]   and both are conditional.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.320]   And that does not hinder the fact
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.640]   that the inheritance is settled and firm and sure
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.800]   because God will see to it that all his children
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.320]   do in fact live generous lives
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.880]   because they are born again.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   So the treasures and the inheritance are conditional,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.440]   but they are not uncertain because of that.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.320]   That's the second possible way to resolve them.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   The third would be to say that the treasures laid up
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.840]   in heaven and the inheritance, yes,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.760]   refer to the same reality,
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.520]   but that Jesus is calling attention to the fact
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.400]   that there will be a variation
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.960]   in the way different Christians experience
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.920]   the fullness of their inheritance.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.800]   In other words, every Christian will receive
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.360]   the inheritance of eternal life,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.040]   but there will be different rewards
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.760]   within that inheritance for the way we have lived our lives.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.840]   Now, I think if we take all of scripture into account,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   both the second and the third of these solutions,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.520]   these resolutions of the tension are true.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.720]   Both of them are true and biblical.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.160]   We don't have to choose between them.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.040]   Indeed, I don't think we should.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   We've talked in this podcast,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.120]   I went back and checked, Tony.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.360]   We've talked in this podcast at least four times
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   in the past about how there will be different rewards
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.520]   in heaven among God's children,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   different capacities to enjoy our eternal inheritance,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.680]   like the parable of where the one gets to rule 10 cities
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.600]   and one gets to rule five cities,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.120]   different teachings like that,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.680]   which point to varieties of rewards.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.640]   So what I would say here is this,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   let us seek to multiply those rewards
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.480]   as much as possible with lives of love and generosity
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.680]   and let that very lifestyle,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.800]   let it confirm that we are truly born again
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   with God's very generous nature within us.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.640]   And above all, let us make the certainty of our inheritance
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:03.800]   as God's children through faith,
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.280]   the foundation of both of those pursuits,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.960]   the multiplying of rewards
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.520]   and the confirming of our new birth.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   Both of those pursuits built on the by faith alone
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.640]   confidence we are the children of God
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.360]   with an eternal inheritance from our Father.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.560]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.160]   And as Pastor John mentioned earlier,
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.440]   we have talked four times
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   about the differing rewards in heaven.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.720]   Those are APJs 417, 549, 996, and 1188 in the archive.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.120]   And for that archive,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.080]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.960]   and there search for the episode numbers 417, 549, 996,
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.640]   and 1188.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.280]   Monday, we feel the question from a man, a humorous man,
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   a man wired to make others laugh.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.240]   How much of his personality is a liability
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.600]   to the earnest Christian life?
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.340]   And how does he protect sober mindedness
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.520]   with the deep things of God
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.320]   so that eternal things don't become punchlines?
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.160]   It's a great question.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.980]   And it's up next time.
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.640]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.680]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
