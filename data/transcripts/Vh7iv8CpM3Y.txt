[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - We have a full week of new episodes scheduled,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.440]   so let's dive in Pastor John.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.560]   Podcast listener Connor Hodges writes in to ask this,
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.640]   "Pastor John, it seems odd to me
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.160]   "that the command of Christ looks like this,
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160]   "pursue joy in me or face eternal punishment.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.280]   "If that was ever the case in this world,
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.140]   "it would seem outrageous.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.520]   "For example, if a husband says to his wife,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.960]   "you better love me above all else or I will cast you out,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.460]   "then it wouldn't really be true love from the wife
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.320]   "if she knew her only other option is to be cast out.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.880]   "I know this is wrong thinking,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.400]   "but I'm having a hard time wrestling
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.280]   "with this type of analogy."
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.400]   What would you say to Connor, Pastor John?
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.080]   - I would point out that there are three different,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.180]   though not separated, issues in what he just said.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.280]   Number one, does the Bible teach that the failure
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.960]   to delight in God results in eternal punishment?
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   Number two, if it does, does the analogy of a human husband
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.080]   setting up the same dynamic with his wife
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.880]   illumine or cloud that reality?
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.560]   Third, the way you express the connection
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.560]   between our failure to delight in God
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.720]   and our eternal loss makes a huge difference
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.560]   in whether the truth can sound acceptable or not.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   So those are three huge issues,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.920]   and they got all jumbled together in that question.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.280]   So I'm gonna take them one at a time,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.240]   'cause the first one is key.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.180]   Number one, does the Bible teach that the failure
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.680]   to delight in God results in eternal punishment?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.720]   So let's start with 1 Corinthians 16, 22.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.320]   Now, here's the most explicit biblical connection
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.940]   between the failure to love Christ
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.640]   and the punishment of a divine curse.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.800]   How easy it would have been for Paul to write,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   if anyone does not trust the Lord, let him be accursed.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.240]   In other words, we all know that salvation is by faith,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.960]   and so that would not have been so jarring,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   but that's not what he said.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   I'm not saying that loving Jesus
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.780]   only means delighting in him,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.920]   but I am saying delighting him, in him,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.400]   treasuring him, preferring him over others,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.500]   being glad to be with him,
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   these are essential to what it means to love him.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.040]   When Jesus said, "If you love me,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.400]   "you will keep my commandments,"
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.840]   he did not mean that keeping the commandments was the love.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.880]   He meant love empowers,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   enables the keeping of the commandments.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.200]   So love is prior to, it's an internal heart issue
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.080]   of cleaving to Jesus as your greatest treasure.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   So my conclusion from 1 Corinthians 16, 22 is yes,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.520]   the Bible does teach that failure to love God,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.480]   delight in God, treasure God,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.440]   cleave to God, enjoy God,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.080]   be satisfied in God, embrace God
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.080]   as your supreme delight results in eternal punishment.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.800]   You can add Deuteronomy 28, 47,
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.400]   where it makes the connection between joylessness
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.800]   and punishment explicit,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.820]   "Because you did not serve the Lord your God
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.840]   "with joyfulness and gladness of heart,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.120]   "therefore you will serve your enemies."
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.160]   So here's the connection between the absence of joy in God
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   as you serve him and the threat of suffering explicitly.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.920]   Here's one more text on this main question.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   2 Thessalonians 2.10, Paul describes who will perish
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.480]   in the end times when the lawless one does his false
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.360]   and lying signs and wonders.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.480]   He comes, it says, with wicked deception
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.680]   for those who are perishing
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   because they refuse to love the truth and be saved.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.860]   So Paul shows us that in his mind,
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.360]   a saving embrace of the truth includes cherishing the truth,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.160]   loving the truth, treasuring the truth,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.000]   delighting in the truth.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.680]   And when it's not there, he says, we perish.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.680]   And so, yes, the Bible teaches that the failure
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.720]   to delight in God or Christ or the truth of the gospel
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   results in eternal punishment.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.640]   That's the basic question, and I think the Bible says yes.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.880]   Second question, if that's true,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   does the analogy of a human husband
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.040]   setting up the same dynamic with his wife
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.360]   illumine or cloud that reality?
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.680]   Is it true that a human husband can set up the terms,
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.400]   if you don't delight in me, I will cast you out?
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.280]   Is that a good analogy?
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.260]   Does it shed light on the truth we just found?
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.400]   No, it doesn't.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.200]   The analogy is not helpful for two reasons.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.360]   One, because of the crucial difference
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.040]   between God and any husband.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.040]   God is the source and sum of all that is good and true
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.480]   and beautiful in the universe,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.000]   and God is infinite, infinitely beautiful,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.680]   infinitely valuable, and the measure
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.720]   of all that is desirable.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.000]   No husband can talk like that.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.200]   No husband can say that to his wife or to anybody.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.780]   It's just off the charts.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.240]   God is so superior in every way to any husband
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.200]   that it doesn't click, it doesn't work
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.440]   to make him the analogy.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.120]   And here's the second reason.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.960]   God has made other commands about marriage,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   namely that divorce is not permitted,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.720]   especially on such grounds as that.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.920]   Like, she doesn't delight in me anymore, I'm leaving.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.000]   I'm done with her.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.560]   The Bible says you can't say that, husband.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.600]   That's not an option for a wife
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.440]   who has stopped delighting in you.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.940]   Therefore, no husband can make that threat
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.120]   in a way that is analogous to God.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.600]   It doesn't help to set up a husband-wife
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.700]   as an illustration of God's demand
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.280]   that the world love him above all things
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.440]   because he is great above all things.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.360]   Husbands can't talk like that.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.300]   So here's my last question.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.760]   The way you express the connection here
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.440]   between our failure to delight in God
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.480]   and our eternal lostness makes a huge difference
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.400]   as to whether it sounds acceptable.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.320]   Words, you know this, Tony, words are wonderful things.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.100]   They are emotionally laden and express
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.040]   and create emotional realities.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.180]   They create emotional realities, not only express them.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.960]   As they are spoken, sometimes those emotions
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.840]   are all out of proportion with reality.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.880]   For example, what if we create the caricature
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.680]   of God saying with a sneer, like a pirate ship,
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.720]   Captain, okay, all you miserable sinners
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.000]   whom I loathe in my justice,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.800]   if you don't this instant feel happy about me,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.960]   then I'll stop taking any pleasure in you at all
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.800]   and throw you overboard.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.160]   Well, you can set it up like that, right?
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.800]   You can use language like that.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.860]   I mean, people do this all the time
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.880]   in theological debates and political debates.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.680]   Positions are restated almost all the time
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.640]   in ways that the person being represented
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.560]   would never accept, just never accept.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.280]   And yet they are used to then make the position
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.920]   look absolutely ludicrous.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.460]   But let's just try it turned around the other way.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.680]   Use a different set of language.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.760]   What if God said this, from a throne
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.800]   of highest brightness and beauty,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.720]   surrounded by 200 million angels
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   in a voice of deepest, serious, and manifest patience,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.560]   because we are not at this moment
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.800]   consumed by the fire of his holiness.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.520]   What if he said, you are my creature.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   I made you to share in and display my glory.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.000]   I created you so that your greatest joy
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.200]   and my greatest glory would be as one.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.520]   And you would never have to choose
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.840]   between honoring me and being eternally happy.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   I sent my only son to die in the place of sinners like you
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.880]   so that if you would turn to me
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.260]   and repent of your idolatrous love of other things,
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.080]   I will forgive you.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.120]   I command you, therefore, as your creator
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.800]   and as the redeemer over all the world,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.280]   turn and see me for who I really am
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.280]   and put me in your supreme place of affection.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.760]   Receive me in Jesus Christ as your savior and Lord
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.320]   and the supreme delight of your heart.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.680]   If you do, you will have everlasting joy.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.000]   And if you don't, you will have everlasting pain.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.360]   Now, I just submit, that's not ludicrous.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.400]   That's the gospel.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.840]   - Thank you, Pastor John, so good.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.120]   On this topic of eternal judgment,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.960]   there are many hard questions to ask
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.120]   and hard questions to answer.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.760]   And this is one episode of several on the topic
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.000]   that we have recorded.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.560]   And for more, open up the free mobile app
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.400]   and search for the others, and you'll find them.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.080]   Like episode number 450,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.320]   Does God Predestine People to Hell?
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.560]   And episode number 497,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   Is God Less Glorified in the Judgment of Sinners?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   Well, the questions are hard and they do not get any easier.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   Tomorrow, Pastor John will field a question
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.400]   from a sorrowful couple in North Carolina
