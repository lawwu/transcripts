[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   In Romans 1 verse 5, the Apostle Paul talks about
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.000]   the obedience of faith, or more clearly,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   the obedience that comes from faith, as the NIV puts it.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.880]   We obey God only by faith in God.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.000]   Faithless obedience is a fiction.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.080]   And this point in this text led to a late night
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.320]   life change moment for one of our listeners named Stephan.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.600]   Stephan writes in to say this,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.240]   I was listening to Piper's sermon on Romans 1.5
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.280]   late one night as I was battling to go to sleep.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.780]   I'm gonna assume that he was up and needed something to do,
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.800]   not that he was trying to fall asleep.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.860]   The whole week was one great struggle for me
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.120]   against my flesh.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.200]   I heard this verse taught like never before.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.300]   It completely changed the way I went about pursuing Christ.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.360]   I was going about pursuing holiness the wrong way.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.160]   The Lord spoke clearly to me that I had to stop
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.380]   making my number one goal holiness.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.000]   My life goal is to delight myself in him,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.480]   and from the joy I receive in him comes the grace
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.980]   which I received by faith to do good works.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.560]   Thank you Stephan for that testimony.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.800]   Here's the clip that Stephan shared in particular.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.800]   John Piper preaching on Romans 1.5 back in 1998.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.320]   Here he is.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.880]   In the book of Romans, obedience is very important.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.240]   Chapter six is gonna talk about obedience.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.700]   You are a slave to the one you obey,
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.400]   whether to righteousness or to sin.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.120]   Chapter nine, verse 32 says,
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.120]   by faith and not as though it were by works,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.760]   we obey the law.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.160]   Chapter 14, verse 23 says,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   whatever is not from faith is sin.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.720]   Which means any attempt at obedience or any other act
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.780]   which isn't springing from a heart of faith
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.640]   winds up in just being sin
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.520]   because it displeases the Lord.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   Without faith it is impossible to please God,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.920]   Hebrews 11.6.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.160]   Well, because of those kinds of verses
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   and because of this word obedience,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.960]   I'm inclined to go with the NIV here
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.000]   and say that the meaning is the goal
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.760]   or the effect of Paul's apostleship and grace
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.760]   is to bring about faith which yields obedience
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.160]   or to bring about the obedience which springs from faith.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.880]   Say it either way you want.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.160]   Both are true.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   Faith is his goal and the obedience which comes from it
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120]   is his goal.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.360]   So Paul puts a very great premium on the fact
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.760]   that obedience comes from faith.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.080]   All true obedience comes by faith.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.960]   Why is it that faith yields obedience?
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   Back up with me to point number one
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.560]   or the first part of the verse.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.560]   There it says, "I receive grace for apostleship."
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.760]   And that means that the ministry of apostleship
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.120]   and the obedience of apostleship is the gift of grace.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   And I argued that you don't receive this grace by works
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.320]   but you receive it by faith.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.080]   And therefore grace flows giving gifts
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.920]   and enablement for gifts and the obedience involved
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.240]   in fulfilling that gift through grace.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.440]   And how is it received?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.040]   It's received by faith.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.200]   And therefore you have the obedience of faith
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.440]   already implicit in point number one.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560]   You get that?
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.920]   If our gifts and our ministry
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.520]   and the obedience of that ministry are given by grace
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.960]   and if grace is received by faith and not by works
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.240]   then that obedience is channeled through faith
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   and is called in point number two, the obedience of faith.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.920]   Faith correlates with grace
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.960]   and therefore the obedience that comes from grace
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.360]   also is the obedience that comes from faith.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.600]   So if you want to be an obedient person
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.200]   and live the Christian life the way Paul conceives it
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   then work on your faith.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.080]   Don't try to work on your works
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.120]   because you'll wind up being a legalist.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   Work on your faith.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.760]   Focus on the Lord.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.400]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.160]   And so focus on Christ, know Christ, delight in Christ,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.640]   meditate on Christ, get the whole Christ before you.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.440]   Faith will rise because grace will be coming through it
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   and then obedience flows out from it.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.960]   Why does God set it up this way?
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.280]   Why does God have such a passion
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.840]   to be the giver here, the gracer?
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.480]   And why does he establish it so that works,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.120]   our works do not get it,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.200]   faith, like a little child receiving it, gets it.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.280]   Why did he set up a salvation
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.360]   and why did he set up an apostleship,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.840]   a motherhood, a singleness, a pastorate,
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.000]   a studentship, a nursery worker?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.040]   Why did he set up the Christian life
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   so that all of life is a believing reception of grace
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.760]   which then empowers obedience?
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.360]   Why did he make himself the origin of it all
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.440]   and the enabler of it all?
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   And the answer to that is given at the end of verse five.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.800]   Through Christ, we have received grace and apostleship
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.880]   to bring about the obedience of faith
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.240]   among all the Gentiles or nations or peoples.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.400]   Why, what's the ultimate goal?
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.320]   For his name's sake.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   The ultimate goal of all God's dealings with you
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.600]   is that the name of Christ would be exalted in your life
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.080]   and in your job and in your family
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.160]   and among your friendships
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.480]   and everywhere you go this afternoon and tomorrow.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.440]   Will Christ be exalted?
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Will people read the banner of Christ off your life?
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.720]   That's why you exist.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.840]   If you wonder, why do I exist?
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   State it in your mind right now.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   I exist ultimately because,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.240]   now fill in the blank,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   and I pray that God would enable you,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.480]   give you the humility and grace to fill it in
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   that the name of Christ be exalted in my life.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.600]   If you write that as the reason you exist,
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.560]   everything will be different.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.160]   Now this is why God makes our salvation and our ministry
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.480]   and all our obedience dependent upon grace
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.640]   through faith.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   If our obedience, if our ministry were to come by works,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   we would get the glory.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.840]   If I accomplish the pastorate
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.400]   in the strength that John Piper supplies,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   John Piper will get the glory and perish with it.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.000]   If I accomplish the pastorate
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.280]   in the strength that God supplies,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.800]   God will get the glory and I will get the help.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.880]   That's why he says it's all by grace through faith.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.560]   Let me read you, I'm gonna go outside Romans here.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.840]   Only time I'm going outside Romans this morning,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.760]   but it is so good.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.200]   The way Peter says it just can't be improved upon.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.800]   1 Peter 4, 11 puts it like this.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.720]   "Whoever serves,"
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.280]   now let's just make sure we all put ourselves in there.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.760]   I say pastor, father, husband,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.320]   you fill in the blank, okay?
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.560]   Grandmother, aunt, uncle, Sunday school teacher,
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   computer specialist, policeman, bricklayer.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.880]   You got your two or three things
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.040]   that you occupy your life with now?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.240]   "Whoever serves is to do so
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.960]   "in the strength which God supplies
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.600]   "so that in all things God may be glorified
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.560]   "through Jesus Christ to whom belong
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   "the glory and the dominion forever and ever, amen."
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.520]   Everywhere I go to speak,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   I was in Orlando on Thursday night,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.720]   I spoke in video conferencing with Perth, Australia
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.680]   seven o'clock Thursday morning,
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.320]   I went up to Winnipeg a week ago.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.920]   Everywhere I go, almost, I quote this verse.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.720]   And I say something like,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.840]   at Bethlehem, the closest thing I have to a verse
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.880]   that sums up a ministry philosophy is 1 Peter 4, 11.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.840]   Let him who serves serve in the strength that God supplies
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.440]   in order that God would get the glory.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.040]   And I always use those gestures.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   Like that.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.240]   And that's my theology.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.800]   Just like that.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.280]   And if you get that, if you are deaf here this morning
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.320]   and can read my lips, perhaps,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.640]   and you see, God, I need you.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.560]   I need you for this ministry, I need you for this sermon,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.400]   I need you for the baby dedication,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.000]   I need you to make it good for Noel today.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.520]   Give it to me by grace, I trust you, I don't deserve this.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.640]   I'll give you the glory, you get the glory,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.160]   people will see the glory.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.440]   You get the glory, I get the help, good deal.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.120]   This is my theology.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.280]   And I believe it's Romans 1, 5.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.120]   If it's not Romans 1, 5, you need to write me a letter.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.160]   - Wonderful clip, wonderful clip at 2 a.m. in the morning
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.320]   when you can't sleep.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.520]   Yeah, it's from John Piper's May 10th, 1998 sermon
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.400]   on Romans 1, 5, titled, "By His Grace, For His Name,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.280]   "Through the Obedience of Faith."
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.920]   And if you're not able to get to sleep,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.520]   you can find that whole message at desiringgod.org, 24/7,
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.240]   even at night, even at 2 a.m., you can find it there.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.120]   And if you've had an aha moment listening
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.080]   to a Piper sermon, send me the clip,

[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.040]   late at night.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.760]   Well, how do I know if I'm completely surrendered to Christ?
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.720]   How do I know if I'm completely surrendered to Christ?
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.300]   It's a great question, and it's coming up next
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.600]   from a listener named Maria in the Netherlands,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.960]   or Pastor John when he rejoins us on Friday.
