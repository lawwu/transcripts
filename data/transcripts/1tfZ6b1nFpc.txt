[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980]   This is my Legacy Standard Bible, handy size, I have a few
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.680]   copies of this specific Bible here but this is the one that I
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.220]   use in the pulpit most regularly.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.980]   It's goat skin so it's very supple, it moves when I want it
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.140]   to move, it flops straight open to where I need it to be.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.580]   I take my notes in it, there's plenty of space in the margins,
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.500]   it's irreplaceable to my preaching ministry.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.840]   It's also indexed so if I'm needing to flip between pages
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.740]   that makes it very easy, I don't know what I would do without it.
