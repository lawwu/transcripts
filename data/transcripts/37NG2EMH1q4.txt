[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   I wish that I could tell my 27-year-old self just to chill out, enjoy the journey. You're still
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.000]   going to get there. It might take you twice the amount of time. The things that I said no to in
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.160]   my life, I'm not going to say I have regrets, but I wish I would have gone to the music festivals
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.560]   with my friends. I wish I would have gone out to drinks with them instead of just building
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.040]   my businesses and websites. I wish I would have spent more time nurturing some friendships and
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.880]   relationships that I lost. I think you're right that there's times to grind and times to rest.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.440]   Naturally, if you're younger, you have more time, you have more energy. Right now,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.920]   I can't do nearly as much at the age of 40 that I could at 25 when I was invincible.
