[00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.520]   Okay, so interesting.
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.800]   Somebody said, what are some of the myths about the NBA?
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:13.120]   Man, I think this was a myth for me coming in something I believe.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.280]   But I think it's also a misconception that a lot of people believe.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.960]   And it's that everybody like works really, really hard.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.560]   I think like you have to be talented and you have to be gifted and
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.400]   you have to work hard to get here.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.640]   But a lot of people don't work on their game, don't work on their bodies,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.880]   don't work on staying healthy, don't put the time in recovery as much as you would think.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.760]   Like I have always been, as you know, super, super like dedicated.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.240]   And I love to work hard, but I feel like that's not the case for every NBA player.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.380]   I think I also was forced into it with my injury situation.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.540]   I had to take care of my body.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.720]   I had to get my recovery in and all that.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.960]   But yeah, I think that's the misconception.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.200]   Because even people that I worked with in Denver, they would see me in the gym every night.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.540]   And they would say like, man, before I got to the NBA and before I was working with NBA players,
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.960]   I thought everybody worked hard like you do.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960]   And I was like, me too.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.960]   I thought the same thing.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.700]   But, you know, there's a lot of talented players, a lot of gifted players.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.440]   But I think that would be the misconception that is not always true.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.360]   Now, you got the dudes that are super dedicated.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.320]   Bron has been in the league 20 years, I've heard, 20 some years.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.960]   His body, like, you have the dudes that are tremendous workers.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.640]   But you also have the dudes that are chilling for real, you know?
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.640]   And especially, sometimes once you get paid, you know, you see guys kind of chill out a little bit.
