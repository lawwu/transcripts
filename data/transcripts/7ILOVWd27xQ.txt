[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Five years ago, we said within five years, we wanted a house in Hawaii.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.180]   We wanted a house where we could have people come and visit, family and
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.520]   friends who'd come and stay with us.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.140]   I said, I wanted to surf more.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.620]   I had all this stuff we wanted to do as a couple and it wasn't five years later.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.980]   We did it like nine months later.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.900]   Cause as soon as we defined what was possible and we had a goal, all of a
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.100]   sudden I was like, well, hey, you want to go to Hawaii for a couple of months
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.760]   this winter while it's miserable and rainy in the Pacific Northwest?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.160]   Sure.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.200]   So we went there and because we knew we wanted to end up there someday, we
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.660]   started looking at real estate and all of a sudden we found a house, right?
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.640]   Is that law of attraction?
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.600]   I mean, is that wooboo stuff or is that we had a vision for where we
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.900]   wanted to go and we worked towards it.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.900]   So we do that in our marriage.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.560]   We set goals together every year.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.680]   We visit them every quarter.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600]   I have a sheet hung up on my bathroom mirror that has our goals for the year,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.400]   as well as spots for checking off, just being intentional, doing the things
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.140]   that we do in business and applying them to our personal life that has made such
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.620]   a difference on the relationship side.
