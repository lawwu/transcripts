[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   We apologise for the slight speed variation during the early part of this recording.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.480]   This was due to the stretching of the original master tape.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.760]   Here's Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.880]   are to be found in Paul's second epistle to the Thessalonians
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.120]   in the third chapter and the sixteenth verse.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.080]   The sixteenth verse of the third chapter
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.080]   of Paul's second epistle to the Thessalonians.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.480]   Now the Lord of Peace himself give you peace always, by all means.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.080]   The Lord be with you all.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.680]   Or a better translation would be this.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.680]   The Lord of Peace, now the Lord of Peace himself give you his peace, his peace.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.880]   Always, by all means.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.480]   At all times and in all ways.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.880]   The Lord be with you all.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.080]   Now that I think we are entitled to say
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   is the typical and characteristic Christmas greeting
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.480]   which is offered and sent by the Christian Church.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.080]   This is a season of greetings.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.480]   When men and women wish one another well.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   And this here at the end of one of the epistles
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480]   is what he wishes.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.280]   And it's the greatest and the best and the highest thing that he can wish
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.880]   for these Thessalonians or for anybody else.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.680]   There is nothing indeed beyond this.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.280]   That the Lord of Peace himself should give us his peace.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.680]   Always and in all ways.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.880]   Now we meet together on Christmas Eve.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.680]   And that is why I call your attention to a word of greeting.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   Such as this.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   A kind of benediction that the apostle wished for these friends
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   to whom he was writing this letter.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.280]   And of course the connection between this wish
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.680]   and what we are celebrating tonight and will do so tomorrow
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.880]   is quite clear.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.080]   The Son of God came down from heaven to earth
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.880]   entirely and solely in order that this kind of wish
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.480]   might be made possible.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.280]   And that it might become effective in our lives.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.080]   That is the whole meaning, the whole purpose of Christmas.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.480]   It's the whole explanation of the incarnation.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.280]   The coming of the Son of God out of the glory
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.080]   into this world of time and of sin and of shame.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.480]   And therefore it seemed to me that we could do nothing better
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.280]   on this occasion as we prepare our minds for tomorrow
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.480]   than that we should consider what this statement really
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   has got to say to us.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.280]   Now no word is more frequently and more regularly associated
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.880]   with the coming of the Son of God into this world
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.080]   than this word "peace".
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.880]   You noticed it in the reading at the beginning.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.280]   The angelic host, what did they sing?
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace."
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.480]   "Goodwill toward men."
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.280]   There it is you see at the very beginning.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.680]   The heavenly host is explaining to these ignorant shepherds
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   what all this is about and that's how they do it.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   "Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.080]   who is Christ the Lord."
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   Well why has he come?
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   Well that's the answer.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.480]   Peace on earth.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.080]   Goodwill toward men.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   The gospel is in many places referred to as the gospel of peace.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.480]   God himself is called the God of peace.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.080]   There is no term I say that is so constantly and characteristically
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.880]   associated with the whole movement of salvation
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.480]   and without Lord himself.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.080]   As just this particular word.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.480]   The gospel of Jesus Christ in other words
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.080]   is concerned about this whole matter of peace.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.880]   Very well.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.080]   The test therefore of our understanding of this gospel.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.880]   The test of our experience of this gospel
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.480]   can be put quite simply in this way.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.080]   Do we know this peace?
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.880]   The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.480]   Are we enjoying it?
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.080]   This is a time not only for rejoicing but for self-examination.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.680]   The thing surely that should be of greatest concern to all of us is this.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.880]   Have we derived the benefits that we were intended to derive
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   from the coming of the Son of God out of the glory into this world of time?
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.280]   Are we the inheritors, the beneficiaries of all that he came to do
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   in the wonderful way that is described in the pages of these gospels
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   and expanded in these New Testament epistles and writings?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.680]   Now my friends here is the question we must therefore all ask one another at this moment.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.880]   Do we know this peace?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.080]   Are we enjoying it?
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.080]   Surely this of all questions should be the one that is uppermost in our minds
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   especially at a time such as this in the history of the world.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.680]   In spite of the state of the world in which we find ourselves
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.880]   are we knowing this peace always and by all means?
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.280]   He came into the world to give us that.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.080]   And that is why it follows of necessity
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.480]   that a man who is a Christian and who believes these things
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.080]   should be entirely different from those who are not Christians.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.880]   Now this is not a question of bursting
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.680]   because it isn't anything that a Christian has done himself or herself.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   We can't produce peace, any of us.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.880]   We've all tried to do it but we can't do it.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.680]   It's one thing men cannot do at all.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.880]   He can do many things but he can never find rest.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.480]   He can't find peace for himself.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.080]   But here is a gospel that offers it.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.280]   He's come in order that there may be peace on earth
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.480]   and that we may enjoy this peace always and by all means.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.680]   And I say therefore that this is the differentiating mark
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.480]   between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   The Christian is a man who having believed on this person
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.880]   has received this peace and nobody else has it.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.280]   But you see it becomes a test therefore of our profession.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.680]   God knows we can be church members without having this peace.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.880]   But this is the test.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.080]   We may say we are Christians.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.280]   Well if we are Christians we know something about this peace.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.880]   It means being in this relationship to him
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   which leads us to experience the benefits of all this.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   So I ask this evening, do we know this peace?
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.680]   Are we enjoying it?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.480]   The business of the Christian church is to proclaim it, to announce it.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.280]   And surely never was the world in greater need of this particular message
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   than it is at this terrible hour in our history as a human race.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   Now let's look at it together.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.480]   Let's take therefore first of all this question.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   Why is this greeting necessary?
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.880]   Why is this the highest thing that we could ever wish to anybody?
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.080]   That the Lord of Peace himself should give us his peace always
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.280]   and by all means.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.680]   Why is this the greatest need of men, the greatest need of the whole world?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.080]   Now we've got to start with this.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.480]   Because we can't understand this kind of text.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.880]   We can't understand what happened when the Son of God came into this world
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.480]   unless we have some understanding of the need.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.680]   You see that's the question that should always be asked first.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   Why did the Son of God come into the world?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.280]   Why was it necessary for him to come?
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.080]   It's the most stupendous thing that's ever happened.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   There's nothing that in any way compares to this.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.880]   When God created at the beginning, he didn't come into the world.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.480]   He just said let there be light and there was light.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.880]   A word was sufficient.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.280]   But here he comes himself in the person of the Son.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.680]   There's nothing I say that in any way can compare with this.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.280]   It is the most staggering event that the world has ever known.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.480]   Stupendous.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.280]   The Apostle Paul, you remember looking at it, stands back in amazement and says
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.080]   great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.880]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.680]   It is, I say, the unique event of all history.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.880]   But here's the question.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   Why did it happen?
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.280]   Why did it ever take place?
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   Well, then, the answer to that is to realize something of the need, the state of the world.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.680]   And surely this ought to be clearer to us at a time like this present time
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.880]   than it has perhaps ever been in the history of the world.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   You call the world is characterized by what?
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:54.680]   Well, by above everything else, by restlessness, trouble, insecurity, fear.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.280]   And these are all the opposite of peace.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.480]   The Apostle John in his first epistle says fear hath torment.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.080]   And it has.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.680]   Fear is a torment.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.880]   And that is the whole state of the world this evening.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.480]   Surely nobody will query or question that.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.080]   If there is one thing that is more characteristic, I say, than anything else about the world as it is tonight,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.680]   it is just this restlessness, insecurity, fear, terror, alarm.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.280]   What's going to happen?
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.880]   What is this next year that's coming hold for us?
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   These are the questions.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:38.480]   The world, I say, has never been in such need of peace as it is just now.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:45.680]   It's torn and divided asunder, iron curtains, two great divisions of the whole world.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:52.280]   And even within these two sections, divisions, rivalries, tensions, unhappiness and misery,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.880]   our papers are full of it, we are constantly hearing about it.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.280]   All this is nothing but the absence of peace.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:08.080]   The world is unhappy, torn, divided, at enmity within itself.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:17.280]   And the whole situation, I say, one which leads to this kind of perpetual restlessness and fear and foreboding.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.880]   Well now, then, here is our question.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   Why is that?
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.080]   What's the cause of this?
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.880]   You see, my dear friends, there's no point or purpose whatsoever in just sentimentalizing at a time like this.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.480]   The world does it every year, but nothing comes of it.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.880]   But still it goes on doing it, and that's the measure of its desperation.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   It's so desperate it'll clutch at anything.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   But the question is, what's the cause of this?
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   And that's the thing that the world doesn't seem to be ready to face.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.080]   But there's no hope until we face the problem.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.880]   There's no hope in any realm or department unless you face the facts.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.280]   If it's your health that's going wrong, well, find out what's the matter.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.480]   Make a diagnosis.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   If your business is slipping, investigate.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.280]   Don't just go on hoping that it'll soon be right.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   Find out the cause of the trouble.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.680]   If there's something going wrong in your married life, your personal life, whatever it is, stop and face it.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.080]   There's never any hope unless you face the facts.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.880]   It's exactly the same with regard to this whole problem of life and living,
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   and as to whether we enjoy this peace, or whether we are in this state of restlessness and fear, and filled with foreboding.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.880]   Well, now, there's a great answer to this question in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.480]   What's the cause of the restlessness, the absence of peace?
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   The Bible puts it in one word. It's a word called sin.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.280]   Sin. Nothing else. There's only one explanation.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.480]   That's why the world is as it is at this moment.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.680]   That's why we are individually as we are.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.280]   It's all due to this thing which is called sin.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   That's why it's so important to read the whole of your Bible.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   There are many people who want to start with the New Testament.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.880]   Indeed, they'd shed the Old Testament altogether if they had their way.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.280]   Oh, what a foolish thing it is.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:17.880]   The Old Testament sets the stage, as it were, for this unique event which happened.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   The Old Testament is the preparation for what happened when the Son of God was born as a babe in Bethlehem.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   Here's the background. Here's the setting. Here's the explanation.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.880]   Here's the thing that shows the need, the reason why he ever came.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   And it's this. It's this thing called sin.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   Here, you see, is a unique explanation.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   The world was never meant to be like this.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   My dear friends, God never created a world like this.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   It's inconceivable.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   The almighty everlasting God, who is absolute perfection and who does everything perfectly,
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   he never made a world like this.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   No, no. He made a perfect world.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Well, why is it as it is? Well, here's the answer.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.880]   Man, in his folly, listened to the tempter and he rebelled against God.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   He lifted himself up in pride and he fell.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   And he brought all this trouble upon himself.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   This is the position.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   Man was in a state of paradise, innocence, perfection.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.880]   And there was no trouble.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   There was no dis-ease.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   There was no restlessness in the Garden of Eden.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   But suddenly, as I say, man listened and he fell in his rebellion.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.880]   And what happened? Well, the account tells us all about it.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   New things came into life immediately.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   The first effect of the sin of man was that man became filled with fear.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.880]   Before that, nothing had given him greater delight than to hear the sound of the voice of God.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   He'd been living in communion with God, enjoying life with God.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   And it was perfect.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   A life of peace, happiness, joy, tranquility, everything that can be desired.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.880]   But he fell into sin. And do you remember what happened?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   We are told that they heard the voice of God in the garden in the cool of the evening.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.880]   And immediately they ran to hide behind some trees.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   Fear has already possessed them.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   God hasn't said a word to them.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   He's just come down to visit them as he had done before.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   But now they hear the sound of his voice and they run in terror.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   They're afraid of him.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   You see, they've already lost their peace, haven't they?
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.880]   That's how it all began.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   It didn't stop at that.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.880]   They were both frightened of God, their benefactor, their friend, their creator, their sustainer, their everything.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.880]   Now his presence becomes a cause of terror.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   But then, you see, they began even to quarrel with one another.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   Adam says, "The woman thou gavest me, she did this."
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   They're quarreling with one another. That's it.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   Here's an epitome of the whole of life.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   The moment they sinned, you see, it's quarreling everywhere, restlessness against each other.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   Not only that, they even had to begin fighting creation, nature.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Prior to their sin, they just took the fruit and ate it.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.880]   But the moment they sinned, a curse came upon the earth.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.880]   "By the sweat of thy brow thou shalt eat thy bread."
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   From now on, man's got a perpetual fight.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   Nature's against him. Thorns and broilers.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   If you do nothing to your ground, it'll be overridden very soon by thorns and broilers.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   It's a fight, a constant fight, and you can't relax.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   There's no peace even between man and creation.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   Fighting the animals, fighting these weeds and thorns and broilers, pestilences, diseases come in.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   There's a warfare between man and the whole of creation.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   And it all was the result of man's original sin and disobedience, his rebellion, and his falling away from God.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   Now then, there, according to this book and its teaching, is the thing that produces the need of peace.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   You see, the world is as it is tonight in its restlessness and in its agony and its striving,
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   not as a part of this upward reach and progress of men and his attempt to develop and to reach perfection.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   It isn't growing pains that men are suffering from.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   No, no, the explanation is the fall.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   The whole trouble is due to the fact that men have become estranged from God.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.880]   That's the cause.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   The first thing was to become enmity against God, to feel that God was against them, so they run to hide.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   But God who'd made them and blessed them, put them into paradise, showered his gifts upon them,
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   now becomes an enemy, estranged from God, afraid of God, that he's going to strike us.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   Now this is the human race tonight, isn't it? It hates God.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   It really does hate him. It pretends it doesn't very often.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   But men, in his heart of hearts, he hates God. He feels God is against him.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.880]   That's why he's always ready to listen to anybody who speaks a word against God,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   or any scientist who prefers to do away with God. It's always popular.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   That's the hatred of the natural heart against God.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   But you see, he's not only at enmity against God, he's at enmity within.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   And this is what men, of course, so hates, but he can do nothing about it.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   You can decide not to believe in God, but that won't give you peace.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   You won't have peace within.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   You'll be fighting with yourself.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   Your conscience will be upbraiding you. You may not call it conscience,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.880]   but there's something in you that upbraids you and condemns you.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.880]   And of course, if only a man could get rid of this conscience and throttle it or drown it somehow,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   how happy you'd be, but he can't do it.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   You can escape to the other ends of the earth from people, but you can never escape from yourself.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   And wherever you go, you'll have this conscience within you, and it'll remind you of things.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   And it'll bring up the past against you, and you'll be unhappy, you'll be miserable,
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   you'll have remorse, you'll kick yourself, you'll hate yourself for certain things you do.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.880]   Men not only lost his peace with God, he lost his peace with himself.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   There's a civil war going on within every one of us by nature, and how well we know it.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.880]   And therefore, the result of this is that we're at enmity against other people.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   You see, in an attempt to defend ourselves, we blame it on others.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   It's always somebody else.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.880]   I'm all right if I were only given a chance, but this other person.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   And then the nations do the same. It's always another nation.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   We are always perfect, it's always somebody else.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   Even though they do what we've done. We said we were right, but they're wrong.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   Isn't that it? That's why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   Now, it's all due to this thing called sin.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   It is the most divisive farce that has ever entered into the universe.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   It's always disruptive.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   It always leads to a lack of ease, a lack of peace, a lack of security, a lack of tranquility.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Now then, the world is like that.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   And it's been like that throughout the running centuries.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   From the dawn of history, it's been like that.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   Secular history teaches this quite as plainly as the biblical history, but it never gives the explanation.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   That's the one big difference. The facts are acknowledged.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   But it's vital that we should understand the reason and the cause.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   Now then, it was into a world like that that he came.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   It was because the world was like that that he came.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   That's the whole meaning and explanation.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   And so we are told here that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord of Peace.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.880]   What's it mean?
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   "Well," says the apostle, "the Lord of Peace himself give you his peace always and by all means."
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.880]   Why do you think he calls him the Lord of Peace?
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   What a term! There are many designations applied to our blessed Lord.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   But this in many ways is the most wonderful of them all, the Lord of Peace.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.880]   Or if you prefer it, the Prince of Peace.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:33.880]   The prophets, given by divine inspiration, a foreview of his coming, they like to call him the Prince of Peace.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   This is the great name.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.880]   This is the supreme designation, the Lord of Peace.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   Why is he called this?
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   Well, there are many explanations of that. I'm only going to hint at two or three of them in passing this evening.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   One, and quite sufficient in and of itself, of course, is this.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   He's like that in his own nature.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   He knew what it was to have perfect peace.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.880]   Haven't you often been struck as you read the accounts, the stories, in the pages of the four Gospels,
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.880]   at that curious tranquility that ever characterized him?
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   When people were fussing and busy and excited and rushing here and there, the calmness and the peace.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   His own disciples were getting anxious about him.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   You remember the incident at the death of Lazarus?
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   He said, "Let's go and see him." And Thomas tries to dissuade him.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   He said, "You're walking into the very jaws of death."
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   And our Lord turns quietly to him and to the others and says, "Oh, they're not twelve hours in the day."
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   Another time they warned him and said, "That fox Herod has decided to kill you."
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   "It's all right," he says, "today and tomorrow."
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.880]   "And the third day I must do miracles."
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   Oh, the calmness and the peace and the tranquility that ever characterized him.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   He walks majestically and calmly through this world of sin and shame and rebellion and contradiction.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   And there's a tranquility and a quietness and a peace and a calmness about him,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   which is quite inexplicable except in terms that this is indeed and truth the only begotten Son of God.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   He's the Lord of peace. He's full of it.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   He is in and of himself the perfect demonstration of what peace really means.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   But not only that, his whole purpose and object in coming into the world, I say,
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   was to bring this peace which has been lost as the result of sin.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   These are the terms that are used. He's called, isn't he, the mediator.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   What's a mediator? Well, a mediator is one who comes between two disputants.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   They're separated by the dispute. And a mediator comes, and what does he do?
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   Well, the word itself in its original meaning tells us exactly what he does.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   He takes hold of the one with the one hand and he takes hold of the other with the other,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.880]   and he brings them together. The mediator. He makes peace.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   And this is the glory of this Christmas message, that he came into the world to be a mediator.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   You remember this apostle Paul puts it in writing his first epistle to Timothy in the second chapter there.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   There is one God and one and only one mediator between God and men, the man, Christ Jesus.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   You know, this is his function. This is his business. He came. Why did he come?
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   Well, here's another great New Testament word, to reconcile.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. That's to say, making peace again.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   There's a quarrel, dispute, an estrangement.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   And the business of a peacemaker, the business of a mediator, a reconciler, is to bring the parties together.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   There it is. Well, I mustn't worry with these terms, and yet they're very glorious terms. Let's thank God for them.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   This is his business. That's why he's come.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   Oh, the Son of God, my dear friends, didn't leave the courts of heaven and come into this sinful world,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   merely to give a kind of display, some tabloid. No, no. He came to make peace.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   He came to reconcile. He came to give us peace.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.880]   So he's called the Prince of Peace, the Lord of Peace.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   But I think it has another meaning. And this is the one I want to develop with you.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.880]   It means that he controls it. He is the Lord of it.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   Now, this means this, of course, that it's in his possession, and in his possession alone.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   The Lord is the one who controls, he owns, and he governs the domain.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   He is the Master, the Supreme Master. He is the Lord of it all.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   And the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Lord of Peace.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   Here's our message, that he and he alone is able to give us peace.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   Now, there's a challenge about this Christmas message.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   It's the challenge of the Christian Church to the whole world tonight.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   It is just this, that there is no such thing as true peace apart from him.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   The world can't find it. He and he alone can give it.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   He is the Lord of Peace.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.880]   Very well, let's work it out. Look at it like this.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   The Apostle says, "The Lord of Peace himself gives you his peace."
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   He's got it, he possesses it, but thank God he's able to give it.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   And if he were not able to give it, I'd have no message to preach to you tonight.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   If he had just come into this world and had walked through it in the way I've been trying to describe,
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.880]   in all the majesty of his divine perfection and his perfect humanity,
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   walking peacefully and quietly with his peace through this evil sinful world,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   well, far from helping us in a way, it would be nothing but a sheer condemnation of us.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   It would be the most discouraging thing of all.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   We'd look at him and we'd say, "Well, yes, that's marvelous, but I'm not like that.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   How can I be like that?"
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.880]   Well, but you see, this is the message.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   He came into the world not only to demonstrate it, he came to give it.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.880]   He can't just be an example to us because we are utterly hopeless.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.880]   We are so inferior that we are condemned by it, we are dazzled into nothing by it.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   But no, thank God he came to give it.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   And the essence of this Christian gospel is the grace of God, a giving, a giving.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   The Lord of Peace himself gives you his peace, and he can give it, my friend.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   That's what makes it such a privilege to preach this gospel this evening on this Christmas Eve,
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   that I can offer you in his blessed name, whatever you are and whatever your circumstances, his peace.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   Now then, but how can he do this?
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   What enables him to do this? That's the question.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   What puts him into this position that he can give us this greatest boon and blessing?
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   And here, of course, is the whole statement of the Christian gospel.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   Let me summarize it in a few words this evening.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   How can he give us this peace?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   What makes him the Lord of Peace, the absolute controller of it, and the sole controller of peace?
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   What puts him into this position?
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   Well, that's the whole story that is unfolded in the history given in the four gospels.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   He does it like this.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   Something is necessary before he can be the Lord and the controller of peace.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   What is it?
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   Well, he has somehow or another got to get us this peace from God.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   God is the author of all peace. God, the God of peace.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.880]   So the Son came into the world in order to purchase this peace for us, to reconcile us to God.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   How did he do it? Well, he did it like this.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   I assure you that the cause of the loss of peace is rebellion, disobedience against God.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   For when man disobeys God, he is punished. God punished the originals, sent them out of the garden,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   drove them out, and put the flaming sword and the cherubim to stop their way back into paradise.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   That's the wrath of God upon sin.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   And there's no hope of peace until man is again reconciled to God, and God begins to bless him once more.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   How can that be done? Well, there's only one way. It's the way that our Lord took.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   He first of all let her come into this world from the glory, the tranquility, the peace,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   the perfect joy of heaven, who came into this world.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   Can you imagine what it meant?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   What amazes me is how as Christian people we can be so cold, so quiet, so still.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   Think of it, my friend. In order that you and I might enjoy a measure of peace,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   the Son of God left the place of peace and came into this war-torn, this war-stricken,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   this thriving malignant world of ours.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   He came right into the midst of it, in the contradiction of sinners,
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   and all that we know to be so true of life.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   He came into it, and he came in and took human nature.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   He became truly man. Why?
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.880]   Well, in order that he might fight for us, that he might be our representative.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   In order that he might deal on our behalf with God,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   and in order that he might reconcile us to God.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   So he came and he took on human nature.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   That's why he was born as a baby in Bethlehem.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   He couldn't have sympathized with us if he had not been made human.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   He wouldn't understand it. How could he?
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   It's inconceivable. God is everlastingly different from sin.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   So he had to become man, and he lived life like an ordinary human being in this world of time.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   That's the whole meaning of the incarnation.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   Then watch him as he goes along.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   He renders a perfect obedience to God's law.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.880]   He never disobeyed. He never broke a law. He never sinned.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.880]   He was able to stand up and face his accusers at the end,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   and suggest that no man could accuse him of any sin, and nobody could.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   He said that the devil even would come, but he'd find nothing in him.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   It's at the end of that 14th chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   He's entirely sinless.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   He has given perfect obedience to God's holy law.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   He didn't do it for himself. He did it for us.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   He had to do it if we are ever to enjoy peace.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   But oh, even that wasn't enough, because the wages of sin is death.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   And God has announced from the very beginning that the soul that sinneth it shall die,
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   and death is the punishment of sin.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   Oh, therefore can we have peace with God?
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   Oh, here's the answer.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   You know the Son of God came into this world to die.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   He had to.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   That's why he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   He could have evaded it. He could have avoided it.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   He told them just before the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.880]   He said, "Know you not that I could commend 12 legions of angels to deliver me?"
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   He could have been wafted to heaven without dying at all.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   But if he'd done that, he would never have saved us.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   He would never have fulfilled all righteousness as he said.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   He'd never have given us peace. No, no.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   Before we can know this peace, he's got to bear the punishment of our sin.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   He's got to bear our guilt and its punishment, and he did so.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   So the Apostle Paul, you see, in writing to the Colossians,
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   in Colossians 1.20, puts it in these striking and remarkable words,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   "And having made peace through the blood of his cross,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   by him to reconcile all things unto himself,
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   by him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven."
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   He makes peace by the blood of his cross.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.880]   What makes him the Lord of Peace is that he's died for our sins,
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   was wounded for our transgressions.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.880]   The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.880]   By his stripes we are healed.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   And so by dying for us and our sins, he becomes the Lord of Peace.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   He has satisfied the law of God.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   The wrath of God has meted out its punishment upon him.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   God is fully satisfied.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   His honor, his name, his righteousness are everlastingly vindicated.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   So now he gives this gift of peace to his son.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   Here is the reconciler.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.880]   He has purchased the Lordship of Peace
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   by his spotless, perfect life of obedience,
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   by his sacrificial atoning death, by the blood of his cross.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   He has purchased the right to become the Lord of Peace.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   Very well, that is why he is now in a position to give it to us.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   And so the apostle is able to say, "Now the Lord of Peace himself
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   gives you his peace."
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.880]   He's got the gift.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   He possesses it absolutely.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   He's got this peace of God and he can give it to men and women.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   He has earned the right to do so.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   Very well.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   Let us notice then the peace he gives us.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.880]   And here is the way the apostle puts it.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   "Now the Lord of Peace," he says, "himself gives you his peace."
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   Why does he put it like that, you think?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.880]   Well, there's no difficulty about that.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.880]   He wants you to contrast it with another peace.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   You must be quite clear, my friends, about the peace that is offered you tonight
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   by the Son of God, if you haven't got it.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   Did you come in here unhappy, troubled, miserable, ill at ease,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.880]   restless, dissatisfied, and do you say,
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   "What I want above everything else in this world is peace."
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   Very well, I say, he's got it to give you.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.880]   You must be quite clear as to the kind of peace it is.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.880]   It is his peace and it's unlike any other peace.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.880]   Of course, he said that himself.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   If you went on reading that 14th chapter of John,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.880]   a portion of which I read at the beginning,
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   you'd find that our Lord said this in verse 27,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   "Peace I leave with you.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   My peace I give unto you,
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   Let not your heart be troubled,
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.880]   neither let it be afraid."
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.880]   Here he is, you see, at the end of his life,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   and he's just made an announcement to these disciples
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   that he's going to leave them, that he's going to be put to death.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   And they were all immediately troubled.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   They looked at one another and said,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   "If he is going, what can we do?"
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   Because while he was there,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.880]   somehow or another things seemed to be different.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   These were just typical men,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   and like ourselves, these disciples,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.880]   and while he was there, everything seemed all right.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.880]   It doesn't matter whether you were in a storm at sea.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   He could just get up and say, "Peace, be still."
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   And the waves subsided and the hurricanes stopped.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   You might be in a great crowd and there was no food,
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   and the people were hungry and tired.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   It was all right.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.880]   Five loaves and two fishes are enough for him,
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.880]   and he can feed the whole 5,000,
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.880]   and there's plenty to spare.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   There was never a problem, but that he could always solve it.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   And whatever the circumstances, therefore, these men felt,
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   well, as long as he is with us,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   we needn't be unhappy, all is well.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   But he announces his departure.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   He's going to die.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.880]   He's going to leave them,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   and they're all filled with consternation and alarm.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   They say, "What shall we do?"
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   And he looked at them and said,
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   "Let not your hearts be troubled.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   Don't get frightened. Don't be alarmed.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   You believe in God, believe also in me."
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   And then he goes on to say later on in that chapter,
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   "I shall not leave you comfortless.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   I shall not leave you orphans.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   I'm going," he says, "in a physical sense,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   but I'm not going to leave you.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   I'm going to send you another comfort of the Holy Ghost.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   And when the Holy Ghost has come into you, I'll be in you.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   He'll mediate me to you.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   The Father and I will take up our abode in you.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   Do go home and read the 14th chapter of John's Gospel, my dear friends.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   And there you see he sums it up at the end.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   'My peace I leave with you.'
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   Not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   Let not your hearts be troubled,
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   neither let it be afraid."
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.880]   It's his peace.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.880]   Why does he draw this distinction?
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880]   Well, isn't it obvious?
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   Isn't it obvious in this modern world tonight?
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   The world, poor old sinful world,
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.880]   is talking about its peace tonight.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.880]   People are trying to persuade themselves that they're happy
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   and that all is well.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   Season of goodwill, season of happiness,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   brotherhood, friendship, all is well.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   Peace.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   Oh, the tragedy.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   'Not as the world giveth,' he says, 'give I unto you.'
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   My peace I give unto you.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   The peace that he enjoyed himself.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   It's unlike that other peace.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   Why? Well, that other one, you see, is false.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   It's not true.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.880]   It's make-believe.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   It's superficial.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   It's not genuine.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   It'll all evaporate.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.880]   It's never really in existence at all.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   It's a kind of terminology that we use and we know it's hollow.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.880]   There's nothing in it.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   We all pretend to be friendly.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.880]   But are we?
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.880]   Do we really mean it?
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.880]   No, no, it's false, superficial.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.880]   And in any case, it's very temporary.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.880]   The poor world is so distracted, it's so unhappy,
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   it's so restless, it'll clutch at any straw.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   We believe a foolish newspaper,
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.880]   a placard.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   I remember just before the beginning of the last world war,
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   I was on holiday.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.880]   And there I saw a great crowd of people.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.880]   And they were all smiling at one another and waving their hands.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.880]   What was it?
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.880]   It was towards the end of August 1939.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   One of the popular daily newspapers had brought out a placard.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   "There is to be no war."
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   And everybody believed it.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   Thought we'd got peace.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   Poor Mr. Chamberlain came back waving his piece of paper.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   "Peace in our time!"
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   And the world became delirious in its excitement.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   But there wasn't peace.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   Ah, for the time being, you seem to forget your troubles.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.880]   And that's always the characteristic of this false piece of the world.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.880]   You have to drink or something or drug yourself,
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   and then you're wonderfully happy, you're enjoying great peace.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   But you see, it's all a sham, it's all false, it's not true.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   Or you just turn your back upon it all and you say,
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   "Oh, well, it's no use crying over spilt milk.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.880]   Let's have a good night's enjoyment at dinner,
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   and pull down the blinds, let's let ourselves go."
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.880]   And you say, "Marvellous!"
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   Then you have to go out into the street with all its coldness and darkness,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   and back to the old problems and the old difficulties.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   They're still there.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   That's how the world tries to give peace.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   It's doing it again this Christmas.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   But oh, how hollow it is.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   How empty, how vague, how transient, evanescent, passing.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   And it all depends upon circumstances always.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   If circumstances happen to be fairly favourable,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   well, we think that all is well and we're enjoying peace.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   In a moment they can change and all's gone.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   That's why so often you'll see many a happy family in this country.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.880]   They don't go to church, of course, not that they've outgrown that,
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.880]   they're too intellectual.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   They don't believe in this sort of fairy tale, this nonsense.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.880]   They're rationalists, but they're very good, decent, moral, living people.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   And all is well and they're very happy together and enjoying perfect peace.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   Suddenly, the angel of death taps at the door.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   And the father or the mother or some darling child is taken and there's no more peace.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   You see, it's a peace that is contingent upon certain peculiar, special circumstances.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.880]   And the moment that varies, it's all gone.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.880]   Thank God, I say, that isn't the peace he gives.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   It's his peace.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   My peace, he says.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880]   This is different. Why?
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   Well, it's solid, it's deep, it's based on something that's durable.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   What is it?
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   Well, I've already been explaining to you.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   It isn't a transient, false peace dependent upon not noticing circumstances.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.880]   It's a peace that starts by giving me peace with God.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   And that's the source and the fount of every blessing.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   And you can be clever and able and wealthy and anything you like.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.880]   If you're not right with God, you'll never know peace.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.880]   Never. Impossible.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   Men have tried it throughout the running centuries.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   Never has a man succeeded. It's impossible.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.880]   The first essential is to be right with God.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   So the apostle says in writing to the Romans in chapter 5, verse 1,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   "Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God."
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   We know that all is right between us and God.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.880]   Christ has died for us.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   We are forgiven in him.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   We are at peace with God.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   Now then, there is a possibility of real peace.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   And you see, out of that comes peace with myself.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   What does it mean? It means this.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   I believe this gospel. I believe I'm forgiven.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   Then the devil comes and tempts me and says, "But look here, how do you know?
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   What if you fall into sin again?" And you did fall into sin yesterday.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   What about that?
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   And he brings me back under condemnation.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   But you know, if I believe this truly, if I have Christ's peace, I can answer him.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:44.880]   "I say there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   I am dead to the law, dead to every form of condemnation.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   If I am in Christ, I am there forever and nothing can ever rob me of my peace.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   Peace with God, which is guaranteed, and therefore I have peace within.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   I know that I am forgiven and that I can never fall from this position.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   God himself has declared me to be just in Christ.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   Not only that, I know that he will always lead me and guide me.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   He has promised to do so.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   And I rest upon his promises.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   "I will not leave you orphans. I will come again. I will visit you. I will lead you."
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   These are his promises that God looks upon us as a father now
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.880]   and is going to bless us and to lead us all along the way.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   While I am remaining in this life, even in death and always, so I have peace within myself.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   There are many things I don't understand, but I say Christ does and I am in him.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.880]   And it gives me peace with others.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   Because I look at men and women now in a new way and I see that they are all like I was,
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.880]   I don't see the man so much I see sin making him what he is.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   How could God ever forgive me?
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.880]   Well, it was because he didn't look at me as such so much as upon my sin.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   And then he dealt with it in Christ.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   He loves the unlovely.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   And I look at others. Before I used to say, "This man, this or that."
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   I say, "No, I am sorry for that man. That man is a slave of sin. He can't help himself.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   He needs a new nature. He needs a new life as I needed it.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.880]   I can understand the weaknesses and the faults and the failures of sins and sins of others
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   in a way I never could before.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.880]   And so I am at peace with them. They are like I am.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   And we are all together in need of this same peace of God."
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   Well, that's just a very brief outline and summary of how he does it.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   And that's the kind of peace he gives.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   He gives you peace with God.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.880]   He gives you peace with yourself.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   He gives you peace with others.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.880]   And you notice this. This is the most wonderful thing of all.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   Now the Lord of Peace himself gives you peace always and by all means.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   Which means under all circumstances and conditions, whatsoever may come to meet you.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   At all times and in all ways.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   There is no limit to it.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   This is the most amazing thing of all.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.880]   The world's false peace is entirely dependent upon circumstances.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.880]   Here is a peace that is entirely independent of circumstances.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   Whatever your position, always, in all ways, wherever you are, whatever is happening to you.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.880]   Anything you like to imagine.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   You can still have it and you can still enjoy it.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   How does he do it?
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.880]   Well, he does it in the ways I've already been describing you.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.880]   But above all he does it like this.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.880]   By being with you himself.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   This is the mystery of the Christian life.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   That if we are truly Christian, we know he is with us.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:03.880]   All the way my Savior leads me, what have I to ask beside?
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.880]   And I can always turn to him and pray to him.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.880]   And ask him to lead me, guide me.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   Oh, thou great Jehovah, pilgrim through this world of time.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   I am weak but thou art mighty.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.880]   Hold me with this, with thy powerful hand.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   There it is, bread of heaven.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   Feed me now and evermore.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.880]   And I know that he will do it.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   He has promised to do it.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.880]   He has said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.880]   I shall be with thee always, even unto the end.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.880]   These are his promises.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   He comes, he will be with us.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   He will guide us, he will lead us.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.880]   He will never forsake us.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.880]   These are the promises.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.880]   And on the strength of these, my peace is in all circumstances.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.880]   And in all conditions, come what may.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.880]   Shall I put it then as I close, in the terms of a hymn that we often sing here.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   Question and answer.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.880]   Peace?
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.880]   Perfect peace?
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   In this dark world of sin?
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.880]   Is it possible?
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   Answer, the blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   Peace? Perfect peace by thronging duties pressed?
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   Is it possible?
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   To have peace though you are thronged by duties on all sides?
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   The answer is, to do the will of Jesus.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   This is rest.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   Didn't he say, come unto me all ye that labour under heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.880]   My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.880]   Whatever the circumstances, if you but realize his promise and his presence, it will give you rest.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   Go on, peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   And aren't they surging round us in this world?
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   The answer, on Jesus' bosom?
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.880]   Nought but calm is found.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:14.880]   Go on, peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.880]   In Jesus' keeping, we are safe, and they.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.880]   Are you thinking of some loved one far away tonight?
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   Across the oceans perhaps?
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   The other end of the world?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   In some position of hazard, or of danger, or of difficulty?
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.880]   And are you restless and unhappy? Have you lost your peace?
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   Listen, peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880]   Here's the answer.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.880]   In Jesus' keeping, we are safe, and they.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   He's everywhere. He's omnipresent.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   What of 1962? Are the bombs to be used?
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   It's all so unknown and so uncertain.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   Jesus we know, and he is on the throne.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   Whatever men may do, we are safe in him.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.880]   The world can't harm us in his hands.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.880]   It may kill us, but it doesn't harm us.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.880]   It doesn't rob us of our peace.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   He's on the throne, the ultimate throne of the universe.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:28.880]   Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   You say the Lord of peace himself give you peace always, by all means?
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   What if bereavement and sorrow visit me in the future?
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   Do you say I can still have it?
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   Here's the answer.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   Jesus has vanquished death and all its power.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.880]   He's risen triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.880]   The resurrection proclaims him to be the victor.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.880]   So even though we die, we shall live again.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.880]   There is no death to the Christian.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.880]   He just falls asleep.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   He has opened the gateway of heaven.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.880]   He has brought life and immortality to light through his gospel.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.880]   Very well, let's conclude with the writer of the hymn, "It is enough."
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   Earth's struggles soon shall cease, and Jesus calls us to heaven's perfect peace.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   So he looks down upon this evil, sinful, and happy world of ours tonight,
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.880]   and he says to all who believe in him, "Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.880]   Believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.880]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.880]   I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.880]   And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself,
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   that where I am, there he may be also.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   My dear friend, let the bombs come, if man is mad enough to use them.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   Let hell be let loose over the face of this earth, perhaps in 1962.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.880]   Let it happen.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:05.880]   All I say to you is this, that if you truly believe that Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   that little babe of Bethlehem, was none other than the Lord of glory,
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   the Lord of peace, the eternal Son of God,
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.880]   and that he came into this world to reconcile you to God by his life and death and resurrection,
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   and if you are in him, well, I say this to you,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.880]   let the world be blown to nothing.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   You need have no fear.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   You need not lose a moment of that blessed peace.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.880]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.880]   He has gone there to prepare a place.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   And no bomb of a well has so many megatons that men may make in his madness and devilry.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   They can't touch it.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   The many mansions are founded upon the rock of Adias,
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   beyond the reach of the malignity and the evil and the power of man.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.880]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.880]   And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself,
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.880]   that where I am, there ye may be also.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.880]   What an offer!
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   Here's the Christmas wish and benediction.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:33.880]   The Lord of peace himself give you his peace always and by all means.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.880]   What, says someone, do you really mean that that's for me?
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   Do you know, I have not believed in God until tonight.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.880]   I didn't believe in Christ.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.880]   I thought this was a fairy tale.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.880]   I thought this was a lot of nonsense.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   I didn't believe in the cross and in the death of the Son of God for me and my sins.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   And my dear sir, if you but knew the kind of life I've lived, you'd never say that to me.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.880]   There's not a sin but that I've committed it.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.880]   There's not a commendment but that I've broken it.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   And prided myself in doing it and bursted of it.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.880]   I've blasphemed the name of God and that Christ of yours.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.880]   Are you offering me this peace?
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   I have his authority for doing so.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.880]   I read this.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   He came, says the apostle Paul to the Ephesians, and preached peace to them that are afar off
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   and to them that are nigh.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   He was just repeating what the prophet Isaiah had already prophesied in the 57th chapter of his prophecy.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   As he saw the coming of the Lord of Peace.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.880]   Peace to whom?
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   Not only to the Jews, the people who are nigh, the people whom God had prepared.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.880]   Peace, peace to them that are afar off.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   The prodigals in the far country, the men who are living in the gutters of vice and evil and sin.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.880]   Doesn't matter what you are.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   If you see a need of peace,
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   if you cry out unto God in your restlessness and dis-ease,
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.880]   just where you are, he'll give it you.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   You remember Francis Thompson's way of putting it?
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   Yea.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   When so said, thou canst no sadder cry.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.880]   And upon thy so sore loss shall shine the traffic of Jacob's ladder,
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:29.880]   pitched betwixt heaven and sharing cross.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   Oh, just where you are, in the gutter,
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   sunk, degraded, hopeless, vile, unable to forgive yourself any longer.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.880]   Can I have peace? Yes. Cry.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.880]   And upon thy so sore loss
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   shall shine the traffic of Jacob's ladder,
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   pitched betwixt heaven and just where you are, sharing cross.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.880]   Yes, it's for you, my friend.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   Peace, peace to them that are afar off
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   and to them that are nigh.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   The Lord of peace himself
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:23.880]   gave you his peace always
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.880]   and by all means.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.880]   Ask him for it in faith believing
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   and he'll give it you.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.880]   Blessed be his holy name.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.880]   Amen.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
