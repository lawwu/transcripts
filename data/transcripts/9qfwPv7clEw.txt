[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   I am standing on the edge of the cliff the entire night.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.840]   And if I mess something up, mess it up,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.440]   what even is a mistake?
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.520]   But if I do a little clunker or whatever it is,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.260]   it's like, so what?
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260]   I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.080]   if I wasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.360]   like wild.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.480]   - Why are you standing on the edge of the cliff?
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.460]   - Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.740]   (air whooshing)
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.180]   - The following is a conversation with Tal Wilkenfeld,
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.980]   a singer songwriter, bassist, guitarist,
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.700]   and a true musician who has recorded and performed
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.740]   with many legendary artists, including Jeff Beck,
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.180]   Prince, Eric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.300]   Mick Jagger, Jackson Browne, Rod Stewart,
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.820]   David Gilmour, Pharrell, Hans Zimmer, and many, many more.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.580]   This was a fun and fascinating conversation.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.460]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.540]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.820]   in the description.
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.500]   And now, dear friends, here's Tal Wilkenfeld.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.380]   There's a legendary video of you playing with Jeff Beck.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.860]   We're actually watching it in the background now.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.980]   So for people who don't know,
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.240]   Jeff is one of the greatest guitarists ever.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   So you were playing with him at the 2007 Crossroads Festival
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.700]   and people should definitely watch that video.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.980]   You were killing it on the bass.
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.320]   Look at that bass.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.300]   (laughs)
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.220]   Were you scared?
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.060]   What was that experience like?
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.900]   Were you nervous?
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.180]   You don't look nervous.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.900]   - Yeah, yeah, I wasn't nervous.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.900]   I think that you can get an adrenaline rush before a stage,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.140]   which is natural, but I think as soon as you bring fear
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.100]   to a bandstand, you're limiting yourself.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.340]   You're kind of like walling yourself off from everyone else.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.940]   If you're afraid, what is there to be afraid of?
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.900]   You must be afraid of making a mistake
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.540]   and therefore you're coming at it as a perfectionist
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.020]   and you can't come at music that way
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.460]   or it's not gonna be as expansive and vulnerable and true.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.460]   So no, I was excited and passionate
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.300]   and having the best time.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   And also the fact that he gave me this solo.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.900]   The context of this performance is that
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.580]   this was a guitar festival.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.700]   It's one of the biggest guitar festivals in the world
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.060]   'cause it's Eric Clapton's festival.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.540]   And there's like 400 guitarists
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.900]   that are all playing solos all night.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.380]   And we were like towards the end of the night.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.780]   And I could tell Jeff got a kick out of,
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.300]   I'm not gonna solo on one of my most well-known songs,
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.260]   "Cosmoven and His Lovers."
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.460]   Well, Stevie Wonder wrote it,
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.580]   but people know Jeff for that song and his solo on it.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.300]   It's like, I'm gonna give it to my bass player.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   And he did.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.820]   And the fact that he's bowing,
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.300]   he didn't have to do that.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.060]   - Well, you really stepped up there.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.020]   - It just shows what a generous musician he is.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.620]   And that's evident in his playing across the board.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.340]   He is a generous, loving, open musician.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.180]   He's not there for himself.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.860]   He's there for the music.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.700]   And he thought, well,
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.940]   this would be the perfect musical thing to do.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.620]   And it kind of all started
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.500]   like when I went to audition for him,
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.460]   which was an interesting experience
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.060]   because I got food poisoning on the plane.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.580]   And so like literally when the plane landed,
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.260]   I went straight into an ambulance,
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.620]   into the hospital overnight.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.060]   The manager picked me up and I showed up at Jeff's door,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.620]   which is like a three hour drive,
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.260]   like through windy country roads.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.220]   And he answered the door and he's like,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220]   "Okay, you ready to play?"
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   So we went upstairs and started like rattling off the set.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.780]   And when it came to this song, "Cosmoven and His Lovers,"
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.700]   he just said solo.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.740]   And he loved it and kept the solo in it.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.580]   So that's kind of how,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.500]   'cause there was no bass solo
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.740]   before I was playing in his band.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.020]   So this whole thing was kind of new.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.180]   - So even with food poisoning, like you could step up.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.380]   - Yeah.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.860]   - That's just like what, instinct?
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.380]   - It's just being able to differentiate
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.820]   from like the body and from like expression music.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.100]   - All right. - Yeah.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.940]   - You know, it's interesting,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.740]   you said fear walls you off from the other musicians.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.300]   And what are you afraid of?
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.540]   You're afraid of making a mistake.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.300]   You know, Beethoven said,
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.620]   "To play a wrong note is insignificant.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.140]   "To play without passion is inexcusable."
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.980]   - Yeah.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.860]   - Do you think the old man had a point?
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.020]   - Yeah.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.020]   Different styles of music invite varying degrees of,
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.580]   I would say, uncertainty or unsafety
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.740]   in the way that people might perceive it.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.900]   So for instance, like the tour that I was just on,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.020]   like playing all my brother's songs,
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.460]   like I am standing on the edge of the cliff
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.500]   the entire night.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.460]   And if I, you know, mess something up, mess it up,
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.220]   like what even is a mistake?
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.300]   But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is,
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.620]   it's like, so what?
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.020]   Like I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.860]   if I wasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff,
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.380]   like wild.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.020]   And so I don't care about those few little things.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.820]   I care about the overall expression.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.020]   And then there's other gigs that, you know,
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.820]   for instance, if I got called for like a pop
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.300]   or a country session or a show,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.620]   in those environments, they may want you to play safe.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.100]   Like just play the part and play it
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.140]   with a great groove and time and great dynamics
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.260]   and don't really veer away from the part and stuff.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.100]   And I've done plenty of those gigs too.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.700]   It's just a different like hat you put on.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.660]   - What do you get from the veering,
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.700]   from the veering off the beaten path?
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.020]   You just love it?
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.500]   Or is that gonna make the performance better?
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.260]   Like why are you standing on the edge of the cliff?
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.820]   - Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.220]   and unknown.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.460]   You don't know what's coming.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.780]   And I love being there in the unknown.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.860]   Otherwise it's just like, well, why are we doing this?
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.580]   Am I just like a clown on stage,
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.300]   like showing you my skills or what, you know,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.820]   what I've studied in my bedroom?
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.340]   It's like, no, like I wanna be like pure expression
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.860]   happening right now and responding in real time
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.660]   to everything that's happening.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.940]   And anytime I'm not doing that,
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.460]   it's like it's a waste of everybody's time.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.220]   - Have you ever messed it up real bad?
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.060]   - Mess what up?
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.660]   - I mean, you know, comedians bomb,
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.780]   you're a big fan of comedy.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.620]   - Yeah.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.060]   - Have you ever bombed on stage?
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.180]   - Probably.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.660]   I think it's all about recovery, you know,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.660]   and the more times that you fall off the cliff,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.060]   the quicker you know how to recover
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.060]   and the varying ways that you can recover
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.700]   to the point in which it's concealed so much
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.460]   that maybe a listener might not even know
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.860]   that you're recovering.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.980]   - And eventually you learn to fly
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.460]   if you take that metaphor all the way off the cliff.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.540]   You know, you learn, all right.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.900]   - I remember one time when I was really young,
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.940]   well, not really young, but like when I was 21 or 22.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.260]   - What is aging?
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.660]   But when I was first playing with Jeff Beck
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.580]   and we played at what I consider the best,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.460]   the coolest jazz festival, it's Montreux Jazz.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.740]   And like Miles played there, everyone played there
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.300]   and they have the best speaker system ever.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.460]   I was excited for months.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.420]   And the drummer Vinny was like practicing
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.740]   for like eight hours in the bus on the way there.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.380]   And everyone was like on fire on stage.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.940]   And I remember playing a note, just one note
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.060]   that I really didn't like.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.860]   And I let it go in the moment on stage,
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.380]   but as soon as I got off stage, I was really sad.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.420]   And so I sat like on this road case,
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.460]   everyone was out celebrating.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.380]   I like sat on this road case with a sad face like,
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.220]   boo hoo.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.060]   And then Claude Knobbs, like the owner of the,
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.660]   you know, the whole festival came up to me.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.660]   He's like, "Dahl, what's wrong?"
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.220]   And I'm like, "I played a bad note."
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.740]   (laughing)
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.660]   I was such a child.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.580]   And like he said all this wise stuff that, you know,
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.980]   Miles Davis had imparted to him
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.620]   and like it fully cheered me up.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.100]   He's like, "Is there anything that would make you
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.940]   feel better?"
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.340]   And I was like, "Caviar."
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.500]   (laughing)
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.100]   The dude came back 10 minutes later with this huge thing.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.940]   - Oh, wow.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.780]   - It was a joke.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.580]   It was a joke, but he actually brought me caviar.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.460]   But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being sad
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.060]   about a performance.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.100]   Now I'm just like, okay, whatever, like it's done.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.380]   - Was it a physical slip of like the fingers
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.900]   or was it, did you intend to play that note?
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.820]   - That I can't remember.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.060]   I can't remember if it was just a bad choice
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.980]   that sounded like a clangor or why it happened.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.820]   It was so long ago,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.140]   but I don't get depressed about that anymore.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.780]   - That'd be funny if that was like your biggest
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.580]   and only regret in life is that note
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.580]   that haunted you in your dreams.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.260]   - And then like, you know, like I'm on my deathbed
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.020]   and just everyone's just bringing me caviar.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.500]   (laughing)
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.860]   - Joke went way too far.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.900]   You talked about confidence somewhere.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.540]   I don't remember where.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.500]   So I wanna ask you about how much confidence it takes
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.340]   to be up there.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.420]   You said something that Anthony Jackson told you
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.740]   as encouragement, a line that I really like that quote,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.100]   "On your worst day, you're still a bad motherfucker."
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.220]   - That's actually a Steve Gadd quote.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.340]   And Steve used to tell that to Anthony
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.140]   'cause Anthony used to get real depressed
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.140]   if he did a wrong thing or not perfect thing.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.220]   And Steve Gadd used to say this to Anthony Jackson.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.540]   And then Anthony was my first bass mentor
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.100]   or just mentor in general.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.100]   - For people who don't know, he's a legendary bassist.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.300]   - He's a legendary bassist.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.140]   And I started playing the bass when I was 17
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.380]   and I moved to New York and I met Anthony
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.620]   and he started mentoring me, but in a very not typical way.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.140]   Like he would just sit in his car with me for hours
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.580]   and talk music.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.700]   - You guys just listen to music and analyze it.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.540]   - Exactly.
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.780]   And that was the best form of learning, I think.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.860]   Just like, well, what do you perceive here?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.260]   And well, I heard this and just discussing that.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.660]   - Jazz usually or?
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.260]   - No, all styles of music.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.180]   And yeah, he told me that story about on your worst day
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.020]   because like, yeah, even then, like when I was like 18, 19,
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.460]   I get sad sometimes about performances.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.580]   Like I could have done this.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.060]   It's like, I don't do that anymore, thankfully.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.260]   Or I'd be miserable.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.500]   - So you always kind of feel pretty good.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.140]   - Yeah, yeah, now I do.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.980]   Now it's just, I sense the body feeling fatigued,
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.660]   especially if it's a very long show,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.860]   like the ones I just did with three hour shows
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.540]   and we did one to three hour sound checks.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.140]   So that's a lot of physical activity every day.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.100]   So I just feel the body being tired, like fatigued.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.460]   The ears are fatigued.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.780]   That's about it.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.140]   I don't really reflect on the show much.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.140]   - You're almost like from a third person perspective,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.980]   feel the body get tired and just accept it.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.660]   - Yeah, I don't want to identify with it
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.860]   'cause then I'm tired, but I'm not tired.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.060]   I'm usually like energized.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.300]   - It's like with the food poisoning,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.900]   the mind is still capable of creative genius,
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.300]   even if the body is gone, something like that.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.300]   So no self-critical component
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.340]   to the way you see your performances anymore?
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.460]   - There is critique,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.460]   but not in the way that it would diminish my sense of self.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.940]   It's different.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.380]   I can just kind of look at something and be like,
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.180]   okay, well, actually next time I'll do this choice
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.700]   and this choice maybe.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.540]   Maybe this would serve the song better.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.180]   Maybe this would help the groove feel more like this,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.780]   but it's not like I suck because I did this
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.700]   and I'm a loser.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.620]   - Do you think that's bad?
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.540]   'Cause even when I asked that question,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.140]   I had a self-critical thought,
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.660]   then why'd you ask that question?
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.900]   That's the wrong question.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.780]   I always have the self-critical engine running.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.980]   Is it necessarily a bad thing?
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.460]   - It depends if it's affecting you negatively.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.860]   - What is negative anyway?
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.420]   - Well, if it brings your frequency down
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.940]   and you feel less joyful inside,
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.180]   unless you don't feel complete,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.260]   you feel less than, less worthy of something,
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.060]   then you could call that bad
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.980]   if you aspire to not feel that way.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.340]   - Yeah, I aspire to not feel that way in the big picture.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.060]   But in the little picture,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.780]   like there's a little pain is good.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.940]   - That's fair.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.260]   - So confidence, you seem like in this performance,
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.900]   you seem confident.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.900]   You seem to be truly walking the bad motherfucker way of life.
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.980]   - I kind of, a word that I prefer over confidence is trust.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.700]   Because I think with confidence is almost like
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.060]   there's a belief assigned to it
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.940]   that I am this thing that you believe in.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.220]   Whereas trust is just simply knowing
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.660]   that you can get up there
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.460]   and handle whatever is gonna come your way.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.180]   And it's more of an open feeling where it's like,
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.380]   yeah, I could do this, sure.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.820]   But not like, I'm a bad motherfucker.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.460]   Like, you know what I mean?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.940]   There's a huge difference.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.660]   'Cause I've shared the stage with people
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.420]   who have a lot of confidence.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.540]   And it can be like a brick wall,
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.340]   just like fear is a brick wall.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.180]   - So the brick wall is a bad thing.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.380]   Like the thing you have with Jeff here on stage-
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.220]   - Is not a brick wall.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.180]   - There's no wall, there's chemistry.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.860]   How can you explain that chemistry, the two you had?
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860]   - Trust and lack of fear, yeah.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.980]   And also I will say that each individual
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.780]   has developed likes and dislikes over their lifetime.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.940]   And that can be like, in this case,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.980]   we're just talking aesthetic likes and dislikes.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.420]   So in this particular case,
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.220]   obviously our likes and dislikes are very much aligned
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.980]   such that the things I do to compliment him,
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.900]   he enjoys and vice versa.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.900]   But it could be two very trusting, open musicians on stage
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.220]   that don't have walls up,
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.340]   but their choices are very different.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.540]   And one person likes heavy metal
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.060]   and the other person likes classical.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.420]   So it's gotta be both.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.260]   - So you guys were good at like,
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.020]   yes, anding each other musically.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.900]   - Definitely.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.900]   - Is that where you're most at peace
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.740]   in a meditative way, is on stage?
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.260]   - It used to be that it would only be on stage.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.300]   It started with that.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.820]   That was almost like my way in to flow state
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.980]   and meditation was playing music.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   And then back in the day when I'd kind of crash after shows,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.140]   I wanted to change that.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.980]   I wanted to always feel like I'm in flow state.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.900]   So. - Have you succeeded?
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.520]   - I've gotten a lot better.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.060]   I'm still obviously on the journey, but yes.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.900]   - So you meditate,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.620]   I think you've said somewhere that you meditate
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.740]   before shows or just in general?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.300]   - I meditate every day.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.900]   When I'm on tour with my band,
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   I ask that we all meditate together
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.860]   for at least 20 minutes.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.700]   And I don't dictate which type of meditation.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.380]   I don't put on a guided meditation
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.860]   'cause everyone has their own thing they wanna do.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.660]   Maybe someone might be praying in their head.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.500]   It doesn't matter.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.220]   It's just the idea that we all put our phones down
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.660]   and we all are in one room connecting
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.140]   energetically, spiritually,
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.140]   and just letting our lives go for a second.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.340]   And then we walk straight on the stage
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.100]   and it's always really connected.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.260]   And there were a couple of gigs
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.340]   where we ran out of time for that.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.460]   And I could tell there was a major difference
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.420]   in the performance.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.580]   - So it both connects you and centers you,
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.180]   all of those things.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.940]   - Yeah, but then when I'm home, I love to meditate
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.220]   and I've tried various styles of meditation
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.700]   and studied various types of things.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.060]   So I don't do just one thing.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.220]   I kind of customize it depending on
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.460]   where I'm at in my life.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.040]   - You and the world lost Jeff back a year ago.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.500]   You told me you really miss him.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.620]   How's the pain of losing Jeff change you?
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.820]   Maybe deepen your sense of the world?
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.980]   - You know, it's hard to accept
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.540]   that we won't create something musically again
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.180]   in this lifetime.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:58.420]   But in terms of the grief,
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.140]   grief was easier for me
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.180]   because I went through a major grief period
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.340]   in 2016 and 17.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.220]   And that was the first time I'd really gone through
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.780]   the process of grief
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:23.020]   like in a non-family situation,
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.300]   like with friends and mentors and people
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.500]   that I'd created with, which is different.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.300]   It's a different kind of connection.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.100]   When my grandparents died,
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.500]   it's like there was nothing left unsaid
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.980]   and I was at peace with what was happening.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.060]   With this, when Prince died out of the blue
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.660]   in mid 2016, and then Leonard Cohen died in November,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.140]   that just tore me to shreds
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.980]   because Leonard Cohen was not just someone
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.900]   that profoundly inspired me musically and lyrically,
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.300]   but spiritually, we had a very deep connection.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.580]   And that was the basis of a lot of our conversation
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.100]   was spirituality.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.540]   And so at that time,
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.100]   I felt like a piece of me went missing.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.340]   And that was a very long process
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.300]   where I just stayed in my place
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   and didn't wanna play a note of music.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.860]   I kinda wanted to just get rid of all my stuff.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.140]   So I had a friend come over and he's like,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.100]   "You should just, why don't you come to the comedy store?"
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.020]   I'm like, "Comedy store?
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.340]   "What am I gonna go to some store and buy clown suits?
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.180]   "What are you talking about?
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.420]   "What's a comedy store?"
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.380]   He's like, "No, no, no, the comedy store,
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.260]   "the place where comedians go."
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.660]   I'm like, "Okay, well, I've never seen standup.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.300]   "I've seen Seinfeld on TV.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.660]   "That's the extent of my standup experience."
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.340]   So he took me to the comedy store
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.020]   and every single one of those comedians
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.220]   embraced me like I was family.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.020]   It didn't even take a day.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:18.020]   I was part of the family and I made 25 best friends.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.940]   And I ended up throwing all my stuff in storage
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.260]   and finding a little room to stay in
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.820]   where I rented my gear out.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:34.180]   And that was me, my rent paying was me loaning the gear
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.700]   'cause I didn't want any responsibilities, financial.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.580]   I just wanted to be completely free
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.540]   so that I could just process it
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.820]   and not feel like I had to commit to anything
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.180]   work-wise or creatively.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.260]   I just wanted to unplug.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.380]   And so this was a fun and very different way to unplug
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.820]   because previously I may have just gone to a monastery
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.140]   and spent weeks at a monastery or months.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.460]   But in this case, I was like, "You know what?
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.100]   "This is a different kind of experience.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.620]   "I'm gonna just hang out with comedians
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.340]   "and stay in this room."
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.700]   - With no responsibility really.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.340]   - Yeah, other than to really deeply connect
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.340]   with this grief that I'm experiencing.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.300]   I'm not going to negate it.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.300]   I'm gonna really fully connect to it.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.980]   And I did and it was tough.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.660]   And then more people in 2017 were leaving,
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.780]   Greg Almond, Tom Petty.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.340]   I mean, it was like, these are people that I,
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.900]   I worked with all these people
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.220]   and had great connections with them.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.180]   And they were all going and the world was mourning
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.100]   the loss of these people because of everything
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.460]   that they'd given to the world.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.500]   Like they'd changed the world's lives,
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.380]   not just mine 'cause I knew them personally.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.140]   And so that was also complicated
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.140]   and why for me, it was interesting to be grieving
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.620]   the loss of these musicians with comedians.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.380]   And I learned a lot.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   It changed my life 'cause I just learned to,
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.140]   I learned to laugh at absolutely anything, everything.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.820]   I mean, my grandpa had a really great sense of humor too.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.660]   My grandpa's a Holocaust survivor
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.900]   and like he could just kind of like laugh at anything.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.060]   And like, so I already kind of have that in me,
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.380]   but being around all these comedians
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.660]   just kind of like exaggerated that for me.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.380]   And that really changed things for me for the better.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.580]   So then when Jeff Beck died, it was like,
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.940]   okay, I've got these tools.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.020]   I know what this is.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.860]   And I'm gonna go through it again.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.260]   And I'm gonna be on tour with Incubus in two days.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.220]   - Yeah.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.700]   - And so Mike Dernt from Green Day, he called me up
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.060]   and he said, "Hey, like I know you're going through a lot."
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.780]   And I said, "Yeah, I don't even know what I'm gonna play.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.940]   Like I really want a vintage jazz bass for this.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.620]   And I only have a seventies one
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.060]   that I don't really think is appropriate.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.540]   I really need a sixties one, blah, blah, blah."
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.300]   And Mike's like, "I'm gonna hook you up."
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.780]   He showed up to my place the next day
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.780]   with a truckload of old P basses and jazz basses
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.580]   and brought them all into my studio and I'm playing them.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.100]   And then I pull one out of the case
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.500]   and it's Olympic white, just like Jeff Beck.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   And I play it and not only did I get goosebumps
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.060]   and started crying, but I looked over at Mike
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.180]   and same thing was happening.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.180]   And he's like, "I guess Jeff might be happy about this."
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:42.740]   And he's like, "Well, I didn't wanna let this one go.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.540]   I was just trying to cheer you up a bit
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.300]   and maybe loan it to you for the tour.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.300]   But if you really want it, it's yours."
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.380]   And I was like, "Oh my God, this is like,
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.820]   like what a, like Mike Dernt is the nicest guy ever."
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.300]   So that happened, so that bass's name is Jeff
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.740]   and it's a white jazz bass
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.820]   and I played it on the Incubus Tour.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.300]   But yeah, I do feel like I'm more equipped
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.700]   to handle grief now.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.140]   - Tell me about the comedy store a little bit more.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.620]   Do you think comedians and musicians
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.220]   in some deep fundamental way are made from the same cloth?
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.740]   Like are they spiritually connected somehow?
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.540]   - I think everyone's connected spiritually
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.700]   in the same way.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.740]   So I think personality wise,
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.220]   comedians and musicians are quite different actually.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.060]   - In what way?
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.980]   - Well, you'd have to subdivide even musicians
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.740]   into different categories too,
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.940]   because the thing that I appreciate about comedians
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.660]   is that you go to a restaurant with them
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.380]   and like all the observational humor of like,
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.020]   they'll notice everything and make you laugh about it.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.460]   Which a really great songwriter does the same thing too.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.860]   And my favorite lyricists, like Leonard Cohen,
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.260]   Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Warren Ziva,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.380]   and they add comedy into their lyric.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.300]   And like, so those types of people,
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.700]   I would liken to hanging out with a comedian.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.740]   It's very different from like, say somebody
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.460]   that is an instrumental guitarist or something like that,
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.380]   that they're more focused on,
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.180]   whether it's like a kinesthetic thing
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.780]   or like a physical thing or whatever it is,
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.060]   they're not quite doing the observational thing
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.020]   in the same way.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.300]   So I just appreciate like,
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.020]   my favorite thing to do is go out and laugh,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.820]   especially 'cause like I can tend to be pretty analytical
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.980]   and be in my head.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:50.740]   And so anything that just kind of lets me be in my heart
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.260]   and just enjoy life.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.380]   - I think there's a photo of you
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.380]   with Dave Chappelle on stage.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.420]   What was that about?
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.460]   - So right after Leonard Cohen passed away,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.020]   the comedy store threw me a birthday party.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.220]   It was this crazy lineup.
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.300]   And like, it was like, I'd play a song with my band
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.660]   and then Jackson Brown sat in and like sung a song.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.340]   And then like Dave Chappelle came up and said some jokes.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.420]   It was like one of my favorite nights ever.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.340]   It was cool.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.660]   It was a very healing birthday party.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.700]   - Yeah, there's something magical about that place.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.220]   - Yeah. - It's really special.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.660]   - Yeah, well, the mothership has some magic to it too.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.580]   It's really cool.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.420]   It's different, totally different vibe,
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.060]   but like super awesome.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.940]   - You've said that Leonard Cohen
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.220]   is a songwriting inspiration of yours.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.940]   I saw you perform a song, "Chelsea Hotel," brilliantly
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.780]   on the internet.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.780]   It's about, for people who don't know,
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.580]   is his love affair with Janet Joplin.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.380]   How does that song make you feel?
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.500]   - Great, I love that song.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.380]   - Which aspect, musically, the melancholy feeling,
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.380]   the hopeful feeling, the cocky feeling,
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.500]   all of it, like every single line
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.300]   has a different feeling to it, really.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   - Yeah, but as a whole piece, I appreciate it so much.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.260]   I actually lived at the Chelsea Hotel.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.460]   And when Leonard and I first met,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.460]   that was one of the first things we talked about
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.460]   was that I lived there where all that stuff went down
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.620]   before they tore it apart.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.620]   And yeah, it's just a beautiful song.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.620]   - You know, what makes me sad, the way it ends,
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.420]   I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.740]   I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.700]   I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, that's all.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.180]   I don't even think of you that often.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.500]   You know that line, I don't even think of you that often,
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.620]   always breaks my heart for some reason.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.020]   Like how ephemeral, how short-lasting
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.300]   certain love affairs can be.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.120]   Just kind of like, huh.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.900]   - Yeah.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.720]   - Do you think he meant it?
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.200]   - I always think he's trying to convince himself of it.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.320]   - It could be both or either, you know?
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.520]   I mean, that's the beautiful thing about poetry and lyric
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.120]   is that it's supposed to be open.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.040]   - Yeah, I wonder if it's also open to him,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.480]   depending on the day, you know?
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.960]   - Definitely, I mean, the thing that he taught me
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.400]   or his advice to me was when you're writing a song,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.800]   look at it the next morning,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.080]   like just first thing and read it,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.080]   and then take a walk, smoke a joint, read it again.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:55.400]   Go have a fight with your daughter, come back, read it again.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.800]   Get drunk, read it again.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.160]   Wait a week, read it again.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.920]   Just so that, you know, from every state
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   and every position, the wider the lens is gonna be
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.540]   from an audience perspective.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.120]   You want things to mean multiple things.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.160]   - So there's one line I read somewhere
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.480]   that he regrets putting in the song.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.680]   So I've got to ask you about it, it's pretty edgy.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.320]   It's about giving me head on the unmade bed.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.160]   - Yeah.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.000]   - You think that's a good line or bad line?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.360]   - I think it's an amazing line.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.960]   It's one of the best lines in the song.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.800]   - Yeah, right?
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.360]   - When he put that song out,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.780]   obviously he didn't regret it
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.680]   or he wouldn't have put that lyric in the song.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.200]   I think what happened was that eventually word got out
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.000]   either from him or from somebody else
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.160]   that the song was about Janis Joplin.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.000]   - Yes.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.200]   - And so at that point, he regretted the indiscretion.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.600]   So it wasn't that he regretted how great the line was.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.400]   It was just, you know, the privacy factor.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   But then again, Leonard's known for rewriting his lyrics.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.040]   In his live shows, you'll see a bunch of songs
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.880]   where it's like new lyrics.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.440]   And he didn't do it 'cause he didn't like the old lyrics.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.200]   He just did it because he could, 'cause he's Leonard.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.720]   And it's like, why not have fun with words
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.600]   the way musicians have fun, you know,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.800]   improvising solos on stage.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.960]   And he could have changed that line in "Chelsea Hotel"
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.920]   after in retrospect, and he never did.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.680]   - I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.440]   You were talking so brave and so sweet,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.960]   giving me head on the unmade bed
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.360]   while the limousines wait in the street.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.560]   - It's so powerful.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.400]   - It's a powerful line.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.000]   It just kind of shocks you.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.600]   - Well, that's what's so great about it.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.880]   - But also heartbreaking 'cause it doesn't last.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.720]   Especially, actually to me, it adds more meaning
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.000]   once you know it's Janis Joplin.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.600]   It's like, okay, these two stars kind of collided for a time.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.280]   - Yeah, but why is it heartbreaking?
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.640]   It could also be just beautiful
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.680]   that they had a little fling.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.800]   - Yeah, everything's beautiful.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.640]   - Thank you.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.800]   - Even the dark stuff.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.980]   What's not beautiful?
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.640]   Everything is beautiful.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.720]   - If you look long enough and deeply enough.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.920]   What were we saying?
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.840]   Oh, what do you think about "Hallelujah"?
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.080]   Like, what do you think about the different songs of his?
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.360]   And why'd you choose Chelsea Hotel to perform?
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.720]   - Because I lived there and it was like,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.920]   it meant something to me to sing that song.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.720]   And actually, when I put that song out on YouTube,
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.000]   that's when he sent me an email.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.080]   He's like, "Hey, do you wanna come over?"
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.120]   - Nice.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.600]   So this is how you guys connected.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.400]   - No, we met in a rehearsal studio.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.200]   I ended up watching their whole rehearsal
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.480]   and sitting there next to Roshi,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   his like 105-year-old monk, which was really great.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.960]   I remember when I was like shaking his hand.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.440]   So I was like, it was just me and Roshi on the couch
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.560]   watching Leonard with his band.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.200]   And we're shaking hands and he grips my hand like this,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.880]   so it like doesn't let it go.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.280]   And he said, he looked at my eyes and he said,
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.920]   "Where are you?"
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.640]   And I said, "In the handshake."
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.480]   Yes.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.800]   - Wow, you passed the test.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.560]   - Passed the Roshi test.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.760]   And then what's funny was that the next thing
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.720]   that happened about five minutes later
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.920]   was Leonard Cohen got down on his knees
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.240]   and opened up a jar, I'm not kidding you, of caviar.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.680]   This is not a callback.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.040]   - Well, it is in a way.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.880]   - I know, I know.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.080]   - In a deep, fundamental way.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.040]   - He started feeding the monk caviar.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.880]   - Yeah.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.920]   - And that healed my Montreux Jazz Festival
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.840]   sadness forever.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.080]   The end.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.320]   - Do you think there's a kind of like weird,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.120]   like there's a sense of humor to it all somehow?
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.760]   Like, why does that happen?
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.060]   Why does that happen?
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.280]   Why stuff like that happens?
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.080]   Or that the Jeff Bass speaks to you?
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.160]   - Why do we need to know?
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.400]   - You believe in that stuff?
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.280]   - In what stuff?
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.960]   - That there's a rhyme to the whole thing
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.240]   somehow, like there's a frequency to which
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.280]   magical things of that nature can happen.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:23.480]   - I'm divided about that answer
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.120]   because I think just things are flowing.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.700]   I don't think anything's kind of like planned out.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.840]   Like through time, it's like an orchestra playing
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   of different experiences and circumstances
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.600]   that are somehow connected.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.800]   - I think everything's connected, so yes.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.360]   - But predetermined means like--
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   - I don't believe in that predetermined stuff necessarily,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   which is different from whatever your previous karma is.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.440]   And karma's a whole other kind of conversation.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.160]   I don't mean karma as in like good karma, bad karma,
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.880]   just karma meaning the collection of things
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.760]   you've acquired over this lifetime or other lifetimes.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   Just whatever that is is going to influence your future.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.800]   - Well, you had a really interesting trajectory through life.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.280]   Maybe I just read it that way
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.120]   because I've had a lot of stuff happen to me
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.520]   that's like lucky, feels lucky.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.160]   And sometimes I wonder like, huh?
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.640]   This is weird.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.000]   It does feel like the universe just kind of
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.540]   throws stuff at you with a chuckle.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.400]   I don't know, not you, the proverbial you.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.160]   - One, yeah.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.200]   - You said you sometimes watch classic movies
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.920]   to inspire your songwriting
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.040]   and you mentioned watching "Taxi Driver."
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.000]   I love that movie.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.600]   And I think you mentioned that you wrote a love song
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.120]   based on that movie.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.400]   So Travis Bickle, for people who don't know,
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.000]   is a taxi driver.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.040]   And he's deeply lonely.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.360]   What do you think about that kind of loneliness?
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.440]   - I think that loneliness is a product
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.280]   of feeling separate from the world
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.120]   and separate from others.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.760]   And that the less you experience that separation,
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.080]   the less you'll feel lonely.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.680]   - How often have you felt lonely in this way?
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.360]   Separated from the rest of the world?
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.000]   - It's less and less every single year.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.880]   'Cause I work very hard at it.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.000]   - Feeling a part of the world?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.560]   - Yeah, just meditating and studying scriptures.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.600]   - Don't you think that, I mean,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.640]   isn't there a fundamental loneliness to human experience?
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.720]   Just-- - In what sense?
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.360]   - That all the struggles, all the suffering you experience
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.840]   is really experienced by you alone?
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.120]   - Is it?
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   - Maybe at the very bottom it's not.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.200]   - It's kind of all the same stuff.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.000]   - You didn't feel alone in 2016, 2017?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.840]   - I felt like I lost a piece of myself
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.600]   that I had given to somebody else.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   And I feel like people feel that in romantic exchanges,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.480]   whether it's long-term, short-term.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.320]   You give a piece of yourself,
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.080]   and then if that person dies
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.200]   or you break up with that person,
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.280]   you feel like you've lost that piece of yourself,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.280]   which I feel like is a very different experience
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.240]   than if you just are opening yourself
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.720]   rather than giving a piece of yourself.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.880]   You're just opening yourself to somebody or something.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.920]   - So opening is fundamentally not a lonely experience?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.560]   - Mm-mm, no, it's a loving experience.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.240]   - And then losing a piece of yourself can be?
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.320]   - Yeah, 'cause you can't really,
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.880]   you can't lose a piece of yourself
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.520]   if you are the same self as every other self.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.160]   - Right, right, so if you see yourself
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.880]   as together with everybody, then there's no losing.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.080]   It's a beautiful way to look at it.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.520]   You said that there's something healing
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.120]   about being in an empty hotel room
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.600]   with no attachments except your suitcase.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.560]   You know, a lot of people will talk about hotel rooms
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   being a fundamentally lonely experience,
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.760]   but you're saying it's healing.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.360]   - Yeah, 'cause I just get to sit there
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.320]   and not worry about all this stuff,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.640]   these meaningless attachments.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.280]   I've got my suitcase with my necessities,
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.600]   or my three suitcases sometimes. (laughs)
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.400]   And I can just sit there and meditate
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.240]   and just be with myself, and it's so awesome.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.760]   And usually, like, you plan your touring for,
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.480]   like, you know, you kind of get the business aspect
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.080]   of things taken care of in advance,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.120]   so you can kind of just really be flowing day to day
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.640]   on a tour, and it's a great feeling.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.160]   It's funny because this last tour that I did,
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.240]   we didn't have hotels every night.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.800]   We had hotels maybe like once a week,
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.920]   and I hadn't done that before.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.600]   Usually, I'm frequently in hotels,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.280]   so I didn't get that space
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.920]   that I'm really used to getting.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.400]   - You missed them.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.800]   - I very much missed it and had to be very creative.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   And I ended up, like, going into the back lounge
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.360]   when everyone was asleep and, like, meditating back there,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.320]   or, like, before everyone woke up.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.120]   And I actually, like, joined,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.640]   there was, like, an online meditation retreat
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.480]   that was happening.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.200]   It was, like, 12 hours a day of silent meditations
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.320]   that happens once a year,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.800]   and I love this particular group of people.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.960]   And they knew I was on tour,
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.040]   so they're like, "Just join when you can."
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.720]   And so I was on the tour doing the meditation retreat
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.560]   at the same time.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.840]   It was so fun.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.920]   It was so fun because I was, like, in the back lounge.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.720]   The bus is, like, moving around like this,
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.200]   and my laptop, the Zoom is like, "Zoom, zoom."
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.720]   And I'm just, like, sitting, like, meditating.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.320]   It was like, yeah, this is the shit.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.160]   - Silence.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.240]   So they're all connected through Zoom
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.880]   and just doing silent 12 hours a day?
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.760]   - That's cool.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.800]   - These particular retreats that I started doing,
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.720]   it's not straight silent.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.880]   There are, you know,
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.080]   silence sits every hour for 50 minutes,
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.320]   and then there's some talks.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.200]   And, like, these people that I've been working with
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.640]   are really cool because they're integrating
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.680]   spiral dynamics into zen,
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.880]   and it's, like, the coolest combination.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.120]   - What's spiral dynamics?
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.960]   Like, Ken Wilber, do you know Ken Wilber?
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.280]   Integral theory?
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.920]   - Yes, can you explain a little bit?
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.520]   So I vaguely know of him because of kind of this notion
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.000]   that everything is one,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.200]   like, everything is integrated,
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.440]   that every field has truths and falsehoods,
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.880]   and we should integrate the truths.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.760]   - Yeah, it's hard to explain how it applies
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.240]   to this type of meditation
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:18.160]   because it's in the guided parts of the meditation
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.800]   that this whole, like, holonic theory is, like, brought in
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.280]   about, like, transcending and including
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.680]   every aspect of your being.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   Because he talks about, like, levels of development
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.600]   and, like, in consciousness
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.880]   and how, like, this applies to, like,
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.440]   every single religion or non-religion
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.000]   that there are these levels of development
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.320]   that go all the way up to enlightenment.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.640]   No matter what you start off with,
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.800]   it could be, you know, Christianity, Buddhism, Vedanta,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.360]   doesn't matter, like, anything.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.200]   Then I just like, I like it when everything is,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.160]   and everyone is taken into account.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.840]   It doesn't matter where you're coming from,
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.880]   that there is a way to be self-realized, self-actualized.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.120]   There are self-actualized beings from all walks of life
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.560]   with very, very different paths.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.640]   There's no one path.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.080]   I mean, in this particular retreat I do,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.800]   there's, like, a lot of silent sits,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.000]   and then there's some guided meditations.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.520]   But I've tried a lot of different avenues,
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.920]   and they're all great.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.040]   So I wouldn't just say, "Just try this one thing."
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.320]   Like, I've studied, like, the Upanishads,
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.640]   like, with Vedanta teachers
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.560]   and, like, gone through those texts for months and months
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.720]   and stayed at monasteries,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.280]   and, like, how they break it down
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.080]   makes total sense to my mind and heart,
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.520]   and, like, my, more importantly than my mind,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.320]   like, my inner knowing, like, it resonates.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.720]   - Inner knowing.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.320]   - Yeah, because, like, your mind is, like, the thinking tool.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.880]   Like, it's not you.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.080]   You're not your mind.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.520]   You're not your thoughts.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.520]   You're not your body, you know?
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.520]   So it's, like, just the you.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.680]   Like, that knowing that you have,
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.760]   that's kind of, when something resonates there,
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.400]   that's usually when you go with something.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.320]   - What is living in a monastery like?
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.480]   - It's the best.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.600]   - What are we talking about?
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.440]   Like, what--
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.640]   - It's just an empty room with, like, a tiny single bed
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.440]   and a sheet and a pillow, and that's it.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.280]   - That's it.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.480]   - You have to eat the same thing as everyone.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.440]   - What's the food like?
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.600]   What is it?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.920]   - Very plain, cheap, basic food,
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.000]   which is, you know, funny for someone like me
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.800]   because I'm pretty particular about my diet.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.320]   - You brought over, like, 20 different ingredients.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.720]   - Yeah.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.480]   - So what was the, like,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.320]   day in the life of Tal at a monastery?
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.720]   - You wake up at 5 a.m. to the bell,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   and you go and meditate, like, constantly,
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.200]   till bedtime, other than two meals.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.560]   - How are you sitting?
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.720]   Are you in a group?
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.640]   Is there other people there?
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.160]   And you're just sitting there?
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.440]   - Well, if you're talking about the Zen monastery,
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.240]   'cause I stayed at a Zen monastery,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.920]   and I did a thing with that,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.280]   the guy was telling you about that kind of,
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.080]   the integral Zen thing,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.880]   where he uses Ken Wilber's work in combination with Zen.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.280]   That's a little bit different 'cause he does talks.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.560]   We talk about things.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.680]   And that's very separate from the monastery,
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.200]   like the Vedanta monasteries I've stayed at,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.520]   which there's very little meditation
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.640]   in terms of sitting silently.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.240]   Instead, we are meditating on the scriptures,
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.760]   like the Upanishads, and we're, like, diving into that.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.960]   - What were the differences,
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.200]   the takeaways from the experiences,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.680]   the two different, the integral one
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.320]   and the meditating on scriptures?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.760]   - They're both incredibly,
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.120]   have been incredibly helpful to me
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.600]   because the Vedanta,
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:10.080]   anytime I go into my head about something,
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   the answer is there based on this knowledge.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.880]   And with the Zen monastery, it's like,
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.720]   you just gotta put your butt in the seat and sit and wait,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.000]   and maybe something will happen, maybe it won't,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.400]   but just keep sitting.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   And it's very disciplined, and you go through a lot.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   Your body's purging a lot.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.120]   There's a lot, and you don't necessarily have the answers
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.080]   as to what is happening.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.640]   And so I think for somebody like me, I need both.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.600]   I need to be in a place where there's complete uncertainty,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.560]   but complete discipline,
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.040]   and just doing the regimented thing.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.480]   And then there's the me that feels very satisfied
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.240]   from an analytical standpoint,
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.160]   understanding what's happening,
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.680]   like what is the gross and the subtle body,
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.440]   and I wanna understand these things
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.080]   about what it is to be a human.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   So I like 'em both.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.440]   - Understand what it means to be a human.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.840]   So that, like, having that patience
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.040]   and just sitting with yourself helps you do that?
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.920]   - Yes.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.320]   More so like the analysis part.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.000]   - Oh, so the analysis, the actual, okay, got it.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.440]   - But sitting with yourself, there's no better education
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.280]   of, like, facing every demon,
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.440]   and it's all gonna come out, and it's not gonna be pretty.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.400]   But then there's things that happen on the other side of it
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.360]   that are so profound.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.120]   - Have you met most of your demons?
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.880]   - I've met the demons that have come out.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.800]   - Oh, there may be more.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.640]   - Who knows, yeah.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.800]   - Okay, well, to be continued.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:01.080]   What, since I think I heard you say
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.440]   that you wrote a love song after "Taxi Driver,"
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.520]   what kind of love songs do you write more of?
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.920]   Broken, so you're a songwriter first,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.760]   for people who don't know.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.520]   They might think you're primarily a bassist, but you're--
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.080]   - But they're wrong!
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.640]   - So do you write mostly broken heart ones,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.320]   or hopeful love songs, in love songs,
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   about to be in love songs, soon to fall in love songs?
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.440]   - Well, the last album I put out
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.760]   is pretty self-explanatory as to what that is.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.880]   - A lot of pain, that one?
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.840]   - There was, yeah.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.320]   Some of it was storytelling,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.760]   and some of it was real experience,
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.040]   and it's always a combination of things.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.640]   Like, I serve the song,
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   so sometimes you use your own life experience
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.520]   to tell a song, and sometimes you may watch a movie,
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.120]   and part of that script merges with your own experience,
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.200]   and that tells the right story
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.880]   for the point you're trying to make in the song.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.560]   So it varies from song to song,
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.240]   like in terms of how, what a biographical it is.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.840]   - Yeah, I was at the end of "Taxi Driver"
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.800]   when, what's her name, Betsy,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.360]   because Travis becomes a hero,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.920]   she tries to get with him, and he rejects her.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.360]   Also, that was powerful.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.800]   - My favorite love songs are the ones
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   where you're not sure it's about romantic love,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.080]   or love of God, or love of life,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.880]   or just pure, just love.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.200]   Like, I was thinking George Harrison writes songs like that,
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.520]   like "What is Life?"
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.480]   Or like Bob Dylan's song that George Harrison covered,
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.160]   "If Not for You."
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.600]   - Yeah, just grateful, grateful for his love.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.560]   - Right, right, that's kind of like where,
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.360]   well, what I'm experiencing now,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.720]   and so who knows what'll end up coming out, but.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.840]   - Do you have been writing this kind of?
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.360]   - Yeah, I've been writing.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.200]   - A little bit?
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.000]   - I don't have an intention of putting something out
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.440]   in any particular time frame,
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.960]   but I'm just writing and letting things flow.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   And yeah, there's a bunch of Leonard Cohen songs, too,
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.080]   where you're like, there's so many ways
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.400]   to interpret this song, and there's so many ways.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.040]   I just love songs that aren't so specifically
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.600]   about one thing.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.120]   - You know, I really love the song,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.160]   "To Play It, To Listen to, Wonderful Tonight"
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.480]   by Eric Clapton, and I thought it was pretty straightforward.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.800]   And then I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein,
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.040]   who's a mutual friend of ours,
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.720]   and he told me it's not about what I thought it's about.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.120]   - Oh yeah, what did he say?
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.920]   - It's a more complicated story.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.360]   It's actually a man, so "Wonderful Tonight"
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.360]   is a story about a man just finding his wife beautiful
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.280]   and appreciating it throughout.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.520]   But he said it was actually a man missing his wife,
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   that he's imagining that she's lost
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.560]   because of the decisions he's made in his life.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.440]   So it's pain.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.720]   And he had a long, beautiful Eric Weinstein-like explanation
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.600]   of why. - I love this.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.000]   - Have you and Eric played music?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.400]   - No, we just hung out and had very long conversations
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.520]   about everything.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.920]   - He's a bit of a musician, you know?
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.760]   - Yeah.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.480]   - Okay, you picked up the guitar when you were 14.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.000]   Let's go back.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.480]   And one interesting thing that just jumped out at me
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.560]   is you said you learned how to practice in your head
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.640]   because you only had 30 minutes.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.920]   Your parents would only let you practice for 30 minutes.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.360]   I read somewhere that Coltrane did the same.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   He was not the practice part,
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.720]   but he was able to play instruments in his head
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.320]   as a way to think through different lines,
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   different musical thoughts, that kind of stuff.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   I just, maybe, can you tell the story of that?
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.120]   - Yeah, I just grew up in a environment
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.840]   that was focused on academia.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.920]   And I fell in love with guitar
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.360]   and really just wanted the focus to be that.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.400]   So my limit was 30 minutes a day for,
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.920]   I don't even remember how many times a week.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.520]   Might've been every day or five days a week, whatever.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.600]   - So your parents didn't want you to play more than that?
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.720]   - No.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.880]   And so I just learned how to visualize
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.040]   the fretboard in my head,
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.800]   and I'd practice all day in my head.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.280]   It's kind of like, you know,
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.920]   the "Queen's Gambit," the TV show with Anya Taylor-Joy,
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.760]   and she just like- - On the ceiling.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.600]   - Sits it on the ceiling.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.680]   I used to do that with the fretboard.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.040]   Yeah, just practice.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.840]   And I actually recommend it to every musician
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.560]   because if you're just practicing here,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.800]   you don't know what is more dominant necessarily.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.720]   Is it this or is it your motor skills?
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.960]   If you just take that away and do it here,
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.720]   you know you've got it.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.760]   So I'm glad that that happened
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.040]   and that I learned how to do that.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.640]   And in terms of learning fast,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.720]   'cause I had to learn how to,
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.120]   well, I had to try to absorb a lot of information
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.480]   in a short amount of time when I did have the instrument,
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   I kind of would do things in bursts,
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.640]   like even in that half an hour,
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.600]   I would just play for a couple minutes
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   and then I'd stop for like a minute.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.280]   And then I'd do it again,
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.680]   and I noticed there was a huge difference
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.880]   between the first time and the second time,
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.960]   whereas if I just kept repeating stuff,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.120]   it would be much slower.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.480]   - Well, what did you do in that minute?
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.320]   - Just hang out.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.560]   - Just integrate?
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.120]   - Yeah, it's like my brain was telling me,
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.160]   like, just chill out for a sec,
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.160]   that's enough information,
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.920]   let me take a second to integrate that.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.320]   That's at least what it felt like to me.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.680]   And the most hilarious thing happened a couple months ago.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.840]   I know you're friends with Andrew Huberman.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.400]   So he put out some clip,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.800]   which was a part of one of his podcasts about learning.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.600]   And he said that there was some research done
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.640]   on learning fast,
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.040]   and that if you practice something
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.480]   for a minute or so,
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   and then you let your brain rest for 30 seconds or a minute,
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.440]   that in that 30 seconds or a minute,
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.160]   your brain does the repetition 20 to 30 times faster
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.520]   and in reverse.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.600]   And I was like, whoa, that's so cool,
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.640]   'cause that's what I used to do when I was a kid.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.760]   Now there's science that proves that,
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.960]   which is really cool for musicians to know
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.440]   that that's a good way to practice efficiently.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.920]   'Cause you know, like some musicians,
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.240]   they're like practicing for six, seven, eight hours a day.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.200]   I've never done that.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.760]   I've never practiced more than an hour a day, even now.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   Like I've just, just that's my technique and it works.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.360]   - Are you also practicing in your head sometimes?
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.680]   - Now I'm not practicing as much.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.880]   I'm more always writing songs in my head.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.680]   So that's why I like silence.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.240]   That's why I love being in the empty hotel room
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.120]   and being alone or, you know,
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.960]   songs come to me while I'm showering
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.160]   or walking around doing the dishes.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.280]   Or occasionally when I'm hanging out with friends
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.000]   or like comedians and people just like say shit
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.880]   and I'll be like, that's a cool line.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.280]   I'm just like jotting down my phone.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.560]   - So it's not always musical, it's sometimes lyrical.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.600]   - It's more lyrical than musical now.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.560]   Because it's like, for me, it's like,
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.160]   well, there's so much music in the world.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.240]   If I'm going to write a song,
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.800]   I want the song to be about something interesting.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:07.040]   And so, yeah, the words matter to me.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.160]   - Yeah, and the right work and it has so much power.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.000]   It's crazy.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.560]   Like we said, with Leonard Cohen.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   And then they're often simple.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.960]   The really powerful ones are simple.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.520]   - And like when you mentioned Hallelujah,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.880]   you know, he wrote like 80 verses to Hallelujah
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   before he narrowed it down to like four.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   And it took him like 15, 20 years to write that song.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.520]   So some writers will do that.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.480]   And then other writers just vomit it out
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.880]   and it's beautiful.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.920]   Like I've heard that Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell,
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.440]   they're like, they're fast writers.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.840]   They just kind of comes out.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.800]   - That makes me feel so good to know Leonard Cohen
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.320]   wrote so many verses of that.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   Like that was so deliberately crafted,
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.720]   extensively, rigorously crafted.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.280]   He just would spend months and years
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.240]   and constantly refining, refining.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.360]   - Do you have songs like that for yourself?
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.880]   Or you refine for many years?
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.040]   - It's song dependent.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.400]   Some just flow out and it's like, oh, there it is.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.240]   Everything's there.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.240]   And then other songs, it's like,
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.520]   you might have started it with music
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.280]   and there's some words that come out
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.280]   and then trying to fill in the rest of the words.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.720]   Sometimes it can be like a square peg in a round hole.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.760]   And other times it's like, oh no, I can,
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.960]   you know, it depends.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.640]   Sometimes it becomes like a math problem
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.680]   and hopefully it doesn't.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.880]   'Cause you just want to say what's right for the song.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.720]   And usually when you, you know, write it all together,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:42.560]   like the lyric and the melody and the chords
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.240]   and everything's kind of developing at once,
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.360]   at least for the first draft, that's very, very helpful.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.000]   Like Sondheim used to write like that.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.440]   Just like, he wouldn't move on
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.880]   until like he would just go this way.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.840]   Whereas for me, it's just like,
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.360]   I'll just go with what seems to be coming naturally
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.760]   and I'll just let it be what it is.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.200]   And then you come back and you say, okay,
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.400]   well, what do I have to do to this now?
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.920]   Well, like what's needed?
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.160]   - Just to linger on the learning process.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.880]   What would you recommend for young musicians
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.200]   and how to get good?
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.640]   What are the different paths a person can take?
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.200]   To understand it deeply enough to create something special.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.360]   - I think first and foremost,
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.120]   understanding why you are playing music.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.920]   If it's 'cause you have something
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.080]   that you're trying to express
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.800]   or that you're just in love with expression itself,
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.800]   with art itself.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.800]   Those are great reasons to start this journey.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.360]   - The why should be.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.080]   - I think the why is really important
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:55.960]   'cause it's a jagged lifestyle and there's a lot in it.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.880]   And so if you don't have your purpose,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.360]   if you're not centered in your purpose,
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.400]   then all that jagged lifestyle
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.160]   is probably gonna get to you.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.000]   - Jagged?
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.080]   - It's jagged.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.160]   Yeah, it's jagged.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.320]   It's all over the place.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.760]   It's uncertain.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.520]   It's one thing, one moment
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.160]   and a completely different thing, another moment.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.640]   You never know what's gonna happen.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:22.000]   And if you thrive on variety, which I love variety,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.240]   then it's perfect.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.800]   But also every human being needs
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.840]   a certain amount of certainty and structure.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.720]   And so the certainty can come from your inner knowing,
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.480]   knowing that you're doing exactly what you want to be doing
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.800]   and knowing what your purpose is in doing it,
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.760]   in this expression.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.840]   Otherwise you're just kind of like
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.360]   a leaf blowing in the wind.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.720]   - Like in the early days, touring,
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.600]   just playing clubs seems like tough.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.600]   - Yeah.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.440]   - It's a lot.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.800]   - Yeah, it's a lot of like the physical labor aspect
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.200]   of it is really hard.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.360]   Playing on stage to two people or 2000 or 20,000,
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.560]   that doesn't make a difference.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.440]   I mean, it makes a difference to the ticket sales,
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.320]   which informs what level of luxury
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.760]   you might have on the road or not.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.640]   But other than that,
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.960]   it's just people there listening to music.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.040]   The music doesn't change.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.880]   - Does it make it tough when it's two people versus 200?
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.960]   - No.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.920]   - So even if nobody recognizes
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.480]   whatever the thing you're doing?
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.000]   - No, because the idea is to be doing,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.520]   like having a great conversation on stage.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.440]   - The audience can come and go.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.600]   - Yeah.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.440]   I mean, I always like,
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.400]   like there's certain points in shows where I'm just like,
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.200]   I consciously am like,
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.440]   oh, yes, there's an audience over there.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.760]   'Cause I'm so like wrapped up
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.240]   in whatever's happening on stage.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.760]   - You forget yourself.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.840]   - Or maybe I'm remembering myself.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.160]   - Oh, damn.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.520]   Callback somehow feels like one.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.640]   Okay, you think every instrument is its own journey?
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.480]   Is it play guitar, you play bass, you sing?
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.520]   Just the mastery of an instrument,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.400]   or let's avoid the word mastery,
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.240]   the understanding of an instrument is its own thing?
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.520]   Or are they somehow like
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.360]   physical manifestations of the same thing?
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   - Both.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.200]   Like every instrument has its strengths,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.440]   beauty, limitations, range, like possible range
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.880]   that can be extended to some degree or another,
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.440]   depending on who you are.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.880]   Like trumpet or something, you know?
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.000]   Like certain people can hit higher notes than others,
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.040]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:45.040]   But that being said, we're all playing the same 12 or 24,
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:49.520]   however you divide the octave, that many notes,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.640]   you know, we're all playing the same notes.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.000]   So in that sense, it's all the same thing.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   It's just music or better yet, it's just art or expression.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.800]   But yeah, every instrument has, you know,
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.160]   you gotta go through the physical aspects
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.080]   of it, the motor skills and all of that.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.120]   And hopefully you get through that really quickly
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.280]   so you can get to the expression quickly.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.440]   'Cause if you get stuck in just that first phase,
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.320]   that's be really boring.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.280]   - Yeah, but that's a pretty long phase,
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   the technical skill required to really play an instrument.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.680]   - For some people, it's a long thing
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.360]   and some people it's short.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.440]   It very much varies.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.920]   It might have to do with like how you learn
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.960]   and getting to know like your strengths in learning,
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.240]   like more oral or more like, is it more like,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.160]   like what's your strength and playing off of those strengths.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.280]   So for me, like I was saying earlier,
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.360]   it was just an intuitive thing that I knew,
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.440]   I can feel when my brain is full,
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.080]   like that it needs processing time.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.000]   And so I listened to that, I don't push past it.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.320]   Even if it's like one minute and I do something,
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.440]   I'm like, okay, silence.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.720]   And then I come back and I trust
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.280]   that it's gonna be there and is there.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.040]   So just trusting yourself, I think is really important.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.000]   Trusting that you know you better
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.760]   than anybody else is gonna know you.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.880]   So that's the kind of thing with teachers
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.760]   that can be either really, really helpful and great
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.720]   or really not great.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.560]   Like I'm primarily self-taught.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.120]   I've had amazing mentors of all walks of life.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.440]   And I think I'm unbelievably blessed
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.800]   that my mentors are some of my favorite musicians on earth,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.400]   whether it's Leonard Cohen or Jeff Beck or Wayne Shorter,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.800]   whoever these people are, like they are my favorite
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.000]   musicians.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.040]   So not everyone has that opportunity,
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.520]   but what the opportunity that we have now
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.680]   that I didn't have when I was starting
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.960]   is that everything's on YouTube.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.720]   Like every interview with every genius,
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.200]   like you don't need to necessarily have these people
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.440]   in person now.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   I mean, and then I'll say to that, yes and no.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.120]   I agree with myself and then I don't agree with myself.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.360]   And the reason is I do believe that there is something
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.000]   that happens when you're in person with a master.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.320]   In some cases that there is something transferred
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.240]   that is not intellectual, it's not spoken,
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.040]   it's something else that happens, that can happen,
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.520]   that I've experienced.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.720]   And I really value that.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.800]   - And I think that applies to specific disciplines
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.760]   and also generally.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.680]   Like I've been around Olympic gold medalists
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.040]   just to hang out with them for several days.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.520]   And there's something about greatness.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.200]   There's a way about them that kind of permeates
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.120]   the space around them.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.960]   You kind of learn something from it.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.760]   Even if you don't practice that particular discipline,
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.600]   there's something to it.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.160]   If you're able to see it.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.480]   I also like what you said about the playing stuff
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   in your head, that it forces you to not be,
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   to not be lost in the physical learning of the instrument.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.880]   I think that's one of the things I probably regret
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.720]   a little bit.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.160]   So I play both piano and guitar and I've become quite,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.680]   over the years, technically proficient at the instruments.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.260]   But I think my mind is underdeveloped because of that.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.220]   Meaning like I can't really,
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.220]   I can feel the music when it's created,
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:04:00.340]   but I can't create out of the feeling.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.540]   I haven't practiced the,
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.260]   projecting the feeling onto the music.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.900]   And I'm not like a musician, but I'm just,
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.980]   it's a different muscle that I think is,
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.580]   if you really want to create beautiful things,
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.060]   you have to, the creation happens here, not here.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.180]   - I think it's more here.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.340]   Or whatever, it's some part of the body,
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.620]   but it's not with your fingers.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.140]   - Yeah, 'cause I think the fingers is more this.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:24.980]   - Sure.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.860]   - And then.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.220]   - Yes, it is here.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.060]   - Yeah.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.380]   - And it's just nice that you said that,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.460]   'cause it's probably really,
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.340]   it's really good advice if you want to create.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:38.500]   - Yeah, slowing down is really great too.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.580]   - What do you mean slowing down?
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.120]   - Slowing everything down.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.980]   It could be, I can play something really fast,
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:51.700]   but I may want to like practice it.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:05:03.700]   Like.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.100]   (soft music)
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:11.180]   - Go slow as possible.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:16.780]   - 'Cause there's all these micro movements
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:21.020]   and that are happening that if you just go.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:25.140]   Like you can't pay as close attention
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.460]   to the exact tone that you're pulling from each note.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.420]   And there's a lot to pay attention to
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.020]   to how my fingers are touching the string here.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.300]   Like I can change my tone a million ways
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.080]   just by the direction of this finger.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.060]   And same with how this lands
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.460]   and how hard I'm attacking the string.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.860]   And with what intention am I hitting the string?
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.900]   Emotionally, physically.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.820]   And so even if you can go.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.900]   Play that so slow.
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.780]   See how locked into a pocket you can be.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.780]   See how you like feel every aspect of that.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.620]   'Cause then when it gets sped up,
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.260]   it's still there with you.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.100]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:08.920]   - That's brilliant.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.380]   - It's kind of like the transcended and included thing
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.220]   that Ken Wilber talks about.
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.660]   It's like.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.500]   - And I guess that's what meditation can do for you
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.860]   is to like really listen to,
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.460]   like observe every aspect of your body,
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:20.900]   the breath and all this.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.780]   Here you're observing every element,
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.460]   like every super detailed element of playing a single note.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.540]   - Yeah.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.780]   - That's cool that if you speed it up,
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.040]   it's still there with you.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:30.940]   - It is.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.840]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.700]   'Cause I hear, there are certain people
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.140]   it's like they play really fast,
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:42.140]   but I don't hear the fullness of tone always.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.540]   And it's like, well, it's probably 'cause maybe they didn't,
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.320]   maybe it's 'cause they didn't slow it down
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.260]   and really sit with each note
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.700]   and let it like resonate through their whole being.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.660]   It's spiritual.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.020]   It's like a spiritual expression.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:01.060]   It's not just like, you know, it's not a sport.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.940]   A lot of people treat music like a sport.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.820]   - Yeah.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.140]   Since starting to learn more like Stevie Ray Vaughan
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.400]   versus Jimi Hendrix,
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.420]   I would spend quite a long time on single notes,
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:14.140]   so just bending, just like,
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:17.580]   just listening to what you can do with bends, spending.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:21.140]   Just thinking like people like BB King
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.340]   and all these blues musicians,
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:26.700]   like spend a career just making a single note cry.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:27.540]   - Yeah.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.780]   - There's like an art form to that.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.620]   - Yeah.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.980]   - And I think you putting it, like taking it really slow,
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.540]   which I never really thought of,
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.020]   is a really good idea.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.500]   Like really slow it down.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.580]   - It's the same with like sitting with your own emotions.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:47.560]   It's like we, when emotions are overwhelming to us,
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.180]   we get real busy or we move real fast
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:53.460]   'cause it's like we don't wanna feel our feelings.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.940]   And those are the moments to slow yourself down.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.180]   - And observe it.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.380]   Anger, jealousy.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.220]   - And just be with it.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.260]   Yeah, just be with it.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.100]   Be like, be cool with it.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.000]   Like love it.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.500]   Love the anger.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.600]   - It's all beautiful.
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.420]   (laughing)
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.060]   - Can you educate me on the difference between bass?
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.140]   - Bass and bass?
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.780]   Okay, well, one is a fish.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.780]   - At least I pronounced it correctly.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.620]   That's good.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.820]   It's all about the bass.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.540]   - Can you pronounce my name?
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.620]   - Tal.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:24.460]   - Wow.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.940]   Most people say Tal.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.780]   - Tal.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.780]   - Or Tal.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.420]   - Tal, who says Tal?
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.620]   - Like so many people.
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.060]   - In the South maybe, Tal.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.580]   - I don't know, but the fact that you said my name,
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.780]   you get extra points.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.580]   - Wow, I didn't know this was a game.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.420]   Am I winning?
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.260]   - Yep.
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.080]   - I like winning.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.740]   How do you play the bass?
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:48.340]   What's the difference between fingerstyle and slap?
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.900]   - Slap is like this, fingerstyle is like this.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:52.580]   - You ever played bass with a pick?
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.100]   - Yeah, sometimes.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.460]   - I'm not accusing you of anything.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.460]   - No accusation taken.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.460]   - I don't know if these are sensitive topics.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.620]   - That would be pretty hilarious
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.660]   if I was sensitive about bass techniques,
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.780]   but not about love.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.700]   - It just looks so cool to slap it.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.420]   And I don't understand what that's about.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   Like that thumb thing that.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:16.420]   - Yeah, I slap less, a lot less, almost never actually.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.820]   It has a very distinctive sound
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.540]   and does a very distinctive thing to a song
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:28.540]   that is not something I hear needed very often
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.740]   in music today.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.020]   - Yeah.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:37.020]   - But in certain styles, like funk, it sounds awesome
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.260]   and it makes sense.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.060]   It was something that was a bit overused at one point.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.020]   For instance, like my mentor, Anthony Jackson,
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.780]   he refused to slap.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   Like he actually said, "If you want me to slap,
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.300]   "I'll leave this gig."
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.340]   So I'm not like that.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.500]   - See, that's why I said sensitive.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.020]   See, I was like reading into it.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.460]   - 'Cause he's sensitive about it.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.260]   - I was feeling the spiritual energy
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.820]   of the sensitivity of the topic, Anthony Jackson.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.740]   And then, I mean, I'm playing electric bass.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.940]   So generally speaking, you don't particularly
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:13.260]   wanna hear electric bass on straight ahead jazz anyway.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.100]   You wanna hear an upright bass.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.740]   But if I was to play jazz on electric bass,
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:23.140]   I might even kind of like palm mute.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.340]   You know, like instead of going like,
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.140]   I might go to very.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:33.500]   Anything to kind of make the notes,
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.940]   shorter and less resonant and like kind of fade away quick.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.860]   'Cause the upright does that naturally.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.340]   And I have like a different bass,
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.900]   like a hollow body harmony that sounds closer
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.580]   to an upright that I'll use.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.780]   And so like on my song "Under the Sun" that I put out,
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.060]   that was on a harmony bass.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.940]   And it has like kind of an upright acoustic
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.420]   kind of tone to it, but with more sustain.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:02.860]   - And is jazz fusion the style where you have like,
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.940]   oh, an electric bass?
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.020]   Can you educate me what's the jazz fusion?
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.060]   - Again, you can have both.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.460]   You can have both on, you can have either on anything.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:14.060]   There's no like real rules now.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.300]   - I've heard you say something interesting,
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.820]   which is, well, a lot of things you say is interesting.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.180]   - Just one thing.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.020]   - Just one.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:25.180]   - And it's what time you're leaving.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.980]   (both laughing)
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.020]   - What time was that again?
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.860]   - Three minutes.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.220]   - That it's maybe easier sometimes to define
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.420]   a musical genre by the don'ts than the do's.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.300]   The don'ts than the do's.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.740]   What are the don'ts of jazz and rock?
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.260]   What are the don'ts of jazz fusion?
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.700]   What are the don'ts?
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.180]   In any domain of life, what are the don'ts?
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:54.860]   - The don'ts is just to please leave your fear at the door.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:59.020]   And your do's is to be open to anything.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.460]   And open your ears, like respond to what's happening now.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.380]   I think that quote you're talking about
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.100]   might have been more about
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.260]   an individual musician's unique sound.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.540]   Because everyone has their sound.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.500]   If they've developed their voice
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.100]   and they've listened to their own aesthetic preferences,
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.620]   of which everyone is slightly different,
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.180]   everyone has slightly different likes and dislikes.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.140]   Then you'll have a unique sound on your instrument
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.420]   and your unique sound is defined
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.300]   more by the choices you make rather than,
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:41.940]   I mean, it's equally as defined by the choices you make
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.780]   and the choices you don't make.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.660]   I mean, it's the flip side of the same coin, really.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.980]   - Yeah, there's certain musicians you can just tell.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.820]   It's them, just you hear a few notes
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.140]   and you're like, okay, it's them.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.180]   Tone, sometimes it's tone,
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.860]   sometimes it's the way they play rhythm.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.940]   - Yeah, that quote you're talking about
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:02.020]   might have even had to do with someone's real limitations
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.300]   on an instrument, that then that would define their sound
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.340]   as the things that they can't, like actually can't do,
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.780]   versus what you're choosing to do
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.540]   versus not choosing to do,
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.860]   which is that flip side of the same coin thing.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.500]   - How many fingers you play with.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.220]   It seems like a lot of the greatest musicians
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.260]   aren't technically perfect.
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:26.540]   The imperfections is the thing that makes them unique.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.900]   And where a lot of the creativity comes from.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.020]   I mean, Hendrix, Hendrix had a lot of those things.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.300]   The way he put like a thumb over the top.
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.620]   - Well, his hands were huge.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:38.060]   There was no other place for the thumb to go.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.620]   And it was great that he could reach the E string
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.900]   and that was an advantage.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.740]   - And he was a lefty playing a right and a guitar.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.780]   Flipped, I guess.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.380]   That's weird.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.420]   That probably doesn't have much of an effect,
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   maybe a spiritual one, I don't know.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.700]   - Actually flipping a guitar is different.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.020]   It does bring out something different in you.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.260]   'Cause I've done it, I've flipped it,
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.060]   and it's like, oh wow, yeah, it's really different.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.940]   I remember talking to my osteopath about,
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.780]   'cause there's so much weight on this shoulder
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.020]   while I'm playing all the time.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.340]   And they were saying, well, just after shows,
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.100]   just literally just turn it upside down
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.780]   and do the exact same thing in the opposite way.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.180]   It'll even out your body.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.300]   And I was like, that's good advice.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.740]   - Have you actually tried it?
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:26.780]   Okay, all right.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.940]   I'll write that down.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:36.060]   All right, well, do you know a guy named Davey504?
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.220]   - I've heard of him.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.740]   - I recently learned of him.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.980]   He's a YouTuber and a bass player.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.220]   He's amazing.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.540]   He combines memes and also just
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.820]   these brilliant bass compositions.
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.940]   And says slap like a lot.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.980]   He's big into slapping.
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.180]   He's the one that kinda made me realize this is a thing.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.660]   - Okay, and he also said that you're one of the best,
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.700]   not the best bassists in the world.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.660]   There was a bunch of his fans that wrote in
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.300]   and he analyzed the Jeff Peck thing
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.500]   that we watched at Crossroads.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.140]   It was one of the greatest solos ever, bass solos ever.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.900]   So shout out to him.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.140]   What does that make you feel like?
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.100]   You're the greatest of all time.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.300]   - Chocolate cookies.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.940]   - Chocolate, is that your favorite?
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.460]   - I like macadamia nut,
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.740]   like if you really wanna get into it
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.420]   with like white chocolate.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.580]   - Yeah, that's a rare one for people to say
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.420]   is the favorite.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.540]   - Chocolate chip is just so easy.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.220]   You can kinda get them anywhere.
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:29.820]   - Yeah, last thing you wanna be is easy.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.620]   This world, you don't wanna be easy.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.020]   You said that I love rock and roll, quote,
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.980]   I love folk, I love jazz, I love Indian classical music.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.180]   I really love all kinds of music
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.140]   as long as it's authentic and from the heart.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.660]   So when you play rock versus jazz,
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:44.460]   you played all kinds of music.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.740]   What's the difference technically,
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.020]   musically, spiritually for you?
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.460]   - Well, there's no spiritual difference.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.820]   - Okay, nice.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.020]   Cross that off the list.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:58.100]   - But, well, musically, yeah,
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.860]   it's kinda like what we were saying earlier.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.860]   It's like each genre has its language
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.380]   of what makes it that genre.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:12.500]   And that would be a good thing to say
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.700]   it's defined by the do's and don'ts.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:21.620]   Because, yeah, it's like, I'm trying to think,
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.140]   basically I put the song first
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:29.140]   and I think of the song as the melody,
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:32.140]   the lyrics, and then the harmony,
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.420]   and obviously the groove.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.820]   - So the song goes before the genre in a sense.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.660]   Each song is like its own thing.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.260]   - They're both things that are held in my mind.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.060]   It's like, okay, genre and then song,
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.540]   which is comprised of those basic elements.
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.740]   And I tend to kind of prioritize lyric
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:59.500]   because somebody is trying to express something over music.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.140]   And so the lyric is very, very important.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:07.220]   And so then the choices come from there.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.980]   It's like, okay, within the genre of X,
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:15.340]   this is the typical language.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:19.540]   And then how do I best serve this lyric?
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:23.580]   And then where else can I pull from
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:27.220]   that might not be in these two bags
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:30.180]   that would put a little twist on it?
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.580]   So those are all the kinds of things
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.300]   I might be thinking about.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.460]   But I don't like twists for the sake of twists either.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:43.460]   I like twists because I wanna hear something
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.020]   that might be fresh.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:50.300]   But when someone does something just to be hip,
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.100]   it's annoying to me.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.940]   I think you can hear the difference.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.260]   It's like when people, they write in odd time signatures
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:02.620]   or they write all these riffs just because they can,
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.140]   just 'cause they have the chops to do it
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:08.340]   or they know how to play in 11/16 and whatever.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:14.060]   But if it's not actually creating a piece of music
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.740]   that's going to move somebody, then why are you doing it?
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:20.980]   And so I think a lot of the questions I'm asking myself
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.980]   when I'm approaching a song
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.220]   are mainly philosophical and aesthetic.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.260]   - So you like to stand on the edge of the cliff,
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:30.260]   not for the thrill of it,
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.220]   but 'cause that's where you find something new, potentially.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:36.220]   - Yeah, and it's thrilling.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.860]   - But you're not doing it just for the thrill.
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.140]   - I'm not doing it for the thrill.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.220]   It just happens to be thrilling.
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.340]   - All right.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.340]   - 'Cause you can always reel it back in.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.220]   - Can you though?
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.380]   - Yeah, you can.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.980]   You can do a totally disciplined,
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.580]   like I can go into a session and, okay.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.660]   My favorite thing about going into a session
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:00.660]   with musicians that I adore is that we don't hear the demo.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.740]   'Cause if you hear a demo,
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.660]   you're hearing what the producer or songwriter
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.540]   have already imagined that every instrument is playing.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.180]   And then it's like, well, I've already heard what you want.
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:13.380]   Now my mind is, part of my mind is focused
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:14.220]   on what I already know you want
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.180]   and what the destination is gonna be.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.140]   Why did you bring me in here?
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.900]   I wanna not hear it.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.540]   I just want you to sit at a piano and sing the song.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.220]   I wanna hear the chords and the lyric
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.540]   and sit in an acoustic guitar, play it,
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.940]   and then let's all go in the room and then take one.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:35.620]   I would say 80% of the time, take one has the most gold.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.380]   And there might be like a mistake or two
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.540]   or someone forgot to go to the B section.
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.500]   And you might wanna like punch that in
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.300]   so that you're hitting the right chord.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.660]   But all the magic is in that take.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.580]   And then sometimes it happens where it's like you go,
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.660]   let's say we're rehearsing and take one, two, three, four,
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.980]   and then you're like thinking about it too much.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.380]   And then you go and you have a dinner and you come back
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:01.780]   and the next take one after dinner is the one.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:05.620]   Like it's usually after there's some sort of a break.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:08.540]   But obviously there's exceptions to that rule.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.180]   Sometimes it's take two, three.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.740]   - Yeah, you said that this is something
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:15.500]   that surprised you about recording with Prince
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.660]   is that he would just, so much of it would be take one.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.700]   So quick, it would just move so quickly.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.620]   - Yeah, well, with that particular album
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.860]   that we made together, it's called "Welcome to America."
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.420]   He called me up and asked me,
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:30.900]   he said, "I wanna make a band with you.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:33.060]   I'm like really inspired by what you're doing
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.140]   with Jeff Beck.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.700]   I wanna make a trio.
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.020]   Do you like the drum rolls of Jack DeJohnette?"
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.340]   It was like his first question to me.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.660]   I'm like, "Well, yeah, who doesn't?
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.140]   Who doesn't like Jack DeJohnette?"
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.140]   Like one of the greatest of all time.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:47.260]   And he's like, "Well, you know, sounds like,"
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.860]   'cause we had a discussion about drumming,
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.300]   "sounds like you're kind of particular about drummers.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.860]   So why don't you find us the drummer
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.220]   and I'll trust you to find the drummer.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.820]   You can audition some people, send me some recordings
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:20:59.860]   and maybe your two favorites
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:02.540]   and I'll pick out of the two or something."
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.900]   So I did that, went on a journey,
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:07.660]   found a couple of guys, he picked the one.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:12.660]   We went in and he basically just would be like,
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.100]   "Okay, so the A section is gonna go like this.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.500]   And then the B section, I think we're gonna go to G
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.380]   and da, da, and then the bridge.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:25.140]   I might go to B flat, but maybe I'll hold off and da, da, da.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.060]   Okay, let's go.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.100]   One, two, three, four."
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.540]   And then we recorded it to tape.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.380]   There was no part, he did not want me to punch anything.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.860]   Like it was like, and there was one song called
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.940]   "Same Page, Different Book."
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.220]   And he like talked through it just like he did.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.900]   And then he had me soloing between each phrase,
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.020]   like little fills.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.380]   It was like, I didn't know that that was gonna come up.
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.540]   And he loved that.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.540]   He loved to have me on the edge of my seat,
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.100]   like falling off the cliff.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.820]   That was my first like real, like falling off a cliff moment
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:04.300]   from somebody else holding me at the edge of the cliff.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.340]   You know what I mean?
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:10.300]   Now I just do it on my own 'cause it's so fun
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.620]   and it makes sense.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.260]   It's the best thing for the music.
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.340]   - When you say punch the tape,
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.540]   is that when you actually record it?
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.980]   - Like if you record to tape and there's like,
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.940]   say like you hit a bum note,
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.940]   like to punch in means to like fix that note.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.340]   Like re-record over that one little area
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.220]   and punch that note in.
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.060]   He didn't want that.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.380]   He's like, "All my favorite records just like,
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.740]   whatever happened, happened.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.980]   That's that moment in time.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.140]   Let's make a new moment in time."
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:39.980]   It's great.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.700]   Nobody makes records like that anymore.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:45.420]   Everyone wants to like, you know, edit and edit
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.900]   and re-record and this and that.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.140]   And unfortunately with a lot of music,
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.140]   I'm not saying all music,
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.580]   'cause there's plenty of great music coming out,
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   but there's the danger of it being flat
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:03.700]   because every little imperfection is digitally removed.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.100]   - Well, that's one of the promising things about AI
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.940]   is because it can be so perfect
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:10.580]   that the thing will actually come back to
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:13.060]   and value about music is the imperfections
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.620]   that humans can create.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.460]   - Yeah.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.700]   - There'll be a greater valuation of imperfections.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.540]   - Yeah.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.460]   I mean, you can kind of program imperfections too.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.300]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.300]   That's also very sad.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.740]   But then you get closer and closer
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740]   to what it means to be human.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.580]   And maybe there'll be AIs among us.
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.620]   There'll be AIs among us.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.900]   There'll be human flawed like the rest of us.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:39.180]   Mortal and silly at times.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:43.980]   - Another big sigh.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:49.460]   - Is it fair to say that you're very melodic on bass?
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:54.460]   Like you make the bass sing more than people normally do?
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.500]   - Is that a compliment?
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.500]   - Yes, I think so.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.340]   - Thank you.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.100]   - Moving on to the next question.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:04.140]   - I mean, by way of understanding,
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.900]   it's just there's something about the way you play bass
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.580]   that just kind of pulls you in the way
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.140]   when you listen to somebody play a guitar,
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.300]   like a guitar solo.
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:15.220]   - The thing I love about Jeff Beck
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.580]   is that he played the guitar like a singer.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.900]   And I think that the way that Wayne Shorter
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.340]   played his saxophone, it's like a singer.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.780]   And I think everyone, every musician
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.060]   aspires to just sound like a singer.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.820]   - So you make it sing.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.060]   Let me ask you about, just come back to Hendrix,
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.980]   'cause you said that you had three CDs,
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.260]   Jimi Hendrix, Herbie Hancock, and Rage Against the Machine.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:39.860]   First of all, great combination.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.540]   I'm a big Rage fan.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.340]   - It's so funny 'cause like when I listen
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.380]   to some of the music that I create,
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.260]   like my solo music, I'm like,
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.100]   I could see how this is a combination
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:52.900]   of Herbie Hancock, Rage Against the Machine,
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:54.020]   and Jimi Hendrix.
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:58.260]   I hear the influences, it's funny.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.060]   - Just from your musician perspective,
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.540]   what's interesting to you about,
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.780]   what really stands out to you about Hendrix?
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.700]   I just would love to hear
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:12.500]   like a real professional musician's opinion of Hendrix.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:18.460]   - I love that he is two voices
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.380]   combined into one voice.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:23.860]   So it's like, there is his voice on the guitar,
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.980]   and there is his singing voice,
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:29.540]   and there is the combination of the two
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.540]   that make one voice.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:36.540]   And of course, the third element is his songwriting.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:40.780]   And all of this have this beautiful chemistry
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:45.380]   and all work geniusly, perfectly together.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.060]   And there's nothing like it.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.660]   And he always beat himself up about being a singer
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.940]   and like he didn't like his voice,
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.420]   but it's like, my favorite singers
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.740]   are the singers that don't sound like singers.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:25:59.580]   - Bob Dylan.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.420]   - Bob Dylan.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.460]   - You like Bob Dylan.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.140]   - Love Bob Dylan.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.380]   - You love his voice too.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.100]   - I love his voice.
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:09.860]   - Can you explain your love affair with Bob Dylan's voice?
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.020]   - He's expressing his lyrics.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:17.860]   It's just pure expression, exactly what he means.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:22.060]   I feel everything that he's saying
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.740]   with 100% authenticity.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.380]   That's what I wanna hear from a singer.
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.900]   I don't care how many runs you can do
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.420]   and blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.180]   I wanna believe what you're saying.
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:34.780]   - Leonard Cohen is that.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.420]   - There's countless like Neil Young.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.140]   I mean, there's so many musicians.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.340]   I love Elliot Smith for that reason.
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.620]   - Let me ask you about mentorship.
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:49.540]   You said teachers and mentors, you had mentors.
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:53.940]   What's a good mentor for you, harsh or supportive?
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.060]   - Supportive.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.100]   - Supportive.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.780]   You've seen "Whiplash," the movie?
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.220]   So that guy, somebody's screaming at you,
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.260]   like kicking you off the cliff.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.220]   - Not necessary.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.540]   I feel like anybody that's truly passionate
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.660]   about something that they wanna be great at
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:11.820]   or a master of or this and that,
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:14.900]   they've already got that person inside their own head.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.180]   You don't need somebody else to do that for you.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:24.180]   I think you need love, acceptance, guidance, support, time.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:30.180]   Advice if you ask for it, just a space,
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.820]   just a nice open space.
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:36.420]   All my mentors were just that for me.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.340]   They didn't tell me to do anything.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.340]   They didn't care.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.740]   'Cause they're not, why do they need to be invested
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.740]   in where I'm going?
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.580]   Only I know where I'm going.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.260]   So for some mentor to come and be like,
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:52.020]   this is what you need to be doing and practice this.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:52.860]   But why?
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.060]   What if that's not my path?
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.980]   That might be your path.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:00.180]   So I'm not really, again, otherwise it feels like a sport,
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.300]   like who can run the fastest race?
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.140]   And it's like, well, okay, well,
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:05.620]   I get that for that for sport.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.940]   Maybe it makes sense to have someone a bit more hardcore,
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:12.180]   but still, I would say athletes have the same mentality.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:15.060]   They've got that in them already too.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:18.180]   So I think more of a strategic approach
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.180]   to mentorship works really well.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:24.940]   And mainly just having an open space
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.460]   and just being available to someone.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.580]   - And kind of show that they see the special in you.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.820]   - And they give you the room to develop that special,
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.660]   whatever.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.780]   - Exactly, 'cause if you do have that harsh critic
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.380]   inside you, it's like, it is nice to have somebody
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.820]   that isn't like your family or someone
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.460]   that's not obligated in any way,
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.980]   that just sees your talent and they're like,
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:50.460]   yeah, I dig what you're doing, keep doing it.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:55.660]   - Yeah, it's funny that that's not always easy to come by.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.060]   - Do you have any mentors?
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.740]   - Yeah, I've had a few recently,
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.040]   but for most of my life, people didn't really,
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.700]   you know, I'm very much like that too.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.180]   Like somebody to pat me on the back and say like,
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.120]   like see that there's something in you of value.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.540]   Yeah, I didn't really have that, so.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.660]   - Do you wish you did?
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:21.180]   - Yeah, yeah, but maybe the wishing that I did
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.620]   is the thing that made me who I am, not having it.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:27.500]   The longing for that, maybe that's the thing
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:32.500]   that helped me develop a constant sense of longing,
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:38.820]   which I think is a way of, because I have that engine in me,
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:42.660]   it really allows me to deeply appreciate
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.220]   every single moment, every single,
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.720]   everything that's given to me.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.180]   So like just an eternal gratitude.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:52.140]   So you never know which are the bad parts
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.940]   and the good parts.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:57.080]   So if you remove one thing, it might be,
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.100]   the whole thing might collapse.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.260]   I suppose I'm grateful for the whole thing.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:08.700]   That one note you screwed up so many years ago,
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.140]   that might've been essential.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.140]   - What about, because you do jujitsu.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.780]   - Yes, do you?
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.860]   - Are you?
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.220]   - My dad does.
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:19.020]   My dad's super into it.
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.720]   I love my dad, he's the coolest.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.740]   But no, I don't do it.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.620]   He's a blue belt right now.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.740]   - Nice, nice.
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.300]   You ever been on the mat with him?
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.780]   - Not yet, but I plan on it.
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:33.620]   - You should do it.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:34.940]   - What belt are you?
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:35.780]   - Black belt.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.300]   - Sick.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:38.740]   Do you wanna go on the--
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:41.620]   - All right, you got the shit talking part of jujitsu done.
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.500]   You just have to do the technique.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.060]   - But for that, for instance,
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:52.060]   do you need a harsh mentor or a teacher?
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:56.260]   - Yeah, but you said it really beautifully.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:58.140]   There's a, to me, I agree,
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.640]   there's a difference between sport and art.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.540]   They overlap, for sure,
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.220]   but there's something about sport
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:09.060]   where perfection is actually,
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.180]   perfection, perfection is really the thing
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.680]   you really wanna get to.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.660]   The technical perfection.
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.660]   With art, it feels like technical perfection
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.660]   is almost a way to get lost on the path to wherever,
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:22.300]   something unique.
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:26.060]   But yeah, with sport, I definitely,
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.980]   and one of the kind of athletes
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.480]   that loves to have a dictatorial coach.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.260]   - Yeah.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:38.100]   - Somebody that helps me really push myself to the limit.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:40.380]   - But you're the one that's kind of dictating
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.340]   how hard you're getting pushed in a way.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:44.000]   You're choosing your mentor.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.920]   Like that "Whiplash" video is like,
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.960]   he didn't ask for that.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.040]   You know? - In a way, he might've.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.360]   - Well, maybe, maybe subconsciously.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.200]   - I mean, there is--
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.020]   - If it's a movie, so.
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:56.500]   (both laughing)
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.800]   - Next, you're gonna tell me they're just actors.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:02.840]   I mean, but yeah, how do we choose things?
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.880]   You don't always choose,
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.300]   but you kind of maybe subconsciously choose.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:11.120]   And some of it, like some of the great Olympic athletes
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.380]   I've interacted with, their parents for many years
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:16.260]   would force them to go to practice
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.180]   until they discovered the beauty of the thing
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.540]   that they were doing, and then they loved it.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:24.540]   So like, at which point does something
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.180]   that looks like abuse become like a gift?
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.220]   You know?
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.060]   It's weird.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:31.380]   It's all very weird.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:36.380]   But for you, support and space to discover the thing,
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:40.100]   the voice, the music within you.
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.280]   - Yeah, that's my personal choice,
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.460]   because I'm very familiar with the inner critic,
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:47.220]   and I can bring her out at any point.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:48.700]   I don't need help with that, you know?
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.860]   - Oh, so you do have, she's on call.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.840]   - She was on overdrive.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:57.680]   That's why now I'm, I had to work on that so much.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.460]   - Yeah, you have a really happy way about you right now.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.720]   - Thanks. - The very zen.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.040]   Can I ask you about Bruce Springsteen?
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:05.940]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.780]   - A lot of songs of his I listen to
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.060]   make me feel this melancholy feeling.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:15.160]   It's not just Bruce Springsteen, but Bruce does a lot.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:21.740]   What is that about songs that arouse a kind of sad feeling,
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.540]   or a longing feeling, or a feeling?
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.380]   What is that?
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:28.060]   What is that about us humans
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:29.760]   on the receiving end of the music?
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.060]   - Frequencies, each frequency does elicit
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:37.860]   a different kind of emotional response.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.340]   That is real, scientific.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:41.860]   - You mean like on the physics aspect of it?
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.700]   - Yeah, yeah, the physical level.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.540]   So there is that.
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:49.980]   Combined with the right kind of lyric
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.340]   and the right kind of melody of the right kind of chord
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:55.900]   will elicit a very particular kind of emotion.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.620]   And it is scientific, it can be analyzed.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.260]   I don't particularly want to analyze it
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:04.900]   because I don't want to approach things with that
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.460]   in advance, I don't want it to inform where I'm going.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.460]   I like the feeling to lead me naturally
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:14.080]   to where I'm writing.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.080]   But yeah, there's a real chemical element to that.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.780]   And then also, like I was saying,
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.920]   the lyric, what it means to you.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.420]   Which poetry is supposed to mean something
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.740]   to everybody, like different.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:31.760]   It's not supposed to mean one thing.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.900]   You can't analyze and be like,
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.220]   this is what this poet meant.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.860]   And like we were talking about with Leonard earlier,
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:42.860]   it's like the broader you can leave a lyric, the better.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:45.860]   You can appeal to people in so many different ways.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.620]   And even to the songwriter.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.300]   Like I'll sing some of my songs from five years ago
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.620]   and I'll be like, oh, I didn't even think
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.500]   that it could have meant that,
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.340]   but I guess it does, that's funny.
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:34:59.460]   I'll like just giggle on stage suddenly
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.260]   'cause a lyric will hit me differently
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.020]   from a different new experience or something.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.660]   - Have you ever cried listening to a song?
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.820]   - Of course.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:12.860]   Weep like a baby in a bathtub.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:17.540]   - Which, who's a regular go-to then?
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.300]   - Leonard. - Leonard, yeah.
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:23.140]   Hallelujah is a song that consistently
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.140]   makes me feel something.
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.280]   - It's holy, his work is holy.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.920]   And if you were in his presence,
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:37.700]   I guess there was a lot to that being.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:43.660]   - What advice would you give to young folks
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.260]   on how to have a life they can be proud of?
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:51.260]   - Just tackle the demons as early as possible,
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.860]   whether it's through your art or through meditation
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.860]   or through whatever it means, diaries, whatever it is.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:04.660]   Just walk towards the things that are scary.
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:10.340]   Because if you don't, they'll just expand,
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.300]   they become bigger.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.420]   If you avoid the demons, they become bigger.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:17.740]   - What does that mean for you today?
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.780]   Are you still missing Jeff?
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:21.200]   - I'll always miss Jeff,
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.620]   but I don't feel like a piece of me is missing.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:33.660]   And same with Leonard, it's that I did give them
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:37.620]   a piece of myself and maybe they gave me a piece of them
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:41.980]   that I hold with me and I cherish,
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:45.900]   but it doesn't feel like I'm less than
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.540]   or they're less than or anything's less than.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:53.540]   Just you learn to appreciate the impermanence
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:00.660]   of everything in life, the impermanence of everything
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:04.100]   except for consciousness, I guess you could say,
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.820]   is the only thing that is permanent.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:10.460]   So everything else, you learn to appreciate
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:15.060]   that impermanence because the limited amount of time
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:20.100]   in this particular body, it's enticing,
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.580]   kind of gives you a time limit, which is cool.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:24.420]   I like that.
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.300]   - So you've come to accept your own?
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.340]   - Yeah, it's cool that I'm like, okay,
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.780]   I've got maybe this amount of time, who knows.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.100]   - You could end today.
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:38.100]   - But if I died today, I'd be really happy with my life.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:41.420]   It's not like I'm like, oh, I missed out on this and that.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.820]   - So you really wanna make sure that every day
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.540]   could be your last day and you're happy with that.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:48.460]   - I've always lived that way.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:52.580]   Yeah, I felt this way since I was in my early 20s.
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:55.260]   I'd be like, yeah, I could die today, sure.
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.780]   I don't wanna die, I have no reason to die.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:02.260]   But if I did, I know that I put my everything,
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:05.340]   all my effort and all my passion and all my love
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.060]   into whatever I've already done.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.180]   So if my time's up, then my time's up.
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.940]   - What role does love play in this whole thing,
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.740]   in the human condition?
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.300]   - Well, love is everything.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.900]   I mean, if you define love, if you're talking about love
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:24.220]   as in romantic love or paternal or maternal love,
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:27.460]   or if you're talking about love as in,
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:30.940]   you know, in an Eastern tradition,
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:34.660]   like Vedanta, for instance, love is consciousness.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:36.460]   Love is everything.
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.380]   - That's the only permanent thing.
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:41.100]   - Yeah, or if you were to come from a Zen
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:44.780]   or like a Buddhist perspective, they would say nothingness,
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:49.780]   like emptiness is, versus fullness.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:51.180]   - Well, those guys are really obsessed
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.740]   with the whole suffering thing.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.540]   - And letting go of it.
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:56.380]   - Yeah.
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:03.980]   - Well, I was wondering if you would do me the honor
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:06.060]   of playing a song.
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:09.960]   - Do you want a suffering song or a suffering song?
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.060]   - I think I would love a suffering song.
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:13.900]   - Cool.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:19.660]   Do you want a sound check and make sure I'm not--
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.180]   (guitar strumming)
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.020]   - Sound check.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.700]   - One, two.
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:29.020]   Yeah, it sounds really good.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:30.540]   - This one's good?
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.580]   All right, count me off.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.420]   - Yeah.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:37.100]   I don't know how to count somebody off.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:37.940]   Where do I start?
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:41.820]   A nine or three, two, one.
