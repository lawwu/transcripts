[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this crazy time full of lockdowns uncertainty and
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.720]   Unemployment. I wanted to talk about the states with the highest and lowest unemployment benefits. It was a really eye-opening
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.000]   exercise for me to research and to understand how much states
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   provide or don't provide and this unemployment information by state will also
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.080]   Provide you with some information to make better decisions on whether to relocate for a job in a different state
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.640]   Because if you go to a state that has poor unemployment benefits, you might want to demand some higher benefits and a higher salary
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.800]   Now if you relocate to a state that has high unemployment benefits
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.040]   Well, you can be more flexible on your terms and you can also feel better
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.120]   About going to that state just in case you lose your job. Let's start off with some sad, but unfortunately realistic
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.920]   Unemployment numbers that could come out by the end of the summer 2020 or maybe by the end of the year frankly as
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.320]   Of May 2020 there are 30 million Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits now
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.160]   That's out of a hundred sixty million working population
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.320]   So that's almost a 20% unemployment rate now if we calculate
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.360]   3 million unemployment claims a week given the lockdowns will continue throughout May and maybe June hopefully not
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.840]   We're talking at least 40 million unemployed and if we talk about the jobs not fully coming back
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.500]   The numbers really could hover in the tens of millions
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.760]   Let's say 10 to 20 million by the end of the year even as the economy
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.560]   Rebounds and the lockdowns end. So these are huge huge numbers and thanks to the CARES Act
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.340]   It has increased unemployment benefits by $600 a week through
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.420]   July 31st 2020 and you will get unemployment benefits not the enhanced ones
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.880]   But just regular unemployment benefits through the end of the year December 31st 2020 now who knows what will happen on July 31st 2020
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.720]   Maybe the government will continue to enhance unemployment benefits of $600 a week if things are still pretty dire
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.260]   Because they did promise they're gonna do everything possible to ensure that the economy doesn't go under so who knows
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.240]   But on the flip side you actually don't want the government to provide these enhanced unemployment benefits for too long because that means the economy
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.480]   Is really down in the dumps. So let's look at the top 25 states with the highest unemployment benefits
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.840]   Unemployment benefits are basically paid out by the employer into an unemployment benefits fund and then the benefits are paid out by the state
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   For about 26 weeks is the average but some states only pay around 20 weeks
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.260]   But the average is about 26 weeks 25 26 weeks and then after 26 weeks the federal government kicks in
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.360]   Unemployment benefits are basically calculated by week and you can get your benefits usually every two weeks
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.580]   Maybe sometimes every once a week, but every two weeks is usually the norm and it takes
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.640]   Not on anywhere from two weeks to six weeks to first get your unemployment benefits
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.600]   Right now everything is backlogged so you can understand that sometimes you just can't even get through but you got to keep on trying
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   And don't worry
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   I think a lot of states will provide retroactive unemployment benefits and it's not like you're gonna miss out and get cut off
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   So let's start off with Massachusetts the number one highest state for unemployment benefits at eight hundred twenty three dollars a week
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.780]   So the normal monthly maximum if we use four weeks per month is three thousand two hundred ninety two dollars
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.160]   That's pretty good
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.840]   But remember you got to pay taxes on that and if you add in the cares act weekly bonus of six hundred dollars a week
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.040]   You could add two thousand four hundred dollars a month
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.360]   for a total weekly benefit of fourteen hundred twenty three dollars and a total monthly benefit of
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.480]   five thousand six hundred ninety two dollars
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.240]   So the top five states are all around five thousand and up and they are Massachusetts
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.680]   Washington, Minnesota, New Jersey and Connecticut
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.000]   Hawaii the total monthly benefit with the cares act is four thousand nine hundred ninety two and
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.240]   the worst of the top 25 states provides a benefit of
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.120]   4,276 with the cares act enhanced benefits that state is Nevada
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   Normally, they would provide monthly benefits of only eighteen hundred seventy six dollars, which is not great
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.960]   But it's not that bad. Now these numbers are per person
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.280]   So if you have a two working adult family household and these two individuals both lost their jobs
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.480]   Theoretically if you're in one of the top 25 states, you could get total monthly unemployment benefits with the cares act of between
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.080]   8,500 to
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.200]   $11,300 a month. I
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.920]   Would say that most of you maybe eighty ninety percent of you could live just fine off
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.600]   One person's unemployment benefits if you're just one person or family of four living off two people's unemployment benefits
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.400]   If they were making that much now
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.560]   Hopefully you have some savings to buttress that any shortfall if you need more
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.160]   But that is a pretty decent amount of money and we have to thank the government for being so aggressive and so proactive
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.280]   Also, we have to recognize there is a correlation between the amount of qualified income earned
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.380]   The unemployment benefit amount and the cost of living per state in other words higher cost of living states generally have higher unemployment benefits
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.680]   however
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.000]   Some states such as Minnesota, Oregon, North Dakota, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas and Ohio
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.400]   Seem to have more generous unemployment benefits than their cost of living would dictate for example
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.000]   The median household income in North Dakota is about sixty one thousand eight hundred dollars
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.480]   However, you now get maximum unemployment benefits of about fifty nine thousand three hundred dollars
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.760]   So that's pretty good. If I was a North Dakota and didn't have a job
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.000]   I would be honest. I would probably take those unemployment benefits until July 31st or
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.960]   Until I found the absolute absolute perfect job and that's really hard to do right now when things are locked up and there's so much
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.120]   Uncertainty and companies are having hiring freezes. What can you do but do the rational thing in my opinion the state?
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.840]   You want to best become unemployed is in Hawaii. Not only is Hawaii amazing place sunny warm
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   Lots of free outdoor activities. Hawaii also offers six hundred forty eight dollars a week in maximum unemployment benefits
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:09.960]   Due to the cares act the unemployed get twelve hundred forty eight dollars a week maximum or four thousand nine hundred ninety two dollars per month
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.040]   So even receiving the normal two thousand five hundred ninety two dollars a month and unemployment benefits is pretty good
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.080]   Think about what each state offers because it's important for where you want to work where you want to retire
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.280]   And where you want to kind of transition your life depending on what stage in your life you are in now
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.200]   Let's look at the states with the lowest unemployment benefits
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.480]   Although the amounts are much lower than the states with the highest unemployment benefits
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.120]   The benefit amounts are also correlated again with the cost of living per state
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:50.200]   So for example, Puerto Rico is the number one lowest quote state for unemployment benefits at a hundred ninety dollars a week maximum
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   So the normal monthly max is seven hundred sixty dollars
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.320]   But with the cares act not discriminating against anybody in any state of six hundred dollars a week
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.680]   The total monthly with cares act pay is three thousand one hundred sixty dollars
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:12.560]   Now if you think about that, that's pretty good because the median household income in Puerto Rico is roughly twenty thousand five hundred a year
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.360]   or
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   seventeen hundred eight dollars a month
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.720]   Therefore you can now earn
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.960]   Eighty-five percent more than the median household income through unemployment benefits
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:32.640]   So let's talk about the other top states with the lowest unemployment benefits. They are, Mississippi
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.360]   Arizona, Louisiana, Alabama
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.400]   Florida, Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, North Carolina
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.240]   Michigan, Georgia and so forth and if you want to see the full list
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:51.680]   You can just click over to the post in the show notes and you see two charts with the highest and lowest unemployment benefits by state
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   It's really interesting to see this list because I live in California and I thought getting four hundred fifty dollars a week was pretty good
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.720]   But guess what?
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.160]   Compared to everyone else four hundred fifty dollars a week in San Francisco is not very good at all
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.440]   So when you adjust for the cost of living
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.280]   unfortunately, I think California
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.000]   the District of Columbia and Arizona
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.640]   Provide the least amount of unemployment benefits for how expensive it is
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.940]   Now there's another category here states with highest unemployment benefits with dependents
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.280]   Ah, it actually changes if you have kids or not
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:35.840]   That's a pretty logical move by states and it shows which states are kind of on the ball and pro-family
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.560]   Let's look at the six states with special enhanced unemployment benefits for dependents Connecticut
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.080]   Weekly max normal is six hundred forty nine dollars. It goes up to seven hundred forty nine dollars with dependents
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.680]   Okay, hundred dollars more a week. Not bad, Illinois
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   kind of a disaster in terms of
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.000]   state budget and property taxes and so forth, but
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.800]   The weekly max normal is four hundred eighty four dollars and you got six hundred sixty seven dollars with dependents
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.320]   That's almost a two hundred dollar increase now, Massachusetts
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.560]   Number one state with the highest unemployment benefits at eight hundred twenty three dollars max normal a week
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.640]   It goes up to twelve hundred thirty four dollars with dependents. What a
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:29.720]   50% bump four hundred dollars more. I mean folks recognize recognize that if you find a job in Boston
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   Or somewhere in Massachusetts you want to start a family
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.000]   Massachusetts is number one if you ever get unemployed
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.880]   Ohio pretty darn good four hundred eighty dollars max normal a week with dependents. It goes up to six hundred forty seven
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.080]   Pennsylvania
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.560]   Not good
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:56.100]   $572 max normal weight goes up by eight bucks a week to 580 and then Rhode Island not bad, Rhode Island
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.240]   It is ranked one of the top states to buy real estate from a previous post
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.120]   The max normal week is five hundred eighty six dollars and it goes up to eight hundred
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.760]   sixty seven dollars with dependents
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   Now again, this is pre cares act
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.420]   So you add on the cares act enhanced unemployment benefits of six hundred dollars a week and then boom shakalaka
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.640]   You've got a pretty good
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.560]   Unemployment benefits amount there are now
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:30.200]   37 states that provide unemployment benefits that are at least the average
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.640]   Or up to 125 percent higher than the average wage
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:41.640]   So if you think about that rationally the people in these 37 states if they've lost their jobs should absolutely
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.780]   Apply for unemployment benefits you paid into it
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:52.980]   It's deserved and you should probably use it use it until the enhanced unemployment benefits runs out right now
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.480]   July 31st 2020 but it could be at an indefinite time
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.140]   Who knows and some will talk about you know moral reasons not to look again
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   you paid into it as part of your wage as an unemployment benefits insurance program per state and
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:15.100]   Life is tough right now. Life is full of lockdowns and uncertainty at the very least
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.720]   What you can do is get your finances order get some benefits after all those taxes
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.440]   You've paid for all those years and all the hard work you've given to your company who's laid you off
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.100]   There should be absolutely no shame in taking unemployment benefits
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.760]   So don't feel that shame and don't let anybody else shame you otherwise if you have not lost your job yet
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.980]   But you are thinking or you have been thinking about doing something new for a long time
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.780]   Now is probably the best time ever in a long time in at least
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:52.040]   10 years to try to engineer your layoff in order to get a severance package and the enhanced unemployment benefits
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.660]   Bosses right now are stressed out. They're being told by their bosses
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.040]   Okay, you've got to cut 10% of your team because we got to get through this or you got to furlough them
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.240]   Or you got to cut their wages by 20 to 50 percent. It is really really stressful to be a boss right now
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:13.460]   I've talked to CEOs my friends who are CEOs and other small business owners. They don't want to lay anybody off
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.500]   There's a lot of social pressure for not laying anybody off. That is just it's just tough, right?
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:25.260]   So if you can help ameliorate your bosses angst by saying hey, I'm willing to get laid off
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.180]   Do you think we can do some kind of severance package? I've been a good employee
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.660]   I've been here for three four or five ten years
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:37.900]   This is your opportunity. This is your opportunity to have that conversation because it is so
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:44.300]   Understandable right now. It's just not out of the blue. Hey, it's a bull market what you're doing good. Wait, what you want to leave?
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.060]   No, no, no, no right now. This is a reset
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.140]   This is beyond strange times
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.980]   Have the discussion to try to negotiate a severance if you've been wanting to leave for a while and who knows
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.100]   Let's say you get your severance you get your unemployment benefits
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.820]   You have time to breathe and relax and stand still for a while in this crazy competitive world
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:11.180]   You might find something you like to do that is different from work because all you've been thinking all these years is just work work
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:17.700]   Work clients, whatever getting these things done. You finally have time to think about other things time for yourself
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.700]   I really think you'll surprise yourself
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.580]   If you take a step back to think about your life to think about what you want to do
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.540]   I left in 2012. I was a little bit uncertain. Yes, I had financial samurai that I started in 2009
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:36.260]   But of course, I didn't know exactly for sure whether financial samurai is something that I wanted to do
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.580]   For the rest of my life, but here I am almost 11 years later, and I think
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:48.220]   It's a pretty good gig doesn't matter whether it does well or not. I just like to write I like to record
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.220]   I like to connect and I like to share some thoughts so that I can prevent people from
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:00.100]   Engaging in sub optimal financial behavior or avoiding landmines that I stepped on when I was in my younger days
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.220]   If I could rewind time to when I was 32 years old
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:10.380]   And if I was in a lockdown period at 32 years old, I would absolutely try to plant my flag on the internet
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:17.860]   The internet has shown its resiliency because hey look in a lockdown period you can shut off financial samurai
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.380]   You can't shut off these websites
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.020]   Now, of course if you have massive massive costs you might want to shut it down
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.060]   But for the most part running a website is really cheap and easy and free
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:33.620]   So I would try try something online because all online cannot be touched from offline activity
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.740]   And if you have enough investment income
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:41.100]   Well, maybe you can use this time as a test drive for early retirement
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.620]   It's kind of like early retirement, but it's not really because your liberties have been taken away by
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:53.740]   These governors and mayors who I don't know it's up to you to decide but after seven weeks of quarantine, I
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.660]   Think there should be some flexibility here, but hey, let's not get into that in conclusion
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:07.600]   Know that the unemployment benefits out there are strong and they are stronger in some states than others
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.880]   Before you relocate for a job think about what type of unemployment benefits and other safety nets they have
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:19.280]   The benefits are also indicative of the attitude the government the local government has
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.700]   For families and for individuals it just permeates through the government
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.620]   I know Hawaii is a very blue state and it's very family oriented
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.980]   And it really wants to help as many people as possible. Just kind of get ahead
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.460]   That's why Hawaii is one of the top states
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:42.940]   I want to relocate to but it's also because my family's there so find your favorite state
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.500]   Think about it. If you're in your existing state look at the charts and see what kind of benefits you can get
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.700]   Please get those benefits. This is the time to take advantage of these benefits
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:59.000]   Reset your life think about what you want to do and stay safe and strong everyone
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.140]   I miss you guys
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.860]   And if you enjoyed this ad free podcast, I'd love a positive review and for you to share it with your friends
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.100]   Take care. Stay safe. Be strong and good luck
