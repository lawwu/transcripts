[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700]   this line between a visionary and a fraudster, you know, you think that they're on two opposite
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.840]   ends of the spectrum, but in reality, they're where the ends of the circle meet the characteristics
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.980]   of one.
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.760]   One has that many of the characteristics of the other.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.200]   And sometimes I think the only thing that really separates the two is that the fraudster
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.460]   is able to keep getting money, raising money in order to get through the really difficult
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.360]   time where he or she isn't telling the truth.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.480]   And then that person goes down in history as a visionary.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.160]   But because no one ever looks back to the moment in time when they were lying, the fraudster
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.940]   gets caught in the middle.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.200]   So Enron's lost access to the capital markets, lost access to funding.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   As the market collapsed after the dot-com boom, and people began to wonder whether Skilling
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.600]   was telling the truth about Enron's broadband business, and then there were all the disclosures
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.040]   about Andy Fasta's partnerships.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.480]   If Enron had been able to continue raising money, this business of Enron's called Enron
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.480]   Broadband might well have been Netflix.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.560]   It was Netflix ahead of its time.
