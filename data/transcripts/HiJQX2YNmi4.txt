[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   For his text in this sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, the Doctor has taken the first 11 verses of the 5th chapter of the book of Acts.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   We begin our consideration of this solemn and extraordinary passage, this piece of history here in the 5th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, last Sunday evening.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We've come to it in the course of our study of what we are told here about the early church.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   We are studying this book, these early chapters, in order that we may discover what Christianity really is, what the Christian church is,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   what the message of the church is therefore in this world in which we find ourselves at this moment.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I need not remind you, nor take your time in reminding you, that we are living in a world that's in desperate trouble.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Confusion between nations, within nations, trouble, dissatisfaction, restlessness.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Never has the ancient word of the Old Testament been so approved and verified as today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And you look out and you see the restlessness and the trouble and the unhappiness of the peoples and the nations and individuals within these larger groupings and gatherings.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Now, I'm here just to say that there's only one message for a world like that, and that is the message of the Christian church, the message of the gospel.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Everything else has been tried, never more so than in this present century.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But clearly, it doesn't touch the situation.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Isn't it about time that men and women began to listen to this message again?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But you see, the moment I say that, the man outside turns to me and he says, and he's entitled to say it, "What is the message of the Christian church?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   What is your supposed Christianity, your supposed gospel?"
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And he says that because of the many voices that he hears speaking in the name of Christianity, in the name of the church.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So that he's bewildered and baffled, and he wants to know what the message, what the truth really is.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Now, my whole position is this, that there's only one honest thing to do.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It is to go back and read this story of how things were at the beginning.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   We've got no other authentic record. All else is purely personal opinion.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   This is how the thing began.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   There'd be no Christian church were it not for the things that are recorded in the four gospels, and here in these early chapters of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Whatever the church may have become, this is how she began.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And I go further and I argue that she should always be as she was at the beginning.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I am fortified in saying that by the long record and history of the church.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's been a strange history.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   A history of great power. A history of the losing of that power.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   The church at times has become effete, almost moribund, not counting at all.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Then suddenly there's another awakening, another great revival.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And what you find is that whenever you get these periods of revival and of reformation,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   that the church invariably returns to the condition that we find described here in the early chapters of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's why we're doing this. I have no other interest whatsoever.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I am concerned about the case of any individual in this congregation who is unhappy and miserable and defeated,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and who having tried almost everything, has come to his or her wit's ends and the end of the tether.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Here is a message of hope for anybody who cares to listen to it.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Very well, then. We are looking at this whole section for that reason.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And so we've come to this extraordinary statement.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now we began considering it last Sunday, and I remarked there in general of certain things that strike one at once,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   the amazing honesty of the record.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   We don't stand here to say the Christian church is perfect. She is not.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Here at the very beginning something happens which shows that she was never absolutely perfect, never.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Here trouble comes in almost as soon as she has come to the birth.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But the record is here, and it gives us the truth and all the facts.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And we are told about these two people, Ananias and Sapphira.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   We find something which is such a striking contrast to all we've read in the first four chapters.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   There is that idyllic picture of the Christian church rejoicing, happy together, sharing their goods.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Suddenly you come to this episode, and you see that there was trouble.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Suddenly these two people, Ananias and his wife Sapphira, are struck dead and are buried.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You realize what they did?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   They deliberately indulged in a piece of deceit and fraud.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   They were members of the early church who felt that they'd like to help one another.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   There was no compulsion, there was no law.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It was just a feeling that arose spontaneously that they'd like to share their goods with those who were in need.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And these people, seeing others do that, they decided they'd do the same.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But they had a qualification.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They pretended that they were giving the whole of what they'd received for their goods, but they didn't do so.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They conspired together, the two of them, to keep back a part, and to only give a certain amount.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   They gave the impression they'd given it all, but they kept a certain amount back for themselves.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And it is because of that action that God deals with them in judgment, in this terrifying manner that is described in the record.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Now, this is a very sober passage, and yet how vital it is for all of us.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Why? Well, it tells us, doesn't it, something about the church, and about the message of the gospel.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And the big thing we saw last Sunday night was this.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   That it is the unseen and the supernatural that rarely matters.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The church is not just an ethical, moral society.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   She is not like political societies or social societies.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   She's entirely different, and for this one reason, that there is always the unseen.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And the unseen, we are told here, and as we saw last Sunday night, is divided, you see, into two main sections.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   God, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, yes, but equally, Satan.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   In other words, the first great message of this gospel is to get us to realize that we are living in a spiritual world, a spiritual realm.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   The greatest lie of the devil is materialism.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   OK, what form it takes. You can have materialism, you know, without communism.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   People seem to think that the only materialism in the world today is dialectical materialism or communism.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It isn't. That's only one form of it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You can have religious people who are sheer materialists, and this is the great enemy today.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   The world is forgetting the unseen, the supernatural, the eternal.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And that's the cause, ultimately of all its tragedies.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But that's reminded, we're reminded of that here.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You know, they meet together, you see.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Suddenly, God acts, and the whole situation is changed.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But we're reminded equally of this constant operation of Satan, the devil, the god of this world, the prince of the power of the air,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   this evil, malign, personal power, that in his hatred of God, is always doing his utmost to mar God's work,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   whether it's the original creation or this new creation, which is called the Christian church.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Now, these are the things, you see, which are of such vital importance to all of us.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And this is a part of the message of the gospel.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   It tells us that we are all responsible to God, as Ananias was, as Sapphira was,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   that we are all of us in God's hands.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Whether we know it or not, it's the truth.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They didn't realize it, but they had to realize it, and it's true of all of us.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   What fools we are, to fail to realize that we're in the hands of powers and forces greater than ourselves.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Well, now then, you see, it is in a world like that, that the message of the church comes,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   this gospel, this thing that the apostles were sent out to preach.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You remember the Lord had said to them, just before his ascension,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "Tarry ye in Jerusalem, until ye be imbued with power from on high, and then you shall be witnesses unto me."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   He says, "I'm going to send you around to tell people about me, who I am, what I came into the world for,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   what I've done."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   This great good news of salvation, of deliverance, leading to a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Now then, here's the question.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That is still the message of the gospel.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's great good news.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It's a gospel of redemption, a gospel of deliverance,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   a gospel that gives people peace with God, peace with one another, and this great joy.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, here's the question.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Why is it that everybody in the world doesn't believe this message?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   That's the question.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   With the world in trouble, as it is, with everything else failing.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Why do men and women dismiss this without even considering it?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I think that's the great problem in the world today.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's the outstanding problem.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   A world that's at its wit's end won't even listen to this.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Why not?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Well, now, I've already given you part of the answer.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And the main part of the answer, and it can be put in one word, and that is, Satan, the devil,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   the god of this world, the blinded, the minds of them that believe not,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   How does he do this?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Well, he does it in the way I want to show you this evening.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I can put my answer to my question in this way.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I ask, why does the world not believe this gospel?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   The answer is, it doesn't see any need of it.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's as simple as that.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   It doesn't see any need of it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   If it saw a need, it would be ready to listen.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   It doesn't see the need.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's aware of certain needs, but it isn't aware of its true need, its real need.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And that is, I say, always the result of the work of the devil.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And here I want to show you this evening, we are shown in this incident,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I'm just expanding this incident as it speaks to us.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's an amazing incident.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   What it really tells us is this, you see, that the trouble with mankind still is
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   that it doesn't know what is wrong with itself.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   It's wrong with regard to the nature of its problem.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   It is wrong with regard to its fundamental need.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   That's why it doesn't believe the gospel.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   But this fundamental problem of need divides itself, I want to show you,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   into two main sections.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Mankind is wrong in its view of human nature.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   The modern man is wrong in his view of himself and what he is,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   what his needs are.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And secondly, he is completely wrong in his estimate of the forces
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   that are set against him.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now, I think we'll all agree about this, that men are conscious
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   that there's something wrong.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And they're aware that in this life and in this world there is a fight.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   But you see, the vital question is to know exactly what's wrong.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And to know exactly the nature of the forces that are opposed to us.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   What is it that is dogging the whole history of the human race?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Now, turn to your secular historians and they will give you the history
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   of the world's attempts to deal with itself and its problems.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   That is the so-called history of civilizations.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Men grappling with the problem.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Men have been extremely busy about this.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   There'd be no history books were it not for that.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Because you see, quite apart from wars and things like that,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   men have been really trying to solve the problem.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Even in their wars they claim they're looking for peace.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But in spite of all the effort and the striving and all the energy
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   that has been expended, the world is as we know it to be tonight.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And here is the great question.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   What is it in the human race that seems to be dogging its footsteps?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Or is it just when you think that everything's going to be right
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   that suddenly things go wrong?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   How often has that happened in the long story of the race?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   So much so that many historians, as you know,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   believe almost in a kind of cyclical theory.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   That the world just goes round in circles.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It appears to be going right up to the top.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Suddenly you find it doesn't.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It's on a curve and back it goes again to the bottom.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   It's a circle. Round and round the circle.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   You advance, you re-progress.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And on and on. Now what's the cause of this?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, here I say the two great problems
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   which the world must of necessity face.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And I want to put the two points to you tonight
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   in the light of this story of Ananias and Sapphira.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Because here it seems to me we are given such an insight
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   into the nature of the problem.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   What's wrong with the modern view of the problem of men?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Or with the modern view of the condition of men, if you prefer it?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Well, the first thing, obviously, that's wrong about it
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   is that it's superficial.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   You read the writings of men
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   who try and deal with the situation today,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   with the moral, political problems, and so on.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And you're at once struck by the fact that
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   they all have a very superficial view of the problem
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and the condition of men.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Generally, they're interested only in conduct.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You see, they get their statistics of juvenile delinquency
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and theft and robbery.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I believe that recently statistics have shown
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   that we've crossed the million mark
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   for the first time in indictable offenses,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   the criminal offenses committed in this country.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Now, these people are all interested in that.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You see, they start by looking at the actions.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And they think that the problem is entirely one of conduct
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   and of behavior and of actions.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   What can we do about the conduct of men and women?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   What can we do about their behavior?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   That's what they're interested in.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   They're not interested in men as such,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   but they're interested in how they react and how they live.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   You see, they start with what they call society
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and then the interrelationships.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   As they put it learnedly and cleverly,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   the question is, how can we get these people
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   who commit these crimes to become good members of society?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Their disturbances, they're disturbers of society
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   and of the even tenor of the life of society.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So the whole time, they're only looking at conduct.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Behavior, they're looking at the surface of the problem.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And the second fallacy goes with that
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   and follows from it almost of necessity.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   They think that this is a problem only
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   in connection with the minds of men.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   That the problem is entirely one of knowledge,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   one of information, one of instruction.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   They've got this idea that people behave as they do
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   because in a sense they don't know any better.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   It's a lack of training, it's a lack of intellectual apprehension,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   it's a lack of thinking.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And therefore they feel that the problem is really one
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   in connection with the mind of men,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   that nothing is involved here but just understanding
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   that these people haven't quite understood yet
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   that they've got to adjust themselves to society
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   and to other members of society
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and that you can't have an harmonious and a happy society
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   unless all people are thinking.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And then they begin to get an understanding
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   and so they accommodate themselves
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and you eliminate your problems.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Now I think you'll agree that that's a fair representation
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   of the view which is being taken of the problem
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   of individual men and of society at the present time.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Conduct only, and then, well, the thing that controls conduct
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   is the mind.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   In other words, people do what they do because they're ignorant.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And the solution to the problem therefore is education.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   This is what is still believed in.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   You'll find that this is true not only in the general view
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   of education in schools,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   you'll find that it is the controlling theory behind
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   the whole view of punishment of crime
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and of the way you treat your prisoners in prison.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The whole idea is rehabilitation as they call it,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   which means training people.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   You may have to call in your psychotherapists of course,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   but ultimately the whole thing is to get people to think straight.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's a problem of the mind and of thinking and of understanding.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   So you multiply your agencies which are designed
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   to treat the mind and to give you knowledge and instruction
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   to show the better way.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And once you do that, all is going to be well.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Well now, my friends, I'm just here to suggest to you this evening
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   that this one story of Ananias and Sapphira
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   is enough in and of itself to show how completely
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   and utterly superficial all that is.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Look at these people. Look what happened to them.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Look at this happening in the realm of the Christian church.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Can you explain Ananias and Sapphira merely in terms of lack of knowledge
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   or lack of understanding? Is that it?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Why do people behave like this?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Or take any one of the great illustrations of the same principle
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   that we find running right through the Bible.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Can you explain the conduct of men and women
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   merely in intellectual terms?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   You see, at once, the moment you bring these modern views
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   to the light of the scriptural teaching,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   you see that they're hopelessly superficial.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   They start only with conduct and then it's only a question of the mind.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Or, to put it positively,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   their real failure is to see that the essential problem
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   of the human race is the problem of the heart.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Now here is the great emphasis of the whole of the Bible.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   This is where, if I may so put it,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   biblical psychology shows its profundity.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Finally, I would put out of court every other theory
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   with regard to men and his welfare at the moment
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   entirely on those grounds alone.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Their complete failure psychologically.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   They talk so much about psychology,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   but it's their psychology that's wrong.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   That simply means the understanding of men
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and his behavior in his totality.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Here and here alone you get a real assessment
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and a real statement of true, profound psychology.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And the emphasis is always, you notice, on the heart.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Listen, Peter, you see, comes to the point at once.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Peter said, "Ananias,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   why hath Satan filled thine heart
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   to lie to the Holy Ghost?"
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And again, you see, the thing is repeated later on.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Peter says the same thing, in effect, to Sapphira
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   when she afterwards comes in.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   But listen to Peter again,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   working out his point with Ananias.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   He says, "Why hath Satan filled thine heart
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   to lie to the Holy Ghost
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   and to keep back part of the price of the land
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   while it remained, was it not thine own?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?"
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Which you remember means this.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   He said to start with, you needn't have sold it.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   But even after you'd sold it and had got the money,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   there was no compulsion even then for you to give it openly.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   You could have kept it all. It was still in your own power.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Twice over, you deliberately decided to deceive.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Why did you do it?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Then Aniapus goes on and puts it like this.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   "Why hast thou conceived this thing?"
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Well, in thy mind? No.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   In thine heart.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And there's the whole thing exposed.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Now here I say is the whole trouble with the modern matter.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   It has never seen that the problem is in the heart of men.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It's not an intellectual problem.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   It's not a problem of knowledge and of information.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   What is it? Oh, it's much deeper.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   The whole fantasy today is to regard men as only a mind.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Forgetting that there are other elements in him which are deeper and stronger,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   more profound and which control him and mar and ruin the whole of his life.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Well, here I say is the great message of the Bible.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   We are told of the devil Satan mentioned here.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   That what caused his original fall was that he lifted up his heart against God.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Jealousy.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Something deep and profound.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   He wasn't merely thinking.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   There was something that he desired to be equal with God.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   This is the thing that the Bible emphasizes.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And it emphasizes it everywhere with regard to men.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Now, I was emphasizing the honesty of the scriptures.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Let me take one notable example.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   One of the great men, one of the greatest men of the Old Testament is King David.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   That sweet psalmist of Israel.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   That beautiful young man.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   That man who honored God and obtained that great victory over Goliath.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   That man who really established the kingdom
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   and raised that kingdom to such great and wonderful heights.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Heights which he never quite attained afterwards.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Look at him. There he is.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   But you see the Bible is very honest.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   It tells us the truth about him.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   It tells us that King David was guilty of adultery and murder.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Why did he do that?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Was it a lack of knowledge?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Was it a lack of instruction?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Was it a lack of familiarity with the teaching of idealism?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Was it that he hadn't been sufficiently instructed in this art of accommodation of yourself to others in society?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Was it that he needed to be rehabilitated?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   You see the whole suggestion is so superficial.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   It's so ridiculous.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   David himself comes to see it eventually.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And he puts it honestly in the 51st Psalm.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   When he cries out in his agony.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Create within me a clean heart, O God.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And renew a right spirit within me.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   He knows where the trouble is.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   A man like David who got the insight that he had, who'd received messages from God.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And who knew what it was to be inspired by the Holy Spirit to write those incomparable Psalms.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Here's a man with a knowledge of God's law and of God's truth.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   He does these things.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Why does he do them?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Is his trouble only in the mind?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   God knows it isn't.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And David came to know it wasn't.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   The trouble is in the heart.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Create within me a clean heart, O God.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And renew a right spirit within me.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   It isn't the mind.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   It's the spirit.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   It's the heart.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   It's this deeper thing in human nature.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   That's the thing that's forgotten today.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   But you see our Lord, as we saw there in reading that portion out of Matthew 15 at the beginning is equally plain and equally explicit.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   The Pharisees and scribes went wrong about this self-same thing.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   But you see our Lord puts it quite plainly to them.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   His own disciples don't understand it.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   He said, "Do ye not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in of the mouth and goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draft?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And they defile the man, for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   These are the things that defile the man."
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   The heart is the center of personality.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   It doesn't merely mean the feelings and the emotions.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   It includes them.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But it's something even deeper.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   There is a center to every one of us.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   There is a great center out of which everything comes and which controls everything.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And the trouble with man is there.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   It's not in the realm of his mind only.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It isn't merely an intellectual problem.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   If it were, our educational systems would solve it.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   It isn't that.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   There is something in man that is deeper than all that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   That will make him contradict his knowledge and trample upon it and violate it.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He'll do wrong though he knows it's wrong.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   That's the trouble.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Oh, take again the way in which it was put by our blessed Lord.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's there in the third chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   This is the condemnation.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   That light has come into the world.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Well, why doesn't everybody believe it then?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And he gives the answer.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Here's the whole trouble.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It is the love of darkness.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   It's not that they're not aware of light, of course.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Men have had light.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   There's been light, as I say, brought forth by civilization apart from the revelation of God
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   throughout the running centuries.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   You can read your philosophers and their noble views of life,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   their exhortations to men to rise to that level.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   They've shown them the better way.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   They've shown them the folly and the futility and the madness of war and all these things.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   There's been no difficulty about having light and instruction and knowledge and information.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Never has the world had more of it than it's got tonight,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and yet our figures have never been so bad.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   We've crossed the million mark, as I reminded you, in these acts of crime and of violence.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   How do you explain these things?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Well, you see, there is only one explanation.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   The trouble isn't in the mind of men.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   The trouble is in the heart of men.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And any view of men which doesn't realize that the heart is the thing that matters
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   is already doomed to failure.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Here is the teaching, James puts it equally well in his epistle in connection with war.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   People, you see, are troubled by this.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Why in this enlightened age and generation do men still prepare for war,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   and why are there still wars?
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Whence come wars and fighting among you?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   There's only one answer.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   You lust and have not, you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   You fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not, and so on.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And that is the only true answer.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   You see, here's the story of Ananias and Sapphira.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Why did they do this?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Peter puts the question to them.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Why? Why have you done this?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Why hath Satan entered into thine heart?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   This is the question.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   What's the matter?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And that is still the only answer.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Man's not an intellect.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   With all the modern knowledge and all the scientific advancement,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   man still remains man.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   However much he knows, he's governed by what he likes, what he wants.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It isn't merely the poor and the ignorant and the illiterate
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   who are guilty of adultery and who pass through the divorce courts.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   No, no, the people who started it were at the other end of the scale.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   They started it.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's only gradually come down to the others.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   University professors are not paragons of all the virtues.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   No, no, they're involved in all this like everybody else.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   A man may have vast learning.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   He may be a miserable failure in the art of living.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Why?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   It's something deeper than the intellect.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   It's something deeper than the mind.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   The fact that a man has a great brain, a great mind,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   doesn't guarantee you anything about his life.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Why? Oh, he may have equally great drives, as they're called today.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Lusts, desires, passions.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And these are the things out of the heart.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Not the knowledge that goes in, if you like.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   It's that which comes out.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   It's this something that's vitiated, the very source of the fountain.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And all your efforts at purification, they come to nothing.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   You can multiply your psychotherapists in your prisons and everywhere else,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   and you can bring them into your schools, if you like, and they are doing so.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And you can spend millions more and more on educating society to adjust itself.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   It won't work, it won't pay you.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   The world is proving it.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   It's an utterly superficial view of the problem of mankind.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It hasn't realized that the trouble is in the heart and not in the mind.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   But let me go on to show another thing that comes out here so strikingly.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   The message here is that the trouble is not only in the heart,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   but that the heart is in a terrible state and condition, perverted and twisted.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Oh, so somebody. Fancy having to listen to something depressing like that.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   But wait a minute, my friend.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   What do you want? What are you out for?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Are you out for the truth or not?
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   If you're out for entertainment, well, you've come to the wrong place.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   If you want entertainment, well, you stay home and look at your television and wireless,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   and at the clever people who deny the gospel and make fun of it.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And there you will not get the truth, but you'll get flattery and you'll get entertainment.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   But we are here to consider truth.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   We are here because we are concerned about ourselves,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   about our lives in this world, about our death, about what lies beyond it.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   We are here because we are really concerned about the state of the world.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And very well, then, if we are, we mustn't talk about things being unpleasant.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   We are concerned about the truth. We want the truth.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Very well, here is the truth.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   The truth is that man's trouble is not only in his heart, but that his heart is rotten.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   That's a part of the preaching of the gospel.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Nobody else tells you that, but the gospel does.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Listen to Jeremiah putting it in the 17th chapter of his prophecy.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Who can know it?"
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   That is what the Bible says everywhere about the heart of man as he is by nature.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Who can know it?"
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I sometimes think that a man hasn't really started living
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   until he's discovered that about himself and his own heart.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   What the old teachers used to call "the plague of one's own heart."
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   If a man hasn't realized that his heart is desperately wicked and deceitful,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   he doesn't know himself.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   But here is the thing, you see, and it's illustrated in this story of Ananias and Sapphira to perfection.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Peter expresses his amazement.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   "Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   What made you do it? What brought you to do it?"
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Have you ever felt like that about yourself?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   You don't know yourself unless you have.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Haven't you been amazed at yourself and what you do and what you think?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   The thoughts that come to you and pass through your mind and that you accept and fundle.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   The murderous thoughts, the ugly foul thoughts.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Oh, haven't you ever said to yourself, "What is this evil that's in me?"
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   That's the teaching.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Now let me analyze that just for a little for you.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   You see, the heart of man is in this terrible state that he deceives himself.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Man is a fool, and he deceives himself.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He deceives himself about himself.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Man is such a fool and has got such a deceitful heart that he always thinks that he's better than he is.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   We're all guilty of that. We've all known that.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   We can always put up a wonderful defense.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Other people are worse than they think they are, but we, we're always better.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   So we deceive ourselves in that way, and then you notice our hearts are as deceitful as this.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   We think that we are very clever.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   That's always the fatal mistake men make.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   That's the fatal mistake that every criminal makes, isn't it?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Criminals are caught because they've always made a mistake.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   They think they're very clever.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   They've planned the perfect crime. Everything is catered for.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   They always generally make a mistake.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And there it is, this one mistake.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And this is man's big mistake. He's not as clever as he thinks he is.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Because Ananias and Sapphira, you see, they thought they could get the best of both worlds.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You'll get all the credit for having given this gift, but you've also kept back this portion for yourselves,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and you're going to live on that and enjoy that.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   You're pleasing the church, you're pleasing yourself.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   You're serving God and men, and we all think we can do this.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   We think we are extremely clever, but we just fool ourselves.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   It's a wonderful scheme. Ananias and Sapphira, husband and wife, they agreed.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   She knew all about it. They were in the arrangement together.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Whichever of them first thought of it, we don't know, and it doesn't matter.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   But they were both in it, and they thought this was marvelous.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   You get all the advantages of sacrifice, the public applause and approval.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And yet, you're getting what you want yourself by way of self-satisfaction.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Oh, the folly of men.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Our Lord looked at such people and he said, "You cannot serve God and men."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Yes, you want to go to heaven, but you want to get your fill of this world too, don't you?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   My friend, it can't be done. It's one or the other.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   You can't walk on the broad and the narrow way at the same time.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   It's a sheer impossibility.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   But there are many people who are trying to do it, and they're stretching their legs,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and they think they're clever. They're both. They've got everything.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They're in the church and outside.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   They believe and disbelieve as he chooses them.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Oh, the folly of men. The deceitful. Who can know it?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   What brings a man to do such a thing?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   But that's what we do by nature, every single one of us.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   But then, you see, I want to show you in another way how this works out.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   He not only deceives himself, he thinks he can deceive others.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Ananias and Sapphira thought they were fooling the whole church in their cleverness.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I don't stay with this. The thing is so wrong, isn't it? So disgusting.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Can't you see it as you look out at it?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   The deceitfulness of it all, the pretence, the shame, the hypocrisy.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Oh, how abominable. But isn't it true of every one of us?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   What's the impression we try to give to others?
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   That's the dishonesty that runs through society.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   The lie of the compliment. The lie of the appearance.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   It's the whole tragedy of the world tonight.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   That men and women are deliberately putting on masks.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   That's the meaning of hypocrisy in a sense.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Pretending to be what they're not.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And they think they're clever. They've carried it off.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   They've given the appearance.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Who can know it?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   But you see the height of the tragedy and the folly is seen in this.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   That it's quite convinced also that it can even deceive God.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   This is the problem. This is the thing we're dealing with.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   It isn't a little psychotherapy that people need.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   It's this thing down in the very depths that deceives the very men who's administering the psychotherapy himself.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   The thing that persuades a man, fool as he is, that he can even deceive God.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   But even God doesn't know that he can take in God as it were.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And that he's so clever, so subtle, so wonderful as a manipulator.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   That even God is deceitful.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Well my friends, there it is.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And the world doesn't realize this tonight you see.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   It offers these remedies because it doesn't realize that the problem is not only in the heart.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   But that the heart is so twisted, perverted, deceitful, unreliable, so damnable.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   That all these measures on the surface are condemned to nothing before they've ever started.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And that's the first great initial error in the thinking of the human race about its condition tonight.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   The second, you see, goes with it.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   It is this fatal wrong view about the powers that are set against us.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Indeed the world doesn't recognize that there are powers set against us.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   As I indicated last Sunday night, it doesn't recognize the existence of Satan.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   It ridicules that whole idea.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   It doesn't recognize that evil is something concrete and positive and objective.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   That's one of the great fallacies of modern thinking.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   What is called evil is regarded as artificial and not real.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Well what I mean is this, and you can read it for yourselves.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   The criticism of the biblical teaching is that the Bible regards evil as something positive.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   As something concrete.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   It tells us that it's all headed up in a person called Satan.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   The god of this world, who through his powers and emissaries is exercising this malign influence
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   upon the minds of men, upon their hearts, upon their very physical frames.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Now the modern man ridicules that.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   He says that's not the explanation of the problem of mankind.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's purely a question of knowledge.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Why do people fight?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Why do people go to war?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Why do the nations build up armaments?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Well he says, he still says it you know, tonight in 1966.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   He says it's all due to just a lack of thinking.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Lack of knowledge.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Lack of information.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Doesn't the world know the evil results and effects of war?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Have two world wars not taught us?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Is the trouble merely lack of information?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   No, no my dear friends it doesn't.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   It is that there is a power that is determined to keep this world in a state of ruination.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   That's the explanation.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   As I've often put it from this pulpit, the trouble is not your Hitlers and Mussolinis and Stalins.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Oh if it were we could deal with the problem.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   It's the one who governs them and uses them and raises them up and puts ideas to them.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And gives them their devilish cunning and their daring and their master's throats.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   You don't explain all this merely in terms of men.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   No, no.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   There's a power behind men.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And the things that are happening in the world tonight are giving evidence of positive, objective evil.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And of a great controller of the forces of evil.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   There is no other explanation of the recrudescence of witchcraft, devil worship.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   These things are going on in this country tonight. They're coming back by leaps and bounds.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Devil worship, witchcraft and all sorts of other hidden, malign and ugly things.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   And the educated, learned people going in for them, giving themselves to them, taking drugs to get a still greater experience of them.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Is this just due to some negative qualities in mankind?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   That's what we are asked to believe.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   We are told that what we regard and what the Bible teaches as positive evil is merely something negative.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   It's merely the absence of certain good qualities.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Or it is the mere failure to develop these qualities.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And here you see is the tragic cause of trouble that the world doesn't recognize the dominion of Satan.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   The slavery of sin.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   But that's the biblical teaching.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Sin says the apostle Paul in the sixth chapter of the Romans in verse 14.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   "Sin shall no longer have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace." Dominion.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   That's the tyranny of sin, the power of sin.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Or take again as he puts it in the 17th verse of that same chapter.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   "But God be thanked," he says, "that you were the servants, the slaves of sin."
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   "But he have believed from the heart that form of sound doctrine delivered unto you."
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   They were the slaves of sin.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   But no longer. You are no longer the servants of sin, but have become the servants of God and of righteousness.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And again the apostle puts it in the seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans when he says, "Here's my problem."
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   "With my mind I recognize the law of God, but I find another law in my members,"
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   "dragging me down and making me a captive to the law of sin and death."
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   That's the teaching of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   I am carnal, sold under sin.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   There is a power greater than myself, a power that is organizing evil and sin in me, in all men, in the whole of the universe.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   In addition to men's deceitful and regenerate heart, there is this tremendous power.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   "Why hath Satan felled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost?"
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   "Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?"
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   It's the devil, it's the suggestion, it's the evil one, the one who came into the garden of Eden and said,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   "Hath God said?" He still does, and he's still speaking and whispering and suggesting.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   And this, you see, according to this incident and according to the whole teaching of the Bible,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   is the only true and adequate explanation of the state and the condition of men.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   I begin by asking, "Why doesn't the whole world believe this gospel?"
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   And I'm giving you the answer to it.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   "The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   He says, "Don't listen. The problem is in your mind only, it's conduct only, and all you need is instruction,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   and the world is improving, and it can be improved."
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   It doesn't realize that the problem is down in the depths and the vitals and the center of men's being,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   and that it's the devil controlling the world and the flesh, this awful power.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   For, you see, the moment mankind comes to see and to believe that,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   it will then realize that the only hope for it is the hope that is offered it in this blessed gospel.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   You see, what the gospel says is this,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   What's it mean?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Well, it means this, that the great and eternal God sent his only Son into this world.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Why did he do so?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Why did the Son of God ever come into this world?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Why was the Son of God ever born as the babe of Bethlehem?
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Do you know the answer?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   It is because the heart is desperately wicked and deceitful.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Who can know it?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   It's because man is the slave and the dupe of the devil.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   It is because there was nothing else that could ever set man right.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Education, you say, God had given me, ten commandments, moral law, here it is.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   You want to know how to live, says God, here's my answer.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   You want instruction, I'll give you a Moses, I'll give you an Aaron, I'll raise my prophets.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   The Old Testament is God instructing men as to how to live.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   The knowledge is there, the great philosophers have taught it.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   It's not enough.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   You see, because the problem is in the heart of men,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   man cannot save himself.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   God must save.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   God alone can save.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Once you realize the deceitfulness of your heart and the power of the devil and of evil,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   you will see that there is only one hope for any individual or for society at large.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   It is that the Son of God should come into this world
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   and live a perfect life of obedience to God,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   should meet the devil and evil in all the power of their might,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   and defeat them, rapt them.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   And then, having done that,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   to take upon himself the load and the weight of our sin and our guilt,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   for we have all sinned against God,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   we've all done evil in his sight and we've all done it deliberately.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Like Ananias and Sapphira, we knew what we were doing.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   We knew God's law, conscience spoke and said, "It's wrong, you mustn't do it."
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   We said, "I will do it, I like it, I want it, I must have it."
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   That's the story of every single one of us.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   We have sinned against the light, against knowledge,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   against what we know to be the truth.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   We are all in the position of Ananias and Sapphira, there is no excuse.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   We cannot say we didn't know.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   We've all deliberately turned against God, turned our backs upon him,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   and we've sinned against him.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   We may have been even worse, we may have been hypocrites
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   who have pretended to believe in him and to serve him,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   and yet have lived according to our own desires,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   thinking that we could fool him.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   And we are all guilty therefore in the sight of God.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   And we can do nothing about that guilt.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   We can't remove it, we can't undo it.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   We can't promise to live better in the future.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   We've often promised, but we can't do it.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   Our New Year resolutions have already been forgotten,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   we are back to where we were, and we've done that a thousand times,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   and we know we'll go on doing it.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   There's no hope.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   You see my friends, this is where the gospel comes in.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Men don't see the need of the gospel because they've never seen themselves.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   They've never seen the nature of their problem.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   They've never seen the blackness, the vileness,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   the perversion of their own unregenerate hearts.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   They've never seen their rottenness, their final hopelessness before God.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   They've never seen that death is followed by judgment,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   and that in the judgment a sentence is pronounced of either eternal bliss or eternal misery.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   They've never seen it.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   But once they see that, they will turn to the gospel, they will fly to Christ.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   They will realize what's facing them, what's through them,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   and they will know that there's only one who can deliver them,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   deliver them from the condemnation of God's holy law,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   deliver them from this evil heart,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   create a new heart within them, and renew a right spirit within them.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   The Son of God, Jesus Christ,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   the one who just before his ascension gave these men the commission,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   telling them, "You shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, in Samaria,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   and to the uttermost parts of the earth,"
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   he's formed the church to say this,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   to call men and women to flee from the wrath to come,
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   to call them to repentance, to a facing of themselves,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   not only their actions, but the thing that led them to the actions,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   the evil, foul, unregenerate, perverted heart.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   The power of the devil and of hell,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   but to God's amazing love in Christ Jesus,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   that he so loved the world that he took our sins
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   and placed them on his own dearly beloved Son.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   He died to bear our punishment.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   His body was broken, his blood was shed.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   This communion service is proclaiming it, the bread and the wine.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   If you don't listen to me, listen to this.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Why this broken bread? Why this poured out wine?
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Oh, just to tell you that God so loved the world that he gave his Son to that.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   He laid our iniquity upon him.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   He has smitten him that you and I, believing in him,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   should be forgiven, should be cleansed,
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   should be washed with hyssop, should be made whiter than snow,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   should be given a new heart and a new nature and a new life
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   and a new start and new desires,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   which will lead us to love the light and hate the darkness,
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   instead of loving the darkness and hating the light.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   The thing we see so clearly in the case of Ananias and Sapphira
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   is the thing that is equally true of us all.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Why did you ever conceive in your heart to do this?
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   That's the question I ask you.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   Why have you ever conceived in your heart to do some of the things you've done?
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   Aren't you ashamed of yourself as you remember them now?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   What brought you to do it? How could you ever have done such things?
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   That's the question.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Why is it that the human race doesn't worship God and bow before him and live to his glory?
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Why does it make fun of his Son and especially of his death upon the cross
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   and ridicule the blood of the atonement? Why?
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Why does mankind spit into the face of God?
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   There's only one answer. Satan hath put it into thine heart.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   He's filled thine heart to do this thing.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   There's no other adequate explanation.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   And there's no other way of deliverance out of it,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   save that which is offered so freely tonight again
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   in Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   who gave himself for us,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   even while we were enemies, while we were frauds and hypocrites
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   and ugly and vile and foul,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   in order that believing in him we should not perish.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Ananias and Sapphira died.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   They rolled up their bodies in their cloaks and they carried them out.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   They perished in that earthly sense.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   They perished perhaps in a greater sense.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   And those who die and regenerate perish not only in life and in death,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   but through all eternity.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   But they should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   My dear friend, have you ever realized the state of your heart?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Have you seen that your reality is not life?
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   It's a new heart that can love the light and hate the darkness
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   and love God and go on to follow his dear Son
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   in the certain knowledge that in eternity you shall have the beatific vision,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   May that be the portion of everyone listening to these feeble words.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Amen.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
