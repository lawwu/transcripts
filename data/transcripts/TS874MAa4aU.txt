[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]   This is Scott Anderson, CEO for Desiring God.
[00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.400]   You and other friends of Desiring God make possible the work of this ministry, including this podcast.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.840]   Thanks for your part in helping us freely share the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.200]   A long-time financial donor to the ministry and a faithful listener to this podcast writes in to ask a follow-up question
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.360]   that's drawn from your article that you wrote on typology back on May 12th on the website.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. Thank you for your lesson on types. Please explain the differences between typology and analogy."
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.400]   I think the question has enough practical relevance for those of us who preach and teach so that
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.680]   when we get to the end, everybody should care about this, because even if we don't
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.560]   use the concept of type as often as others say in our preaching or teaching,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.080]   everybody, I think, should be using biblical analogies all the time.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.520]   So let me do a little education here on this typology thing. I wrote an article
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.320]   called "Typology—How God Targets Your Desires," which is at Desiring God, and I defined
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   a biblical type as having three traits.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.160]   And maybe before I mention those three traits and then how analogies are like them and not like them,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.280]   I should just clarify for the average listener who probably doesn't know at all what a type is
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.840]   and why it even matters.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.040]   Let me just explain. When Paul said in Romans 5:14, "Death reigned from Adam to Moses,
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.000]   even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam."
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.360]   Who is a type of the one who is to come? So Paul is saying
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.880]   Adam was a type—and that's his word, not ours—a type of
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.760]   Christ who is to come. So we're not just spinning our wheels in interesting literary chatter here.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.400]   We're trying to understand a biblical idea,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.560]   not just our idea that we've put on the text, like we created the idea of types. Types comes out of the Bible.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.920]   That's why it matters enough to spend time thinking about it. So the three traits that I argued
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.040]   define what a type is, is that, number one, the person or the object or the event that we're calling a type
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.000]   resembles what is coming. So there's a resemblance. And the thing that's coming,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.560]   like Christ is coming and Adam was the type, is the thing that's coming is sometimes called an
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.160]   anti-type. So, for example, in 1 Corinthians 10.6, Paul uses the word
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.320]   "type"—or it's translated "example" in some versions, but it's the same word as "type" in Romans 5—
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.600]   he uses the word "type" to refer, among other things, to passing through the Red Sea
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.280]   as a type of baptism. In other words, there's a resemblance.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.560]   You're moving from bondage to freedom, you're passing through water,
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.160]   you're following a leader, and when Paul sees that, he sees a
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.920]   resemblance, a picture, a foreshadowing of
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.360]   the
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.000]   baptism. And so
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.080]   resemblance is the first. And at this point, type and analogy are the same. If a person says, "Well, isn't that just an analogy?"
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.680]   You can say, "Yes, at this point it is, but that's not all there is to a type." So, number two,
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.840]   to be a type in the Bible, the resemblance has to be designed by God
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.120]   to make a point. It's not just an interesting correspondence. It's a design by God
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.440]   to link one part of redemptive history and the flow of history to a later part of
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.080]   redemptive history. And he makes this clear—Paul makes this clear in 1 Corinthians 10 when he says,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.480]   "These things took place as
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.120]   types of us,"
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.960]   meaning
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   God did that. God
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.840]   ordained that those events would have this
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.800]   resemblance to baptism. They're not just thought up by the reader;
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.760]   they are discerned by the reader as being intended by God. And now at this point you might say, "Well, can
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.240]   analogies also be willed by God?" Because he wills everything. His providence is over everything, so anytime there's a resemblance,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.440]   that would be an analogy. You could call that an analogy and not just a type. And I'm going to say at this point,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   yes, you could. You could talk about God-willed
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.080]   analogies. Okay, but the third characteristic of a type, I think,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.560]   distinguishes it from the ordinary understanding of
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.500]   analogy. And the third trait of a type is that it's prophetic; it predicts. God designed it not just to
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.400]   correspond to something in the future, but to point or to predict something in the future. And
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.640]   ordinarily, we don't think of analogies that way. Analogies are simply observed
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.800]   similarities, but types predict. They give insight into the plan that God has for
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.760]   the future. So that's the main
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.560]   difference. An analogy
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.360]   resembles—you could even think that analogies are designed by God to
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.440]   resemble—but analogies, at least in the ordinary way we think, do not
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.240]   predict. Now, the reason I said
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.920]   maybe this would be practically useful for
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.800]   teachers and preachers, anybody who
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   handles the Bible with somebody else in view, or even your own self,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.840]   but especially if you've got others in mind, is that I don't think we're free
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   to call something in the Bible a type
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.560]   just because it resembles something else in the Bible.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.300]   I think we should be careful, and let the New Testament give us cautious guidance
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.360]   what we put in the category of God-willed, predictive
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.880]   types. But I think that in our teaching and preaching,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.320]   we're free to draw analogies everywhere. Anytime we see an illuminating
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.520]   similarity, we can draw it out. Spurgeon did this like crazy.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   He was really good at it. I might say, "Let your words fly against the devil like stones from David's sling."
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.880]   Well, that's an analogy. I'm just making that up. When I say, "Your words flying against the devil,"
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.760]   I'm not saying, "Ah, the stones in the sling were a type of
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.520]   your words being written in Facebook." I'm not saying that.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.480]   I'm just saying that I can see a connection, and I can use the connection to add a punch or a force
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   to it without making any big biblical theological claim about
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.840]   the stones in the sling being a biblical type. Or I might say, "May the idols of secularism
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.680]   come crashing down like Dagon in the Philistine temple."
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.240]   I mean, that's a way of talking that is analogical. I'm seeing connections,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.640]   I'm drawing them out, or I could say, "Like a great avalanche on Mount Everest," for that matter.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.480]   It doesn't even have to come from the Bible.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.160]   It's just the way we talk, and when analogies are found in the Bible to some point we want to make, I think it can add
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.960]   a remarkable,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.520]   provocative, memorable twist to our point, which is what Spurgeon did so effectively.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.400]   So, in our preaching and teaching,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.720]   let's be careful to draw out the biblically clear types
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:24.760]   that weave redemptive history together, and let's be lavish and free to use as many
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.520]   provocative analogies as we can.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.720]   Wonderful. Thank you, Pastor John. And you can get that article that we mentioned earlier,
