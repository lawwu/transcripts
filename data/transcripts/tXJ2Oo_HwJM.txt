[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   This week we are joined on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   with Dr. Richard Lentz,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.920]   the Vice President for Academic Affairs
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.900]   and Dean of the main campus of Gordon-Conwell
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.220]   Theological Seminary, just a short drive north of Boston.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.840]   Dr. Lentz is also the author of a book
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.320]   that releases this winter titled
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.640]   Identity and Idolatry, the Image of God and Its Inversion
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.600]   in Don Carson's Silver Series,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.640]   New Studies in Biblical Theology.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240]   Dr. Lentz, you develop an interesting point
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   on Romans 1 in your new book,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.400]   when you point out that sinners exchange God
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.880]   for created things, this is idolatry of course,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   but you go on to point out this,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.360]   quote, "Humans have persuaded themselves into thinking
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240]   "that other created things
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.360]   "will satisfy their deepest longings.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.080]   "The apparent wisdom in this is the illusion
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.220]   "that created things can be more easily controlled
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.120]   "than the creator," end quote.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.080]   There's something profound about our desire
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.720]   to be deeply satisfied in the things that we can control.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.760]   Control freaks love idols, explain this.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.480]   - Yeah, and I do think that there is something
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.480]   really unique about contemporary idols in this respect.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.240]   Although the dynamic of control
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.480]   is present in most forms of idolatry across every age,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.800]   across every culture, but what's unique in our time
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   as we think about the idols of our own hearts
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.080]   is that we believe they are more easily controlled
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.240]   than the living God.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.360]   And in part, that's not, I mean,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   there's some wisdom in that.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.200]   That is, you don't control the living God.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   And so the natural instinct in a fallen creature
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.760]   is to suppose I need to find things that will satisfy me
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.720]   or give me significance that I have a greater control of,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.120]   therefore, have greater control of my own identity.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.880]   Now, I think that arises for most of us
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.400]   in this context of believing that we have access
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.120]   to greater tools of choice and control.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   So we have this mistaken impression
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020]   that we live in a world where,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.980]   because we have so many choices,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.580]   we can control our destiny more than we could have
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.020]   in an earlier age.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.020]   And what progress means, that language of progress
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.260]   is the language of choice and control.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.580]   The deeply unsatisfying part
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.580]   of this great contemporary myth
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.580]   is that we all also feel overwhelmed, paralyzed almost,
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.220]   by the amount of choices that we have in our lives,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.900]   that most people experience in the West,
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.500]   in most of our cultural context,
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.940]   that these choices become overwhelming.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.200]   And that's also another dynamic of idolatry.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.940]   We recognize that our idols are controlling us.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.380]   And so I think it's not a cultural accident
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.700]   that burnout is a common experience,
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.020]   that busyness, sheer simple busyness,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.740]   seems a pressing personal dilemma for many people.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.140]   There are too many things to do.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.460]   And that's, of course, the other side
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.260]   or the result of believing
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.520]   that we can control our environment
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.840]   by expressing how many choices we have.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.160]   So one enters into the grocery store
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.420]   and becomes almost overwhelmed
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.300]   by the number of choices,
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.620]   how many different kinds of ketchup,
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.420]   how many different kinds of cereals.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.900]   I mean, just as a small anecdote,
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.600]   and then you multiply that exponentially in all of life,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.180]   and it becomes paralyzing for us.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.940]   That's the end result of idolatry.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.820]   Burnout, depression, feeling of discouragement,
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.820]   losing hope, feeling unsatisfied,
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.660]   all those personal emotions are natural results
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.500]   of idols that don't satisfy.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.340]   - Amen, yeah.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.100]   And speaking of things we think we can control,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.580]   we live in a digital age.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.460]   We are lured to our smartphones,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.780]   a world that we can completely shape and mold
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.040]   into our own personal preferences.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.020]   And it draws our attention, obviously.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.820]   A 2014 study published
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.440]   in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.980]   titled "The Invisible Addiction"
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.260]   concluded that the average college student
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.220]   now spends nine hours a day on their phones.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.900]   Knowing why God created us,
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.540]   when you hear this, how do you respond?
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.700]   - Yeah, and so two thoughts
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.780]   at different ends of the spectrum here.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.940]   I mean, the first thought is that technology
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.960]   as an object in its own right
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.860]   ought to be viewed with deep respect
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.860]   and some sense of awe as to what we are able to accomplish.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.660]   That technology and the digital revolution
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.180]   that we've experienced in the last 15 years
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.020]   is not a creation of the devil.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.020]   We need to be careful of a kind of technophobia,
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.340]   a fear of technology.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.820]   On the other hand, and there's always the other side also,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.860]   the blessings and the curses,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.820]   that which is good in every age
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.860]   can be used in a fashion that is actually destructive.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.860]   And so technology, by the sheer power of its abilities,
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.500]   draws us to it.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.020]   So it's not that long ago
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.900]   that we were first discovering personal computers.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.260]   I mean, it's only been 20 years or so
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.460]   since the personal computer revolution.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.120]   And now just the speed with which that revolution
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.900]   has taken shape and form for most of us
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.860]   is that we recognize now we've got this powerful
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.340]   little thing in our hands called the smartphone,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.220]   and it promises to give us access
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.380]   to the whole world instantaneously.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.580]   And you could, you know, standing back in 100 years,
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.900]   if the Lord parries, or if you had lived 100 years ago
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.620]   and been able to see the future for whatever reason,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.260]   you would have recognized,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.020]   gosh, that would be a very powerful idol.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.420]   You could see why people would be attracted to it,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.020]   drawn to it.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.620]   It gives great power.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.340]   It gives great access.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.220]   But of course, it's also addictive.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.700]   I mean, even the statistics there, nine hours a day,
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.460]   suggest that there is something almost magnetic
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.260]   that draws us to it, that we can't live without it.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.180]   And so though I'd be cautious of using language
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.460]   that has become our own god,
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.740]   the addictive dynamic involved with it
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.580]   ought to teach us something about our own hearts.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.380]   It tells us, in part, that we do need
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.500]   to have access to others,
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.820]   that it seems to be promises the relationships to others
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.060]   instantaneously on our own terms,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.060]   conveniently when we want it, where we want it.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.140]   Again, you have all those dynamics of choice and control.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.140]   And so youth pastors that have taken kids out
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.620]   and said, "We're gonna have a technology-free day,"
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.620]   have really often experienced this kind of new world,
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.100]   helped the kids experience something
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.020]   they've never experienced before.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.420]   That is that there actually is a richness to life
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.340]   without technology,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.980]   and helps you see technology then in a different light.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.940]   So I think sometimes when you pull the idol out,
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.900]   there is a great sense of loss,
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.500]   and that's true when you pull a smartphone away
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.700]   from a teenager that lives on it for nine hours a day.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.420]   - Yes, and that is very important.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.320]   Idols are something we can't imagine living without.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.280]   Let's pick up here tomorrow.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.460]   Thank you for joining us on the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.340]   with guest Dr. Richard Lentz.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.580]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.680]   I'll see you tomorrow.
