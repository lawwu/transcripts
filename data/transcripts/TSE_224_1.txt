[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Take it away.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Welcome to the show, Josh.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Dude, I'm glad to be here.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You know, I am so excited to have you.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You're going to lay it on me today with some good knowledge.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I know it. I know it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And Josh, as you know, this episode is called Sales from the Street.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And what I like to do with these episodes is bring guests on,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   folks who are out there hustling just like you and me,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   share, you know, real life experience,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   some of the challenges that they had,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and how they overcame those challenges and results they saw
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   from the solution they implemented.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But before we dive into that,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I want you to tell us a little bit more about what you're doing with Radical Finance.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, so now I host a podcast called Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So I'm selling in a very different format now,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   kind of like you selling ideas in a public format.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I came from a six-year career in life insurance and investment sales,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   working with a company called Northwestern Mutual.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I had previously been working for a large corporation in an analyst position,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and I was sick and tired of the income that I was earning.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I got a 5% pay raise, and I thought to myself,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   "5%? I deserve a 55% pay raise."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Not a, actually, it was an 8%.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Anyway, I wanted a much bigger pay raise than I was given.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And so when I, at that time, I realized I needed to go into
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   a more financially lucrative profession.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And so to become a highly compensated employee,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I decided that the best path was to go into an area
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   where my income was driven by my results.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So I chose sales, and I wanted to learn to be a professional salesperson.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I always enjoyed the topic of finance,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   so I chose a financial company called Northwestern Mutual.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I chose them primarily simply because when I was researching it,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   they were known to have one of the better sales training programs.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And I figured, "Well, I'll go do it for three years,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and if nothing else, I'll learn to be a salesperson."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And those are strategies and tools I can take with me for the rest of my life.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Found those spending six years there, really enjoyed it,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and then launched out of there to start my business now
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   called Radical Personal Finance, where I host a daily,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   in-depth, personal financial planning podcast
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   where I teach people to become financially independent
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   in about 10 years or less.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   - That is awesome. That is great, and I love it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And I think that's something that, obviously,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   if anyone out there listening who are in the sales world
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   can definitely connect with you on that,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   because if they're making the money now,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   they listen to the show, or they're making the income,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   they need to learn how to manage that money.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So, highly recommend that you check out.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And we'll put all this stuff in the show notes as well,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   so they can check out your podcast.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But let's talk about some of the challenges you faced
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   when you first came into sales.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   What are some of those things that you, the initial challenge,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   like one of the most difficult things that you came upon?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   - Most difficult thing was that when I started,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I was 23 years old, and I was scared of everything that moved.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   (laughing)
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And when you put a 23-year-old who's scared of his own shadow
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   into the world of sales, you have to learn some things.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I remember the first day I had to make phone calls.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   In our business, we worked on what we called
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   a referred lead prospecting system.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So, I would call, the way I started my business,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I called everyone I knew, I asked them for an appointment
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   to share with them what I was doing,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and I would maybe be able to be of service to them,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   but also ask for referrals to other people.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And I remember just walking around the phone
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   the very first day of training for about 45 minutes
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   before I had the guts to pick up the phone and call somebody.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And that was a consistent theme over the years,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   that I had to learn how to overcome
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   all of those deep-held fears of other people.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And the biggest challenge for me was really getting referrals.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   In a referred lead prospecting system,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   the way that it worked is I would work with somebody,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and then I would ask each and every time
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   for them to introduce me to other people.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And we talked about the sales from the street episode.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I would say that for me, one of the major transformations
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   occurred when I had a client where I stopped selling
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and started listening.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   The way financial sales works is you'd have to do
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   some amount of listening, but then after you do
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   some listening, then you gotta start selling,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   'cause you gotta place your product,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   whether it's an insurance policy,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   whether it's an investment product,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   you've gotta actually follow through
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and start making the presentation.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And that's right, and that's fine.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   But there was sometimes a challenge with regard
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to financial topics of when's the right time
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   to make the transition.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Early in my career, I learned from other people,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and I would do a little bit of listening
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and then start talking.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And as I progressed year after year,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I just started spending more and more time listening
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and less and less time talking.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And it culminated with a scenario where somebody
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   that was introduced to me came into my office,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and says, "Josh, we wanna talk to you."
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And they came into my office, and I sat down,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and I just spent an hour listening to them.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I didn't sell them anything.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I didn't actually place a single financial product
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   with them in that hour, nor did I even talk about it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But I spent an hour listening to them talk
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   about their goals and what they were trying to accomplish.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   What happened was they left my office,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   they sold their house, and they put a plan in place
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   to pay off their student loan debt.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But the really remarkable thing to me
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   was a few weeks later, they invited me and my wife
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   to their child's birthday party.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And at that birthday party, when I walked in,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   they basically made a massive announcement to the room.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   "Hey, everybody, this is Joshua Sheets.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   He's our financial advisor."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And my hosts practically walked me around the room
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and said to each and every person,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   "This is Joshua, he is awesome.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You should talk to him.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   This is Joshua, he is awesome.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   You should talk to him."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And what that resulted in was a major transformation
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   for me where I realized that I had gone from
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   it being difficult to get referrals from people
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   to this specific client walking me around the room
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and telling everybody that they should meet with me.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And it caused me to continue the track I was on
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   of approaching the business in a very different way
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   where I went in with fewer and fewer plans
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and just spent more time listening.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And from then on, it basically solved
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   the referral problem for me where I didn't have
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   to work very hard to get referrals,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   but because I had been able to genuinely,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   authentically create such a feeling of being heard
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and listened, created such goodwill in my clients
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   that they wanted everybody to work with me.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   It was a real epiphany for me in my sales career.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   - That is great.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I love the fact that you mentioned there
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   that you listened a lot.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And I like the fact how this client,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   because you listened, in his mind,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   he probably felt like you gave him so much,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   so many great advice that day,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   but all you did was really sit back
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   and he kind of almost educated himself in a sense,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   but built such a great relationship.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And I feel that's a lot of place,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   that's an area a lot of salespeople,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   especially those who are new,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   have a difficult time with
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   because you're taught these training things.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   You learn about your great product or your service
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and you want to tell everybody about it
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   because you know it's going to help them.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   But it's kind of like an oxymoron.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Sometimes you need to talk less.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   - When I was brand new in training,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   we used a form in the financial business
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   called a fact-finding form.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And it was basically about a 16-page questionnaire
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and had all the questions written on it
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   that you were supposed to ask your prospective client.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And somebody told me in training,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   "You can be an idiot,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   "but if you just ask people these questions,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   "you'll open cases and you'll close business."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So I took them literally in the beginning
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   and I just went out and I asked people all the questions.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   On that questionnaire,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   the final stage of the questions that I learned
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   in the last couple of steps
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   was about setting up for the referral prospecting.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And it was called confirming the appointment basically
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   and then setting it up to ask for referrals.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And one of the questions that I would always ask is,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   "How did you feel about the process today?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And remember, I didn't know a thing.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I was just asking, asking, asking, asking.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   (laughing)
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   But I would get to the end of the form
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and before, at this stage, before I knew anything,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I would just ask, ask, ask,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and they would be like, "Man, this has been awesome.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   "You really seem like you know what you're talking about."
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   (laughing)
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And here I was, quaking in my boots at 23 years old
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   and they're telling me,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   "Joshua, you really seem like you know
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   "what you're talking about."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Inside I'm saying, "I didn't say a thing.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "All I did was ask the questions
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   "that are printed on the paper."
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   But I learned if you listen well enough,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   people will think that you know what you're talking about
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   because of the way that you made them feel.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And then I was able to, at that time,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   take the form back to my office,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   find out the answers, prepare the recommendations,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and come back and provide something helpful.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But the more we listen in sales,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   the better the results.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And it's probably really hard to press that too far.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   - You know, and the thing about it too
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   is the fact that you had the questions written out.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Because, and by the way, that's how I look so good,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   because I just ask people questions on a podcast
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   and they think I know stuff.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   (laughing)
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But the thing I like about it too
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   is the fact that you had the questions written down.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And it never ceases to amaze me.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   People who do really well in sales,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   they focus on the details, little things like that.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Instead of winging it and saying,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   "Oh, I got these questions in my mind."
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   You have them written out, you have them known.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And I mean, over time, sure,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   you can get those to become a part of you
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   and second nature,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   but there's a power in taking details,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   writing out the question,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   the most important questions, crucial questions.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And in a situation like this,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   you come back like a genius.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   - I used to train new reps,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and I firmly believe this.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   When you're in a sales capacity
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   where every day you're in front of prospects and clients,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   there should be nothing coming out of your mouth, really,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   that's not memorized, that's not scripted,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and that's not prepared.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Now, there are situations
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   where you'll be asked a new question
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   or you'll work on an angle.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   But then after the appointment,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   you go back and you ask,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "Did I do that very well?"
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And if you start to do that,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   what happens is you stop worrying
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   about what you're gonna say
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and you start focusing on how you say it.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And that's how you really, really engage people
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   is by not thinking about what you're gonna say,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   but by thinking about how they're feeling
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and how they are responding to what you're saying.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   If you're thinking about your lines,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   the next thing that you're gonna say,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   you can't think about how the other person is responding.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   But if you know what you're gonna say,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   then you can focus on how you're delivering it
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and you can focus on really engaging.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So one thing that I learned a lot,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and I just see so few salespeople do,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   is everything should be scripted.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Everything should be practiced, practiced, practiced,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   practiced, practiced.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   In the early years,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I would sit down with other reps
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and we would sit down on Saturday morning
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and I'd film myself delivering my approach language,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   delivering my phoning scripts.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I'd record the phone calls
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and I'd go back and listen to them
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and ask myself,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   "Would I take an appointment from me?"
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And when you focus so much on internalizing the words,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   then you can forget about the words
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and you can really dig into the delivery
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and it makes all the difference in the world.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Dude, was it tough watching yourself
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   or listening to yourself the first couple times?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Oh, I hate it.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   But I also learned everybody hates it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   We all hate it.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And it's so valuable.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I recorded tons of calls
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   that I never wanted to listen to.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But even just recording,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   even if I didn't listen to them,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   it still made me pay attention.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And then what also would help
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   is I would listen to other reps
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   and I would focus on the things I learned well
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and the other reps.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And I learned,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I don't know,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   a little bit of advice to your listeners.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   If you're working with other salespeople,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   listen to what all the other salespeople are doing
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   and do the exact opposite.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   (laughing)
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And it sounds weird.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   I'm not sure how much you go into things
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   like phoning technique and all of that.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   But the instant somebody calls you,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   you can know that they're a salesperson.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And since all of my initial introductory appointments
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   were set on the phone,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   in financial sales,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   you have to learn how to be very good on the phone
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   right off the bat.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And all you need to do to learn
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   to be very good on the phone
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   is listen to everyone's around you
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   and then record yourself
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and do the exact opposite.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   So I never, for example,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   started with, "Hi, Donald,"
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   or anything like that.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I would always,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   if I were calling you for an appointment,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I would basically,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   my coworkers made fun of me,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I would basically yell at you like,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   "Don, hey, this is Joshua Sheets."
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And I would go on with the little script.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   But those little cues,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   you only pick them up in learning about them.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Even one little thing I learned by listening
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and also studying and learning from other people
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   was that little hesitation.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   So when I would say my name,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I would say, "This is Joshua Sheets,"
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   and I would pause a moment.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   What that little tiny pause does
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   is it makes your brain,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   when I call you,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and you don't know who I am,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   you just pick up the phone,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   it makes you immediately start searching
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and say, "Joshua, Joshua, Joshua,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   who's Joshua, who's Joshua?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Oh, Joshua Sheets."
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And it makes me sound like I know you.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And in financial sales,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   you've got to break that first couple of seconds
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   to give yourself just about, you know,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   a minute or two on the phone
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   to be able to share why you're calling,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   who introduced you,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   what your perspective is.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And all those little things can only be done
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   when you know your script's cold
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   and you don't have to worry about what you're going to say.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   - Oh, man, dude, you hit home
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   with some of this good stuff, man.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I've done a couple episodes recently,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   had guests speak about the idea of scripts.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Some people hate it.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I hated it, Josh.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But, you know, the more that I did them,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   the more I saw improvement.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And I did some acting in high school,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   theater stuff,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and you saw the benefit
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   of getting the script, memorizing the script,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   and then being able to live and mold that script.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And there was a big difference.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The big difference between being a robot
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and having a script that guides you.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   - If you know the script,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   it allows you to adjust it.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   So I used to teach phoning,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and I'm just focusing on that
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   'cause it's one of the--
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   - If you can't phone,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   you have no ability to get in front
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   of a client for fact-finding.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You have no ability to put together a solution.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   You have no ability to do your presentation.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   It all starts on the phone.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And something is simple with phoning
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   is having a script and knowing where
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   you're going to lead people.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So what I always did is I was always
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   trying to call based upon a referred lead prospect.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And so simple thing like my script
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   was very carefully honed
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   to get responses little by little over time
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   so that the prospective client
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   was willing to answer me.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   So example would be like, you know,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   my initial phoning language.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "Don, this is Joshua Sheets,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   "Joshua Sheets calling.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   "Hey, I'm a friend of Joe Smith's.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   "Did Joe give you a call
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "and let you know I was be calling
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   "or am I calling you out of the blue?"
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And that initial line that I developed
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   was really, really useful
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   because you would always respond,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   "Oh, no, he didn't."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And then I would again defuse the situation,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   make it sound a little more casual.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I would do a big, "Oh, come on,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   "I gotta get on Joe.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   "He promised me he was gonna call you
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   "'cause I always told him to call,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   "but they never call.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   "Everyone's busy, so I'll get on Joe for that."
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And then I would go in
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and all through the script,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I would have an alternative choice response,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   but instead of it sounding
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   like the traditional stilted 1982,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   "Are you available on Tuesday at 10 a.m.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   "or Thursday at 2 p.m. thing?"
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   The alternative choice can be much more elegant.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   So my alternative choice was,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   "Okay, do you have a moment?"
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So I would, first alternative choice,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   "Did Joe tell you that I was gonna be calling
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   "or am I calling you out of the blue?"
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   "Oh, you got me out of the blue."
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   "Bummer, okay, I'll get on Joe for that.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   "All right, real quick, I'll be super, super quick.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   "Do you have a quick second to speak
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   "or did I get you to bad time?"
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And so for me, I always needed to ask that question
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   because I needed about two or three minutes on the phone
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   to set up why I was calling,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   who I was calling from,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   and those kinds of things.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And if somebody's standing,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   people answer their cell phones now
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   when they're standing in front of a board meeting.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And there is no chance in the world
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   that I'm gonna set up an appointment
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   with somebody standing in front of a board meeting.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So it's an alternative choice.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Then I would go into about a 30-second thing
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   of here's who I am, here's who I work for,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   here's the type of work I do,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   here's why I'm calling,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   here's what Joe said about you and why I'm calling,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   and then go into just some simple alternative choice
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   of I'm gonna be down in your area on Tuesday.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Is it all right for me to swing by Tuesday
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   or is there another time that's better for you?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Or are you a daytime guy or an evening guy?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Or are you a morning guy or an afternoon guy?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Or whatever the situation is, and try to do that.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   So you can take, with practice and with scripting,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   you can take the time-tested, honored approaches
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   from professional selling,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   things that have been developed and tested,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   and you can hone them a little bit
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and make them more elegant for the day.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Make them more elegant for today's world.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   - Oh man, dude, you hit home on all this stuff.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Man, I love it.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I love it.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   If there's one thing you would like someone listening
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   to this, new to sales or seasoned sales,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   there's one piece that you want them to walk away with.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   What's that one piece of advice, Josh?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   - If you do good work, that will speak broader
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   than any tactic or technique.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   If you are a person worth referring,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   you won't need any tricks or gimmicks.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Good technique is important for good salespeople.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   You should be a professional.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So you should do good work,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   and you should have great technique.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   But don't ever try to fool people with great technique
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   when you do really bad work.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   So focus, if you've got to focus,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   spend most of your time focused on being a person
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   who's worth referring,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   being a person who's worth buying from,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   being an expert in your industry.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Spend the vast majority of your time on that,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and a little bit of your time focusing on technique.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   We've just done this whole thing here on technique.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   But to be a true professional,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   spend a lot of time on being a person
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   worth doing business with.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And then also, don't forget about technique.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And that will rocket your sales into the stratosphere.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   - Love it, love it, man.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   If folks want to get in touch with you,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   what's the best way for them to connect with you?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   - Best way is to listen to the show,

[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   - Mm, mm, mm.
