[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   On Wednesday, Pastor John, you answered the question over whether or not a premarital
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:16.080]   pregnancy nullifies the unequally yoked prohibition of a believer marrying an unbeliever if they
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.800]   have a child together.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.380]   Today the scenario changes.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.120]   Today we talk about a pregnancy between two professing believers who sinned together.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.040]   The question comes to us from William.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.000]   Hello, Pastor John, I became a Christian about two years ago, even though I grew up in a
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.840]   Christian household.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.860]   I am now greatly troubled to admit that I had sex with my girlfriend who I met at church
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.140]   a few months ago.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.560]   We are devastated at the sin that we have committed together, despite the times we said
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.440]   we would not do it.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   Now I fear my girlfriend is pregnant.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.480]   I have frantically listened to every podcast about abortion, and I'm such a hypocrite to
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   let my mind even entertain this as an option, when for years I declared that I never would.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.740]   But here I am, scared.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.400]   If it is true and my girlfriend is pregnant, what do we do?
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.960]   How have you counseled couples who are broken and fearful and find themselves in our situation?
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.720]   William, I don't know your age.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.120]   I don't know your maturity or spiritual condition or your parents or your church.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:38.880]   So all of my counsel here will have to be general, and the best I can do, not knowing
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.700]   your situation more closely.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.440]   We are going to get to the point where I'm going to say, "Don't lean only on my counsel.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.800]   Go to your pastor."
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   But let's get there.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.480]   It seems to me that you are genuinely contrite, and since the magnitude of the sin and the
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:09.600]   heartache that you have caused is huge and may even get worse, yes, let me begin with
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.040]   a few encouraging things first.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:22.320]   The fact that you, as the man in this couple, have written to me and you didn't dump that
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.040]   responsibility onto your girlfriend is a good sign.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.680]   You have taken responsibility and initiative, and that's good.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.800]   And I'll come back to that in just a minute, because your manhood is a huge issue right
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.080]   now and what you make of it.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:51.000]   "Do not entertain any thoughts that you have sinned your way out of Christ or out of heaven."
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.560]   Those would be thoughts of the devil and his accusation.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.280]   If you confess your sins and humble yourself before Christ as your Lord and Savior and
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.320]   treasure, you will be forgiven, and you will be given strength to do what is right in this
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.480]   situation.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   Your life may be very troubled short-term or even long-term because of this sin, but
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.760]   God will turn all those troubles for your sanctification if you will trust Him and turn
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.240]   from sin and devote yourself utterly to Jesus.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.440]   So here's what I would recommend.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.640]   And yes, I have spoken to others in your situation and told them these very things.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.160]   First, you, you, William, are a man.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.640]   That means that you bear a peculiar and primary responsibility for leadership in this relationship.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.880]   That means that your sexual sin is aggravated by your failure to steward this leadership.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   I'm not at all denying that your girlfriend bears responsibility and complicity in the
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   sin.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.560]   She should have said no and kicked you out.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:25.000]   But I am saying that the man, the man, you, bears a greater responsibility and is charged
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.160]   by God to protect and care for and lead.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.920]   So even if she did in some way lure you into this, that's irrelevant when it comes to your
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.840]   unique God-given responsibility as the man in this relationship.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:56.640]   So now that you have misused that calling as a man, you have failed to steward that
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.360]   special responsibility, you have a chance in this terrible situation to redeem at least
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.400]   your role as a courageous, initiative-taking, humble leader in doing what is right, which
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.240]   will be very difficult.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   Believe me, the temptation will be to do just the opposite.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:28.200]   It will be blame-shifting, self-pity, fear, pouting, moodiness, withdrawal.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.920]   That's what men fall prey to, and they abandon their manhood and they abandon the path of
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.080]   Jesus when they do that.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.640]   These are all failures of Christian manhood.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.920]   Don't go there.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.560]   Take the initiative in doing the right thing.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.800]   Now that means first that you are the one who will say, "We will not kill this baby,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.160]   period.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.940]   We brought this baby unlawfully into the world, and we will not add to the unlawfulness of
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.040]   our creation the unlawfulness of its destruction.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.760]   No, we won't."
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.960]   Take the lead, be courageous for the cause of justice and mercy and life.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.320]   Next, leadership here means leadership in repentance, setting the tone for not minimizing
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.560]   the sin and taking the lead to go to both sets of parents.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.960]   I am saying this, going to both sets of parents, confessing your sins, and then go to your
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.840]   pastor and confess your sin.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.200]   Because membership in a local church implies a lifestyle that is exemplary, which this
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.840]   isn't, confessing to her parents will probably be the hardest thing.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.240]   In some settings, it could cost you your life.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.560]   I'm not kidding.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.800]   In some cultures, it would cost you your life to do this.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.880]   It's the right thing to do.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.960]   This is where you man up.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   You call her father on the telephone, and you tell him you need to talk to him face-to-face
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.560]   soon.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.400]   You meet with him, and you look him in the eye, and you confess, "I failed to protect
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   your daughter.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.480]   I don't care if she took the initiative or somehow lured you into this."
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:33.520]   You tell him you failed to protect his daughter, and you inform him of the situation, and you
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   take responsibility, and you don't make her the culprit.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   And you do the same with your parents.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.800]   You own your sin.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.720]   You do what is right.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.880]   This is your mission.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:56.840]   Then you become a listener, because you're going to get clobbered big time by parents,
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   probably.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   Maybe not.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   I don't know.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.440]   Don't know anything about them.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.280]   Don't know if they're believers.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.040]   You need to become a listener, not just to me as a distant counselor who knows very little
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.280]   about the situation or about you or your girlfriend, but a listener to her parents and your parents
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.000]   and your pastor.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.760]   If parents are unbelievers and want you to get an abortion, you tell them in all meekness
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.360]   and strength that you don't support that, and as much as you have any say in it, you
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.800]   won't go there.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.360]   And you give them your best biblical explanation.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.080]   And hopefully when the shock and the initial anger eases, everyone will be able to put
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.960]   their heads together and think through a more just and merciful and hopeful future.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.220]   And another thing that your leadership implies is the realization that your girlfriend will
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.400]   bear the greater weight immediately and practically for this sin, because she must carry this
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.000]   baby now, give birth to the baby, sustain the baby in those early months, and this will
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.400]   be a huge alteration in her life.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.360]   This is why we have so many abortions, because mothers and fathers put their own plans ahead
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.520]   of the life of the child.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:29.920]   As a mature Christian, a man, you will realize your girlfriend's heavy load in all this,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.320]   and you will do everything in your power to lighten her load.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.600]   And killing children doesn't lighten her load.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   It doesn't.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.520]   And you will help her through this because you are the one who bear most responsibility
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:56.480]   for it as a man who didn't own up to your peculiar responsibilities.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:03.600]   With regard to the possibility of marrying each other, I would say don't go there just
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.720]   for the baby's sake.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.560]   I don't know enough about you and your girlfriend to know whether marriage is advisable or not.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.680]   You've only known each other two months, at least when you wrote that question, that was
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.920]   the case.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.560]   That's not enough to go on.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.480]   You need time to know each other and whether a lifetime commitment would be advisable.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.920]   If it turns out that marriage is advisable and your parents approve, that would probably
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.320]   be the best outcome.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:42.320]   But in any case, don't despair because you don't know what the future holds.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.720]   God calls you to faithful, obedient decisions right now.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.000]   He does not assume that you can foresee all the consequences of those choices.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.280]   That's his great work.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.820]   He works everything together for good for those who love God, even when we can't imagine
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.700]   how that could be.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.760]   So what I'm calling you to, William, is dig down deep into the resources of Scripture
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:13.440]   and the Holy Spirit and faith and do the kinds of things that God especially calls a man
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.360]   to do in a crisis like this.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.760]   This will be the hardest season of your life, so far at least.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:30.040]   It will be a huge test of your faith and your manhood, and you will discover that Jesus
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.600]   is a great Savior and a great friend and a sufficient counselor.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Amen.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   Very good.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.400]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that counsel.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.840]   And William, thanks for your willingness to send in such a personal question, putting
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.760]   yourself forward willingly to help so many others out there who are asking that same
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.960]   question or who will ask that same question in the future.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.800]   May the Lord use this episode to reach those couples.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.080]   Remember at our online home, you can explore about 1,300 past episodes, scan a list of
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.200]   our most popular ones, and read full transcripts.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.840]   Even send us a question of your own, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.360]   Well if saving faith means treasuring Christ above all things, how do I know I was really
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.200]   saved when I think I was saved?
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.400]   We get this question quite a lot in the inbox.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   It's a great question.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   It's coming up on Monday.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you on the other side of the weekend.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.580]   Bye.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.580]   [END]
