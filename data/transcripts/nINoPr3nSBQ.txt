[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   All right, so we have another question here from Mel.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.660]   Mel says, "How do I get out of the urgent quadrant for long enough to hire or outsource
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.040]   work and implement productivity systems?"
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.600]   All right, so she elaborates, "I manage my husband's medical practice.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.840]   I am burnt out and cognitively depleted by the volume, time sensitivity, and unrelenting
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.040]   nature of incoming work.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   I spend all my time in the urgent quadrant and in hyperactive hive mind.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.720]   I don't have the option to leave the job.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.120]   I can hire and outsource to some extent when I'm able to make time for it, but how do I
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.320]   get out of the urgent quadrant for long enough to recruit and train staff and to implement
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.600]   sustainable productivity systems?"
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.220]   Mel, I talk about exactly this problem in my book, A World Without Email.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.880]   It is, I describe as an insidious negative feedback loop.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.000]   And here's what happens, and here's what's happening to you, but it's very common.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.680]   When you become too hyperactive with the hyperactive hive mind, so that the sheer quantity of work
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.880]   that you're trying to organize in this very inefficient way with ad hoc, unscheduled back
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.840]   and forth messaging, when that gets to a certain point, you have so little breathing room,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.200]   just trying to keep up with all these unscheduled back and forth messages, that there's no free
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.720]   time or energy to actually put in place the alternative systems that could reduce all
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.760]   of these unscheduled messages, these unscheduled ad hoc messages.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.360]   So when it gets too bad, you strip yourself of the time and energy required to make it
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   better.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960]   So it's an insidious negative feedback cycle.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.800]   And Mel, that's what you're in right now.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.060]   So what's the solution here?
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.300]   You have to temporarily but drastically give yourself some breathing room by dramatically
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.840]   reducing the amount of things that you're trying to coordinate in this inefficient manner.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.920]   So you do these drastic emergency reductions of what's on your plate.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.120]   That gives you breathing room to look at what remains and figure out sustainable systems
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.040]   that don't require you just constantly being on email, constantly being on Slack, constantly
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   checking your phone.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.440]   And then once these systems are in place, then your breathing room gets much bigger
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.560]   because the things that remain have now been, from a cognitive perspective, made much more
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.720]   tractable.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.600]   You're able to add stuff back because now the systems are there, but you have to pull
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.760]   things away and it's going to feel painful.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   It's going to feel weird.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.460]   It's going to feel like you're leaving money on the table.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.640]   You have to do that.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.260]   And then things come back once you have the actual systems in place.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.680]   Now the added benefit of this approach is when you add things back, you maybe don't
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.240]   add back everything.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.520]   Maybe when you're trying to add things back, you say this one type of business we do is
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.600]   not easily tamable by systems to get rid of unscheduled messages.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   It's this particular client or type of work that requires and demands this berating constant
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.180]   communication.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.440]   And now it's really clear, well, that type of work is not compatible with the type of
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   way we want to work.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.240]   Let's not add it back.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.000]   Let's get rid of that type of business.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So it also gives you a chance to clean house as you're thinking about all the different
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   type of business you do.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.480]   So what this means for your husband's medical practice, for example, is cut back on clients,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   cut back on surgeries.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.120]   Like there's going to be a period where you say we're cutting back.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.540]   You're not stepping away from existing things, but you're going to put a hold on bringing
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.540]   on new things for a while.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.540]   You're going to have a six month period where you fall back towards a baseline and make
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.840]   less money and miss out opportunities, but allows you to actually build in better systems,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.440]   hire new staff, train that staff, figure out how to make sure that you are not context
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.240]   shifting every two to three minutes, that you're not constantly email, that you're not
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.720]   constantly on text messaging.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960]   And here's the thing, who cares about six months worth of money?
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   What's the point?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.480]   That's a miserable existence you're talking about.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.200]   And your husband's probably burnt out too, because it bleeds over.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.280]   He has too much work.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   It bleeds over to his practice.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.240]   That's the way you have to do it.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   You have to make a dramatic temporary reduction if you're going to get the breathing room
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.120]   required to build up systems that will be sustainable going forward.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.760]   The money will come back, but with much less stress once those systems are in place.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   So that's what I recommend.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.360]   It's time, Mel, to do something radical.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
