[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.880]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend some time with you today as we encourage
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.640]   one another, learn together, and ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.280]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.100]   Now, whether you're just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.940]   daily delight of family learning, I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.160]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.440]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.780]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.760]   Well, listeners, you may or may not have heard rumbles in the jungle of something new happening
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.120]   with our podcasts.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.440]   And I have here with me today a wonderful friend.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.740]   And I was going to say my guest, Delise, but Delise is not going to be a guest.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.360]   Delise and I are going to be at the helm of an all new Everyday Educator Podcast that is
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.640]   a little bit new and a little bit old, but a perfect blend of all the best of both of us
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.640]   and some great new stuff that we think that you're really going to enjoy.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.620]   Delise, I'm so excited to share the chair with you.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.040]   Well, I am so excited to be here.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.500]   And I know a lot of our listeners know me from Blessings and Motherhood, and I've got a few
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.480]   chances to come over and chat with you on Everyday Educator.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.960]   But I'm excited because we're going to be here all the time.
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.100]   I know.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.060]   And I love that.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.800]   I love the perspective that you bring.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.380]   I love sharing with you.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.160]   Guys, when you are, when Delise is a guest on My Everyday Educator, or I have been a guest
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.860]   on her Blessings and Motherhood, we have way more fun talking than you guys do listening.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.140]   I am just excited that we're going to get to do more of that and share the perspective of
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:26.980]   a mom with children that are on the go and growing and a mom who has watched her girls
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.800]   grow up and now are watching them become moms of their own.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.960]   And so we are going to offer something for everybody from moms with little kids just running
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   around enjoying the exploration of the world and all the way through foundations and essentials
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.780]   and challenge moms who are in the trenches every day doing the very best they can to educate
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.800]   their family and build a family of culture, family culture of learning all the way up to people
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.960]   like me who still really want to make a difference in the lives of children and young families
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.980]   in my community.
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.840]   I'm a grandmother, and that still sort of freaks me out, but it's the best job ever.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.680]   But you know what?
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.780]   I still want to build families up.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.020]   I still want to encourage new moms.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.180]   And I keep thinking, wow, if I could just tell you what I wish somebody had told me a long
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.300]   time ago, maybe that would bless you.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.600]   So I think that's where I'm coming from.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.760]   Well, and you're so right, Lisa, because, you know, we're all learning as we go and that
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   never stops.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.720]   But most of us, I think, are more like me and we don't want to learn the hard way.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:04:01.300]   If I could learn this lesson well and not have as many Band-Aids, I would be okay with that.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.660]   Yes, exactly.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.800]   Well, and sometimes it's just nice.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.500]   It's not that I've learned this lesson and I'm going to teach you.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.380]   Sometimes it's just nice to learn shoulder to shoulder with somebody.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.800]   And it's nice to have a community, even virtually, that you can lock arms with and walk along with
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.140]   and pray for one another and shoot ideas back and forth and have somebody say, no, girl, that's
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.680]   crazy.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.040]   Or, oh, I'm going to try that tonight and I'll let you know how it goes.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.120]   Exactly.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.100]   So I really am excited to nurture.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.560]   We've been calling it a broader conversation of home education together.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.860]   And that also means, you guys, that you're going to hear from me and Lisa regularly, but
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.300]   you'll also hear from a number of other guest hosts who are going to rotate through the panel
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.980]   with us.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.760]   And so we're really excited for you to meet some of our friends and to hear their perspectives
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.260]   on growing their families and the things that they're learning across the way.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.240]   And one of the things we wanted to make sure that we put in this episode was just an overview
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   of why Everyday Educator is called the Everyday Educator.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.420]   Because I think, you know, we're kind of in our silo at this point.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.720]   So we know what we mean by it.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.620]   But maybe you're new.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.640]   And if you are new, we're so happy you're here.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.520]   So maybe you don't know what we mean.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.280]   Maybe you're thinking, is that a daily podcast, a routine of things you do every day?
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.240]   And one of my favorite things I've heard you say, Lisa, is that learning is a lifestyle.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.400]   Yes.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.480]   We have co-opted that phrase and we use it over on the CC YouTube page all the time
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.320]   because I just think it's such a good way to describe what we're trying to accomplish here.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.520]   That it would just be a lifestyle.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.360]   It's not even necessarily something that you have to tell yourself to do.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.140]   It's not a switch that you turn on.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.100]   Okay, let's sit down at the table.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.920]   Since we're at the table, now we're learning.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.820]   And then when we close our books and we're done with school, that's not, that would be
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.460]   That's not real.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.940]   Yeah, that's not real.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.380]   That's not how we live.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.080]   Sometimes the very best lesson, the very best math lessons that I ever taught were when my
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.100]   girls went with me to the grocery store.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.640]   They learned about on sale and percent off and how to figure the tax and will I have enough
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.760]   money when I get to the register.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.480]   And so those were some of the very best lessons.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.960]   And those were not around the table.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.920]   They were around the shopping cart.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.940]   So exactly.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.820]   Learning as you go.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.680]   That's kind of what we mean by everyday educator.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:56.740]   And you're an everyday educator because you are doing something every day to teach your children
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.080]   education, all kinds of things, practical knowledge and academic knowledge.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.580]   You are an everyday educator.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.060]   And it becomes, like you said, just a habit.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.980]   A family culture is what we're trying to establish.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:21.980]   A family culture of learning where your family explores a new idea together and you go and look
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:29.600]   it up, my grandson is constantly asking me, Lolly, what is this part of the front end loader
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.040]   called?
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.160]   I'm just like, son, I mean, I'm thinking to myself, I'm glad I even know it's a front end
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.600]   loader.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.020]   And so I will say to him, because he means, what is that specific part called?
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.140]   And he's not going to forget.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.900]   And so I don't want to make something up.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.200]   And so I'll say, we're going to look it up.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.940]   And so we'll come back in to where the computer or the phone is.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.420]   And he will say, Lolly, look it up.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:02.420]   And so we're everyday educators because as we go through life, as we do our everyday
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.800]   things, we are learning as we go.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:13.200]   And so an everyday educator is somebody who just considers learning an everyday thing to
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.760]   do, like eating breakfast, or maybe you don't eat breakfast, or making your bed, or maybe you
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.320]   don't make your bed.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.580]   An everyday thing to do, like getting dressed, right?
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.660]   Taking out the trash.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.480]   It's an everyday thing.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.800]   It's normal, I guess is what we want to say.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.680]   Exactly.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.440]   It's just natural to you.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.820]   And it's so funny to me hearing you talk about how the best math lessons you ever taught were
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.260]   in the store, because I have so many vivid memories of my mother holding up an item of
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.880]   clothing and saying, you can have this if you can calculate how much it's going to cost
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.500]   with a discount.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.660]   There you go.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.080]   Okay, I got this by shopping.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.840]   I can do this.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:02.360]   Or, or, I mean, I can remember buying fancy wear and saying, okay, cost per wear.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.880]   If you're only going to wear this three times, then it is way too, we're not spending it.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.660]   But if you can tell me how else you will wear this, then we can talk.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.500]   You know, those are good lessons.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.080]   Those are nice lessons.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.980]   And every time, every time it would happen, it was inevitable.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.860]   Someone would pass our cart and say, oh, that's the most important math you need to learn.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.400]   Right.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.900]   So you're right.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.320]   You're right.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.760]   And I know that to be true now.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.300]   And I'm excited too, because we're changing some things.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.600]   You may not know this.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.300]   You may be still listening to the podcast on your favorite podcast platform, which is awesome.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.240]   Please keep doing that.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.860]   Keep subscribing.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.420]   But you may have found us on YouTube.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.020]   So we want to let you know if you didn't already know, or if you've always wanted to see Lisa's
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.600]   smiling, gorgeous face, beautiful library, you know, or just put it on in the background while
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.200]   you're doing dishes.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.020]   That's one of my favorite things to do that now everyday educator is on YouTube.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.260]   It's a video podcast.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.880]   And you can find us over on the classical conversations, YouTube page.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.680]   So this is our capstone podcast right now.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.820]   And then also we are creating a more robust social media presence because while we love talking
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:21.200]   to you, we want to be able to talk with you and to have conversations with you and to hear
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.120]   from you and to interact with you and to answer your questions in real time.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.500]   And so social media is a really great tool for that.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.560]   So if you're not already following us on social media at everyday educator, please go now to
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.880]   your favorite social media platform and do that so that we can say hi to you and keep sharing.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.320]   And then you can also share different tidbits of this podcast with your friends.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:50.760]   We would love to know what everyday educator moment happened in your family or what question
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:56.460]   you have, maybe that was generated by some offhand remark that we made.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:04.340]   Or there may be a real question that you would love to have discussed by moms that you could watch
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.260]   and think, okay, okay, well, there's another perspective.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.840]   So let us know.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.520]   We want to know what is interesting to you.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.560]   Absolutely.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.980]   Well, and you know, Lisa, I know we're going a little bit out of order here, but I'm realizing
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.020]   we're just chatting and we've never introduced ourselves.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.020]   So maybe we don't know.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.300]   I know.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.500]   It's just like, I think that all the people that I know, know each other and they're friends.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.560]   All my friends are already friends, but that's not necessarily so.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.060]   Oh, well, you're right.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.900]   Well, Delise, introduce people to your lovely self.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:36.640]   Okay.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.900]   And then it'll be your turn.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.480]   Okay.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.340]   I am Delise Germond.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.640]   I always like to joke that's germs on you, Germond.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.460]   That's great.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.060]   Very French name.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.640]   And right now I am the mother of a three-year-old.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.440]   And then I have another one on the way.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.040]   Leo is our little precocious guy.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.380]   He is a ton of fun, lots of energy, lots of questions.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.880]   He's riding his bike.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.900]   I mean, this is a high energy kid.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.360]   And we're having a lot of fun.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.740]   And my husband and I live out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.440]   We have been married for, it'll be 10 years by the time you guys hear this conversation.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.120]   So that's fun to have.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.900]   Congratulations.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.940]   That's awesome.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.580]   Yes.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.180]   It's been a very fun ride.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.160]   Evan is an amazing man.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:31.860]   And what has been most exciting for me being married to him is that he actually, he does do
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.620]   the things that he says he's going to do.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.880]   And I know that that sounds perhaps-
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.100]   That's wonderful.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.080]   It has been astounding to me.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.480]   It has been a crazy adventure.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.200]   You know, most of the time people talk and they're just dreaming.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.000]   They're just talking.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.460]   Right.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.540]   That if Evan is talking about something, it's going to happen.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.260]   Yes.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.780]   So he says, you know, we're moving to this place.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.360]   Get ready.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.220]   We're about to move.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.200]   Whatever it is.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.680]   Start the boxes.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.380]   Exactly.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.680]   So that's been a lot of fun.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.500]   And then, of course, I've been in this homeschool community my whole life.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.480]   I'm the third of four children and I was homeschooled classically.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.500]   I was not homeschooled with classical conversations, but my mother was a very big part of, you know,
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.600]   the middle part of creating all of the curriculum with classical conversations and things like
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:19.760]   that.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.600]   So I got a firsthand view of what that looks like.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.580]   And I'm really excited to jump into Scribblers in the fall with my son and to just be able to be a part of
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.320]   foundations through through challenge and beyond.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.780]   Oh, that's so exciting.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.300]   I just love I love hearing stories about Leo.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.620]   I love hearing stories about what you're doing because it brings back memories for me because
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.260]   I'm on the other end of the homeschool journey, as some of you already knew.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.940]   I'm Lisa Bailey.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.660]   I have this is going to be a little shot and it shocks me when I say it out loud.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:01.740]   I have been involved with classical conversations in some manner or other for 21 years.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:11.140]   I joined classical conversations with my daughters when my older daughter was in the fifth grade
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.880]   and my younger daughter was in the second grade and they went through foundations and essentials
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.680]   and both graduated through the challenge program.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:27.100]   And my husband and I were very pleased with the education that our girls got.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.600]   But we were super pleased with the educations that we redeemed.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.760]   Both of us went to a really good college.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.980]   We were Wake Forest graduates and we thought we had a great education and we did.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:50.960]   But there were still pieces of the education that we redeemed as we found the connections
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.520]   and the integrations between the things that we were studying at home with our girls.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.220]   And it was a beautiful ride.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:06.200]   I've tutored Challenge B and Challenge 1 and my husband was a Challenge 1 director.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.560]   And I have been involved in a lot of different things.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:17.860]   Field leadership, construction of practicum materials and training those practicum speakers
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.460]   for years and years.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:26.400]   I was on the team that produced Scribblers that DeLise was mentioning a few minutes ago.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:36.040]   And I still work for Classical Conversations as the director of program development under CCMM now.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:43.240]   And so we are the arm of the company that produces the guides and the curriculum.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.640]   The new books that are written are written by our team.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.060]   And so I'm loving that.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:55.880]   And I have been blessed to be the face of Everyday Educator podcast for a good many years.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.500]   And I have enjoyed it.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.420]   And people say, why do you keep doing this?
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.200]   And I just say, because I'm endlessly curious.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   And I wonder about things.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.000]   And I like to talk to people and find out what they're thinking about things.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.540]   And truthfully, I really have a heart for helping families love to learn together.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:27.740]   And if I can save you from making one of the dumb mistakes that I have made, all the better.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:34.020]   But mostly what I do is just come along beside of you and say, let's learn together.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.360]   And that's what we do.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.320]   I love that.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.200]   And it's such a blessing to have that voice in your ear, you know, that person reminding
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.600]   you why you started this in the middle of that year.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.780]   Yes.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.880]   It's like, okay.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.100]   But remember, I mean, today is not a good day.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.420]   I mean, nobody would say that it was a good day.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.760]   But you did not begin to homeschool just to have good days all the time.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:07.500]   Homeschooled because you wanted to both redeem your own education and offer your children a
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:15.400]   way to know the God of heaven and earth and to make him known, to equip themselves to know
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:23.560]   him and to love him and to understand him more and to be able to pass that knowledge on to somebody
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.860]   else in a winsome, persuasive way.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.920]   And the fact that he keeps on showing up to do that kind of makes you want to show up too.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   Absolutely.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:42.880]   Talking about that right before we started, just the fact that the Lord keeps taking the
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.820]   little bit in our hand and making much of it, you know, and he's not expecting us as homeschoolers
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.940]   or even just as believers to come to the table with everything.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.700]   Right.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.260]   And he's expecting us to trust him, you know, and to watch him work.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.660]   Absolutely.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.900]   Absolutely.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.100]   And even give him room to work.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:08.160]   Take your hand off the controls a little bit and let him do what he's going to do.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.740]   Exactly.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:16.660]   And so I love that, you know, over the years that I've been around homeschool moms, the
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.860]   number one thing I've always heard them say is, you know, what blessed me the most is what
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.640]   God taught me.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.860]   You know, they're never saying, oh, what blessed me the most is that my kid is now.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.720]   Even though they're proud of their children and they're thankful that they did it, the
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.000]   Lord meets you, you know, on the path.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.520]   The Lord meets you in the journey.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.100]   And that's encouraging.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:43.500]   And I'm glad that this is a place where we can amplify that truth for families.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:49.160]   And so, you know, as we're rounding the bend on this conversation and just welcoming all of
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:56.220]   our new listeners and all of our old listeners to the party, we do want to reassure you that there
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.420]   are so many things about the Everyday Educator podcast that you love that are going to be the
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.700]   same.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.420]   Right.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:02.760]   Absolutely.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.780]   You're still going to hear about classical Christian education.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.000]   We are still going to give you the ins and outs of mock trial and different specifics that
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.280]   you need for the curriculum.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.340]   We're going to talk about the curriculum.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:22.460]   Yeah, we're going to talk about the seasons of a homeschool mom and family's year.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.680]   We're going to talk about all of that stuff, too.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.700]   Exactly.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.860]   And we do want to continue to hear from you.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.900]   And so if there are ever needs or questions that you have, we're going to start having episodes
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.280]   like that where we just answer questions.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.960]   And so please keep your eye out on social media as we're on this journey with you.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.720]   Please feel free to reach out to us.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.780]   We are listening and we will do our best to respond in a timely way.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:54.300]   We are so excited to keep pondering the delights and challenges together.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.160]   I love it.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.840]   I love it.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.180]   I love it that we can change and stay the same.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:07.900]   Because years ago, some of you may have been part of a CC community enough to know that we
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:16.240]   used to offer webinars and people had to log into their computer and it was like an hour or an hour
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.740]   and a half.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.820]   And so we figured out, but it was real time.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.480]   You logged in for that certain time.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.880]   And, you know, people began to that.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.240]   That is just really doesn't meet my need or it's not the rhythm of my family's life.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.980]   So we went to podcasting.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.160]   So this is just the next evolution.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.660]   So it's going to be not just in your ear, but on your screen.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:50.160]   And so we're doing the same thing of encouraging and inspiring and equipping families to do the
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.460]   work God's called them to do in homeschooling just in a different way.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.200]   And we can't wait to walk with you, honestly, on that journey.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.080]   So thank you all for listening.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:07.520]   If you've enjoyed this podcast, we would love for you to rate and leave a review for the show.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.900]   Anywhere that you listen to podcasts, you can give a five-star review.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.960]   And rating it actually helps other people to find out about the show.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.980]   It triggers that algorithm that we all hear about all the time.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.260]   So we're so grateful that you're with us.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:26.900]   And before we let you all go, we do want to encourage you all to participate in the Classical
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.020]   Learning Cohort.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.360]   If you don't know what the Classical Learning Cohort is, it is comprised of small groups of
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.280]   CC parents who are learning how to become more confident, competent classical teachers.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.160]   And I don't know about you, but that is definitely something that I need.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.280]   I need help with the confidence and the competence in being a classical educator.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:53.620]   So the CLC provides a place of mentorship while also helping you to practice the skills and
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.280]   hospitable assessment.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.020]   Lisa, have you participated in the CLC?
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.000]   The CLC is awesome.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.200]   It is a great way for you to get your feet wet and to get some practical tips.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.480]   And it's not just you listening.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:15.760]   You will actually practice how to give a great exordium, a great welcome or a hook to a lesson.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.640]   And how to teach it by asking good questions.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:27.820]   And then how to help your student learn how to assess himself or herself by asking, what
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.680]   did I learn?
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.280]   How did I get better at this?
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.760]   What did I do well?
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.860]   What can I improve next time?
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.300]   And so you have a mentor, but also classmates.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.260]   You have a small group that stays the same.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.380]   So you get to know one another.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.560]   And it's iron sharpening iron.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:56.340]   It is a beautiful way for you as a parent to grow as a classical educator and continue to
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.120]   be a lifelong learner alongside your kids.
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.580]   It is so great.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.640]   And I've only heard good things about the CLC.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   Right now, we actually also offer a free online event.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.660]   So maybe you want to try it out and see what it would be like to be a part of the CLC.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.100]   You can do that with a CLC mentor.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.260]   You just need to go to classicalconversations.com forward slash cohort.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.800]   And then you'll search for experience the CLC to find an event that fits your schedule.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.120]   And that'll be great.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.120]   And I will tell you, they have groups that are opening up at different times of the year.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.320]   So if you think, oh, but I don't want to do it now.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.200]   We're just going into the summer and I have XYZ planned.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.540]   There are fall cohorts that you can register for now.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.760]   So find out, make your plan and have something to be excited about.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.300]   Well, guys, thank you for listening to the show.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.580]   Again, we'd love to see you over on social media and we hope you'll bring a friend next
