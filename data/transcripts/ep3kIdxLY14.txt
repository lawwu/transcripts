[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   First, how can somebody be long AI but hedge for the possibility that Taiwan will be invaded?
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.080]   So yeah, you know, you want to I don't know if I should put money into TSMC, but I know
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.640]   that GPUs are going to be the next big thing, or are we going to be very important in the
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.640]   future?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.880]   How do you make that position concrete?
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.520]   Oh, man, that's really hard.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.120]   Like, I guess the next best thing would be looking at the Korean fabs because they are
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.080]   they're close, but I guess they don't produce the same chips.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   But I guess, I guess the bet would be that Korea is the country most likely to catch
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.160]   up to Taiwan, in the event that we're mostly going to catch up to where Taiwan is today
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.720]   if Taiwan is no longer an option.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.240]   But I think like if you're betting if you're trying to make the AI bet conditional on Taiwan
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.280]   bet, I think a lot of what you want to do is actually think about how you underwrite
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.000]   the Taiwan invasion bet because that's probably the thing with the bigger...
