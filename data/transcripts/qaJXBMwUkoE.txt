[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   A few logistical things.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.280]   One, I'm carrying a magic trackpad because everyone has clickers.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.280]   What if we had multiple dimensions?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.280]   We're going to experiment with this today.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.560]   And two, I'm using AI, like fancy new everything, right?
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.420]   So this is Tome, and we're going to go two-dimensional with our slides as well.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.720]   So I'm here to talk about the AI engineer.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.260]   You're all here because you believe that there's some value to this idea.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.520]   And then I just put like a ridiculous 1000x on this.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.520]   But I do think there is some meaning towards thinking about higher orders of magnitude towards
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.560]   raising your ambitions.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.240]   And that's what I would like all of you to do today and to do with your friends back home.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.120]   So and obviously a lot of AI-generated art because, I mean, it's an AI conference.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   We've got to do it.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.920]   We've got to do that.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.980]   First of all, I want to congratulate you on being here.
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.880]   I'm not talking about here location-wise, physically.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.820]   I'm talking about here in terms of the point in time.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.080]   Imagine if you were a mathematician.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.980]   When was the best time to be born?
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:23.740]   I would propose around about 600 AD, this dude, Brahma Gupta, he invented zero.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.180]   Pretty novel invention that took us only 4000 years to do that.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.280]   But there's certain times where if you're in that field, you have to be there.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   That's the thing.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   When was the best time to be born?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   There's a right answer.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   1905, 1927.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   And this conference kind of is inspired by the Solvay Conference.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.140]   That's Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and a lot of people that you just saw in the Oppenheimer
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.140]   movie.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.140]   Same thing.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.560]   If you made cars, there was a right time, 1900 to 1930.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.200]   If you made personal computing products, 1980 to 2010.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.020]   If you're a millennial, if you're very online, you ever get these memes like you're born too
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.540]   late to explore the earth, born too early to explore the stars, you're not too late.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.900]   We are here.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.580]   This is based on demographics and history, the approximate timeline of all of humanity.
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.820]   We know that we're roughly about 73% of all concurrent intelligences if we don't expand
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.200]   our own intelligences or go to other planets.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.060]   So my argument and my message to you today is that you are just in time, and the timing
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.080]   is right to 1000x.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.480]   I think a lot of my technology and industrial organization thinking is informed by Carlotta
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.780]   Perez, one of the most influential thinkers on tech revolutions.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.460]   She wrote this book about the installation and deployment periods of tech cycles.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.020]   And we're definitely going through one today.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.620]   A lot of you on your mind here, I know you're here, but also mentally you're back home thinking,
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.600]   how much of this is a fad?
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.740]   How much of this is Web 3 again?
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.020]   And we've seen this over and over.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.320]   the historians greater than us have explored this over the industrial revolution, the age
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.860]   of railways, age of heavy engineering and steel, oil, and most recently the tech revolution.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.260]   Funny enough, they all roughly span between 50 and 70 years, and if you're around in that
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.460]   time, that's the field to be pursuing.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.940]   So when did the AI revolution start?
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.940]   We're very lucky.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.820]   It's very hard historically to place a start point on something that changes human civilization.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.820]   We have a moment, 2012, AlexNet.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.920]   We're roughly 10 years on.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.020]   And we can put numbers to it, right?
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.080]   So most of the time these curves are sort of theoretical.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.960]   They're just kind of like, bleh, like y-axis is just bleh.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.820]   Here we can actually just put the amount of compute we're using towards training in models.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.460]   There's a huge inflection, that's AlexNet, right on the blue dot over there.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.100]   That's a huge inflection where we realized, gradually realized, it took too long to realize,
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.700]   but scale is starting to work.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.740]   And if you actually take this out, a lot of people have been taking this out, and I want
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.560]   you to take scaling seriously.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.200]   There's three reasons why six is a magic number.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.560]   There's a very famous investor who I shall not name, and says, "Imagine roughly 690
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.140]   in moral compute by the end of the decade and plan for that."
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.080]   So there is more of this coming, linear projection-wise, and you can plan on a lot more investment
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.020]   in language models.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.600]   John Carmack says there's six key insights towards AGI.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.040]   And lastly, George Hotz has these really nice analogies.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   GPT-3 took about one-person year of compute.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.440]   GPT-4 took about 100-person years of compute.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.380]   You stretched it out to GPT-10, the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-10, again under the six-fold
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.200]   increments in GPT advancements.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.840]   And that would be more compute than the equivalent compute of every human ever who ever lived.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.960]   So just being in the right moment, you will get to live on top of these mega, mega trends
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.380]   that is greater than any single one of us.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.320]   And I think you're all here thinking about the AI engineer.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.140]   And I put it in a very, very small sort of local context of, hey, what's the org chart?
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.080]   Where do the ML engineers sit, where the ML researchers sit, where the software engineers sit?
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   And what's the gap that's opening?
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.900]   It's the AI engineer.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.900]   It's very much of a demand and supply argument.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.400]   There's something like 100,000 card-carrying data science machine learning engineers.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   And GitHub claims to have 100 million registered developers.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.180]   I don't know what the real number is.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.940]   You can debate 40 to 50 million to 100 million.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.420]   It's orders of magnitude more.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.520]   So we think there's going to be much more AI engineers than ML engineers.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.860]   There's all these reasons why.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   Same reasons that I mentioned in the blog post that you've all read.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.100]   And also, why engineering and not just prompting is because LLMs themselves are not AGIs yet.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.840]   We actually have to coordinate them in systems of software.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.660]   We have to write code around them and orchestrate them with code in order to do something useful.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.280]   And we already know how to do code.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.160]   So I want to spread it out a little bit more.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.460]   I think that the conversation on AI engineer has a vague discrepancy.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.540]   And I want to basically split it out into three areas of AI engineer.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.140]   Software engineer enhanced by AI tooling, like Co-Pilot.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.800]   Software engineer building AI products, like Mid-Journey.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.560]   AI product that replaces human engineer, potentially like Auto GBT and maybe Replica Ghost Rider.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.120]   So let's give these guys a name.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.620]   And in case you're wondering, enhanced by versus replaces, I think about it very much like the
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.620]   self-driving car terms.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620]   Like level two, level three.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.120]   There's a difference between whether humans in the loop were there or humans as to fall back.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.000]   So let's name it, three major types of AI engineer.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.020]   The AI enhanced engineer for people who are enhanced by AI.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.900]   People who build AI products, AI products engineer.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.780]   And then the AI engineer agents who is not human.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.320]   And naturally, of course, if you're interested in sort of progressing up the career ladder,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.380]   AI enhanced engineer, then product engineer and engineering agent.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.280]   So this talk was really inspired by actually Amjad, who is speaking next, where he did a recent
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   talk with the XTNCD podcast, and Sam Altman, who actually sees 1,000 X engineers in OpenAI
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   every day.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.620]   And it's really a set of stackable 10 by 10 by 10 improvements.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.320]   Over the course of the next two days, I think you'll be seeing a lot of the speakers will
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.260]   be working on different parts of this stack.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.000]   So I really encourage you to think about where in your life this AI movement can improve
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.440]   and increase your productivity.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.720]   I'm very, very honored to have drawn from all over the world the leading eight lights of the
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.040]   AI engineering movement.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.200]   We are a very small room today.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.940]   I do think we can 100 and 1,000 X from here.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.040]   And it's not just about tools and speakers, it's also about you.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.240]   So I highly encourage you to take part in all the opportunities that we have for you to
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.980]   mix and mingle with each other, with the speakers and with the sponsors as well.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.980]   So there's that.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:15.720]   The final word I do want to offer you is effectively what I think, in terms of non-technical
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.320]   terms, the 1,000 X engineer could offer.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.720]   My favorite advice for what a 10X engineer could look like is an engineer that teaches 10 other
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   people what they know.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.460]   networks, that's not a technical term, but it is very useful.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.460]   And there's all these scaling laws for networks, which I really keep in mind.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:41.200]   So you can go from O of N to O of N squared to O to the power of N. But really what O of N
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.940]   is, is you attending all the talks and consume all the content and letting people in with
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.940]   your Pac-Man rule.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.940]   O and Squared is helping others learn.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.940]   My very first blog post was at exactly a conference like this where I was encouraged to write something.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.940]   And of course it was on machine learning.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:03.100]   And finally going home and then building your own networks of AI engineers and helping to
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.100]   grow networks of learning as well.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.220]   So I hope you take that with you in your AI engineer journey.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.820]   I hope that over the next few days you get a sense of what it's like to be at the start
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.120]   of an industry.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.680]   And I'm just glad to be here with you.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.260]   Thanks so much.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.260]   Thank you.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.080]   I'll see you next time.
