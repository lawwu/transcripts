[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   [Music]
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.000]   "Gottes Ehre ist dort am größten, wo unsere Zufriedenheit in ihm am größten ist."
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.500]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.200]   That's what you just heard in German from our friend Alex.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.800]   Alex is bringing Desiring God's Resources to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   It's an amazing reach.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.100]   And you'll hear what he's working on here in just a moment.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.400]   But first, on to this day after Christmas.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.900]   Pastor John, we have a question from Hope, a listener who wants to know
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.800]   how we should get praised rightly.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   It's a great question. Here it is. Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.600]   My question focuses on my struggle with needing to feel important by those in my church body.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.400]   The Bible teaches that we should seek approval from God, not from man.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.300]   That's Galatians 1.10.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300]   It also teaches that we should encourage one another in spirit, 1 Thessalonians 5.11,
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.500]   and praise those who fear the Lord, that's Proverbs 31.30.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.100]   I feel a strong desire within myself to hear words of affirmation from my ministry
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.800]   to feel loved, valued, regarded, and needed.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.000]   But these desires don't feel holy.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.500]   It feels like a need to be seen rather than humbly giving Jesus a spotlight.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.400]   How do I begin to put to death my need for recognition and cultivate a spirit of humble servitude?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.100]   Can we distinguish between need for man's approval and desiring brotherly encouragement?
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.100]   Pastor John, what would you say to Hope?
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.400]   One of the benefits of this question is that it gives us a chance to lay out some of the paradoxes
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.500]   of Scripture that people sometimes stumble over, which I think is what's happening
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000]   in this question.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.300]   And then I think we can see a single key that I think goes a long way to navigating these paradoxes
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.800]   without being double-minded or contradicting ourselves.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.300]   So here are four of the paradoxes I'm talking about, and what I mean by paradox,
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.900]   in case anybody wonders, "What are you talking about, paradox?"
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.700]   What I mean by paradox is that two things—in this case, two things in the Bible—sound
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.100]   like they don't fit together, like they might be contradictory, but they really aren't
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.100]   contradictory.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.300]   They really do fit together if we just had the key to unlock the pathway that honors
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.700]   both sides of the paradox.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.100]   So here's four examples quickly from the Bible.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.700]   First, "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.300]   them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.700]   Paradox on the other side, Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine that others may see your
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.100]   good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   Shall we want to be seen or not want to be seen?
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.500]   Number two, Galatians 1:10, "Am I now seeking the approval of man or of God, or am I trying
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   to please man?
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.100]   If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.700]   1 Corinthians 10:33, "I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.900]   but that of many that they may be saved."
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.100]   Well, Paul, do we try to please people or do we not care about pleasing people?
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.700]   Number three, Proverbs 22:1, "A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.900]   and favor is better than silver or gold."
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.100]   Or Luke 6:26, "Woe to you when people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100]   prophets."
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.700]   Well, do we seek a good reputation or should we beware of it?
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:18.900]   Number four, Proverbs 31:30, "A woman who fears the Lord is to be praised by people."
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.780]   Romans 2:29, "A true Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.380]   by the Spirit, not the letter.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.100]   His praise is not from people but from God."
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.980]   Well, should we be glad when we're praised by man or should we consider that a dangerous
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.980]   sign?
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.980]   So here they are again, these four paradoxes, and we're trying to steer a way through them
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.980]   that honors the intention on both sides.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.700]   One, desiring that your good works be seen or desiring that they not be seen.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.100]   Two, aiming to please people or indifference to pleasing people.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.700]   Three, desiring a good reputation or being indifferent to our reputation.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.820]   Glad when we are praised for some good or concerned that that gladness might be a signal
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.140]   of sin in us.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.420]   Now, I think there is a key to navigating these paradoxes, a key that keeps us from
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.020]   rejecting the truth of either side of the paradox.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:34.220]   And that key is experiencing such a change of our natural pride and selfishness that
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:45.540]   God himself, all that he is for us in Christ, that God himself becomes our supremely enjoyed,
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.580]   supremely treasured Savior, King, and Shepherd, and Father, and Friend.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.540]   Or to say it another way, when God is treasured more than the sinful possibilities of either
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:09.420]   side of these paradoxes, we will be protected from that sin and led in the right use of
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.980]   both sides of the paradoxes.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:21.380]   For example, if God is supremely satisfying to us, then we won't crave the ego satisfaction
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.340]   of being seen for our good works.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.980]   God is our greatest reward, not the praise of man.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:37.700]   And if we think rightly that some good deed should be seen by others, then that will be
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:46.220]   motivated not for our praise, but so that others can see that these deeds flowed from
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.820]   a heart satisfied in God.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.420]   God will be glorified because we were so satisfied in him that the joy of knowing him overflowed
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.420]   in generosity.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.220]   That's spelled out in 2 Corinthians 8 verse 2.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.580]   Or what about pleasing people?
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.500]   Paul said he doesn't do it, and he said he does do it.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.540]   Now, I think what he means is this.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.260]   When people-pleasing is a way of manipulating a situation to satisfy your craving for human
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:25.260]   approval, you're sending a message that God is not your treasure, human approval is your
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.260]   treasure.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.180]   That's the message you send.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:36.020]   But on the other hand, if you go through life or pursue your ministry thumbing your nose
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:42.820]   at other people's feelings and hopes and expectations with no concern at all about how other people
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.200]   may be offended by what you do or say or how many unnecessary stumbling blocks you put
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:55.140]   in the way of the gospel, then you're sending the message that it's not God's mercy and
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:01.860]   patience that has satisfied your soul, making you eager to win people rather than push people
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.860]   away.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.180]   You're just on an ego trip of exalting yourself.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:13.860]   God is not in you creating the loving desire to draw people into the sweetness of your
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.260]   walk with him.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:24.920]   Or what about caring about a good reputation or the danger of others speaking well of us?
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.520]   If we are living to magnify the worth of God by being satisfied in him, then we will sense
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:40.500]   the difference between wanting a good reputation for ego gratification or for getting rich
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:48.880]   versus a good reputation for the sake of showing the all-sufficiency of God in our lives.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.300]   We will sense the difference between cowardly avoidance of people's criticism on the one
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:02.420]   hand and courageous willingness to live and speak in a way that brings down their approach
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.960]   of unbelievers on the other hand.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.900]   And the key in both cases will be the condition of our own hearts.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:19.660]   Is God the supreme treasure, or am I just pushing him aside because of how good it feels
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:26.820]   to have a good reputation and less criticism because of my biblical Christian?
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:34.860]   And finally, what about receiving worthy praise, like the woman in Proverbs 31 who fears the
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:43.740]   Lord versus living for the praise of man rather than the praise of God in Romans 2.29?
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.260]   And I think the key again is this.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:54.880]   When it says she fears the Lord, what that means is that she fears treasuring anything
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.460]   in this world more than God.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:05.580]   God has become her greatest treasure, her greatest joy, and the only fearful thing in
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:14.200]   the presence of such a God is insulting him by treasuring anything above him.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:22.940]   So when the woman is praised for her fear of God, it's God who's being praised, God
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.340]   himself who is praised overall.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.300]   That's not something to be rejected.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:40.340]   The difference between that and Romans 2.29 is that Romans 2.29 underlines the fact that
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:46.780]   if there's something in us that is praiseworthy about God, what matters most is that God see
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:54.140]   it and that God approve of it, not that man see it and approve of it.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:03.660]   Above all, we want God to be pleased that he is supremely pleasing to us.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.980]   If man finds this worthy of praise, so be it.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:14.760]   That's good, but it is quite secondary to God's approval.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:23.480]   So my answer to the question we were asked, "How do I put to death my need for recognition
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.660]   and cultivate a spirit of humble servitude?" is this.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:37.900]   Devote the rest of your life to knowing God and all that he is for you in Christ, and
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.580]   seek to be supremely satisfied in him.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.580]   Amen.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.900]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.660]   This conversation is relevant to social media, too.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.220]   It reminds me of an episode we did on Instagramming our Good Works, APJ 1151.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.140]   You can find that in the archive.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.660]   APJ 1151, good stuff.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:03.340]   Well, it takes a team to bring Desiring God resources to the world and to reach non-English
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.320]   speakers, and that includes Alex laboring in the German-speaking world.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.720]   You heard his voice at the very top of this episode, and we asked him for an update on
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   his work.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.460]   Here's what he shared.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.020]   My name is Alex Reindl, and I am from Austria.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:23.580]   I'm with Evangelium 21, which is a gospel network for the German-speaking world, for
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.460]   Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.860]   And our aim, our mission is to strengthen the local church, and we do that by setting
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.580]   up conferences, teaching, and by running a website.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:41.300]   And the second thing I'm involved in is Verbum Median, which is a publisher that is also
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   focusing on strengthening the local church through publishing books, e-books, and audio
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.360]   books.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.980]   So the most unique thing I would say about the Desiring God resources that we have, and
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:59.660]   what I really, we really appreciate about the emphasis is that the Christian endeavor
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.640]   is supposed to be a joyful one.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.820]   And for many German-speaking Christians, Christian walk and a Christian faith would rather be
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:15.580]   something with a grinchy, grumpy face, something that we just have to run through and fight
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   through it.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.340]   And we understand that's part of it.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.420]   It is not a, you know, very romantic walking on the beach kind of thing.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:29.020]   But what is so clear in Scripture, and John Piper and Desiring God have been made so clear,
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.620]   is that God is aiming at our heart to be joyful in Him.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.020]   And we loved it.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.860]   And that has been super helpful for our context.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:45.620]   The folks at Desiring God have been so encouraging in helping us grow for the German-speaking
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.260]   market and language.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:52.140]   So we always feel appreciated and strengthened in what we do.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:59.500]   And they come along that endeavor and just not try to push anything onto us or push any
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.500]   agenda.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.460]   They are trying to be super helpful.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.460]   And also on a very personal level, I've experienced a lot of coaching and mentoring over the last
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:15.980]   few years, just on, you know, how to approach things, how to be patient in many aspects,
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:21.820]   where there is a small market, a very small number of Christians, and you need to be patient.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.460]   And Desiring God guys have been, few names come to mind that have been so involved in
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.060]   our lives, in my life, and I'm super grateful for.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:37.660]   You look at, if the numbers are correct, maybe 2% evangelicals in Germany, about 3 to 4%
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:45.780]   in Switzerland, and less than 0.5% in Austria, which is heartbreaking for somebody who lives
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.220]   there and serves there.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:53.820]   And we are praying that the upcoming years would be a time where God uses us and many
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:00.700]   others to bring forward the new Reformation, to do what God has done 500 years ago, to
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:07.500]   gather people around His Word and just bring glory to Himself by a growing and healthy
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.500]   church.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.740]   And we are excited about what's to come, and so thankful for the opportunities we have
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.740]   to serve together.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:22.540]   So, one of the things that amazes me is the fact that we are part of a global gospel movement,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.780]   and that so many people can be a part of it by doing what we do, what I do, or by joining
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.020]   the mission, by supporting, by giving, by praying.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.900]   And I am so thankful for you who is joining that endeavor.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.300]   So thank you for being a part of what we do in the German-speaking world and so many others
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.660]   all over the globe.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   A new Reformation.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.660]   Amen.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.900]   Thank you, Alex, for your faithful labors in this direction and with this hope.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.220]   If you're already a ministry partner with Desiring God, you're in this global gospel
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.140]   movement already, making possible everything that you just heard about.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.620]   And so thank you for your partnership and the fruit of it that we heard about today.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:10.140]   And if you're not yet a partner and you want to join in what's happening through Desiring
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.960]   God in the English-speaking world and how that overflows into Alex's world to reach
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.820]   the German-speaking world, you can join us today.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.380]   Become a monthly ministry partner with us.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:27.020]   Much of our financial support comes from friends of ours who give, on average, $30 a month
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.900]   to support all this work.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.820]   To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.140]   That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.900]   Hugely appreciated on behalf of all of us at Desiring God.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.020]   And Pastor John, thank you for your support and partnership.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.180]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:48.680]   [END]
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   1.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   Desiring God
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.740]   you
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.800]   you
