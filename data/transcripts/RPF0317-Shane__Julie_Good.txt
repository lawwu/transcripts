[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I have a fun and lighthearted
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.200]   adventure story for you.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.280]   Here's the question.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280]   Do you have kids?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.160]   I do.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.440]   Sometimes it's easy as parents to think that kids mean the end of adventures.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.960]   After all, it would have been so easy if my wife and I had gone and backpacked
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.600]   to the world when it's just the two of us, right?
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.080]   Well, how do you do it with kids?
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:47.120]   Today, my guests on today's show have seven kids and they live part time in a
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.600]   converted school bus with their seven kids.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.640]   And they live the other part of the time in a tiny house with their seven kids.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.760]   And they've cobbled together this fascinating and flexible and mobile
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.240]   lifestyle that I think you'll find fun and inspirational.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:27.520]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.760]   I am your host, your fearless leader in the pursuit of the good life today,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.120]   while also building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.360]   Today, we're going to talk about living the good life and financial freedom.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   Frankly, I don't know what to say about this interview.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.240]   I just said it all.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.040]   I think you're going to enjoy this because it's inspirational to see how life is
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.760]   just more fun and financial freedom is more fun when you incorporate family into it.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.360]   I'm not usually caught flat footed with something to say there.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.520]   The music trudges on, but today that's the case.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.400]   But my guests today are Shane and Julie Good.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.280]   They have a website called goodnewsbus.com.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.800]   I found them from surfing around a tiny house website.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.400]   I, like many people have a fascination with this tiny house thing and I found
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.040]   their bus and it was just a beautiful bus.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.560]   And then I figured out they have seven kids in this bus.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.120]   And I just said, man, this is perfect fodder for radical personal finance.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   We talk about their story.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.760]   We talk about the conversion.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.200]   We talk about just what their lifestyle, they built together this lifestyle that
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   is really, really flexible and gives them a lot of freedom while still providing
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.720]   for their needs.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.120]   And they've got a lot of tips and tricks and tactics to share.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.520]   And I think it's very, very valuable to see, you know, many of us think, oh, I've
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.480]   got to be old and rich to live the good life.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.760]   Well, that may not be the case.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   You might be able to do it even when you have seven young children to care for and
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.720]   provide for.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.240]   So I think you're really going to enjoy today's interview.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.640]   One sponsor for today's show before I play the interview for you.

[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.080]   Shane and Julie, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.800]   Hey, great to be here.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.040]   Hi, thanks for having us.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.320]   So I stumbled across your bus on some, I think it was a tiny houses forum.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.280]   And I've always loved these, what do they call them, schooly conversions, right?
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.480]   Is that the right nomenclature?
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.800]   Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.520]   So I've always thought these things are awesome.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.080]   And if it weren't for the fact that I'm six foot six and I can't fit inside of a bus,
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.800]   so I don't think it's the right route for me, I would probably do something similar to
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.160]   what you guys have done, which is take an old school bus and just convert it into just
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.480]   an awesome RV.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.040]   And looking at your website, I thought it seemed like you guys have an interesting
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.520]   lifestyle at least, a little bit unusual.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.280]   And I thought it'd be fun to have you on and see what you've learned.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.880]   So how did you wind up in the situation where you decided it was a good idea to take an
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.080]   old school bus and transform it into a house for you and all your kids?
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.800]   Well, this probably started back when I was about five years old, believe it or not.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.840]   My parents, I was born in Washington State, Seattle, and my parents were looking to move
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.600]   down to the Pensacola, Florida area.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.160]   My mom's family, she's from Washington State.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.760]   My dad's family's from Florida.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.120]   So they've kind of done this back and forth thing.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.960]   So they looked into the cost of getting a U-Haul and driving it all the way down there.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.200]   And after calculating the cost, I think it was my dad was thinking, "Well, shoot, why
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.360]   don't we just buy an old school bus?
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:46.000]   Put a divider about halfway back, pack all of their belongings in the back half of the
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.160]   bus. It's just me and my sister and my mom and my dad.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.600]   And put a set of bunk beds in, a little Coleman stove, and hey, we'll camp on the way as
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   we're moving." And so that was kind of the very beginning of, as far as remembering back
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.320]   and kind of the excitement surrounding, I don't know what it is about a bus, all getting
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.560]   in a bus and you have your bed in the bus and it feels like camping on the road.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.360]   Personalizing it too.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.240]   Yeah. And the ability to personalize it to what fits your lifestyle the best.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800]   So that's kind of where it started.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.280]   And so we used that same bus to move, I think it was three or four times.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.640]   We moved down south, then we moved back up.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.040]   I'm making this really short, back up north.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.000]   And then when we went to move back down south again, this is about when I was, I think,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.920]   15.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   This would have been like in 1994, 93, something like that.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.960]   The bus, as we were leaving, we'd gone through, we were in eastern Washington and we
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.360]   were in a town called Pasco, Washington, and the bus broke down.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.440]   And my dad at that point, it was going to be $5,000 to fix.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.760]   It needed a rebuilt engine or something like that.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:25.080]   And me and my sister, we could not fathom the thought of losing the bus because it
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.680]   just became a part of the family.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.640]   And so we begged my dad, don't do this, don't send her to the scrapyard.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:42.480]   So my dad actually, after appealing to his sentimental side, we convinced him to keep
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.880]   the bus and to get it fixed.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.160]   So we actually lived in Pasco, Washington for about, I don't know, it took about a
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.960]   month, I think it was, to get the bus fixed.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.920]   And then after that, after it was fixed, we brought it all the way down, back down to
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.600]   the Pensacola area.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.480]   And then that's where it sat till years and years later when some guy came and picked
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.000]   it up.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.240]   So my dad forked out all that money.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.560]   Here we are on a finance show, all this cash for something that's just going to sit
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.080]   there.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.720]   But it was for his kids, I guess.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.960]   He knew how we felt and we just we had so much fun and memories traveling in the bus.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.160]   So that's kind of where all of that started.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.720]   I was just going to say, we'll just call that an investment into the love with your
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.520]   family, that your kids know that you love them because you listen to them.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.960]   Right, exactly.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.160]   Now, the remarkable thing is that you not only travel with you and your wife, because
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.280]   that's relatively easy, but you guys are traveling in this thing with seven kids.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.800]   Is that right?
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.480]   Yes.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.000]   Yes.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.120]   Seven children ranging from the ages 13 to one.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   So down.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.400]   So that is awesome because it's really hard to find.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.200]   I mean, maybe that's a little bit of an overstatement.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.960]   Most RVs are not tuned to fit nine people and sleep comfortably.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.320]   So when you get to the place where you have seven kids plus two parents, is that why you
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.960]   guys chose to make this custom design?
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.600]   Yeah, that's definitely one of the reasons.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.400]   When it came time for us, because my wife and I, we do ministry work and the house we
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.480]   are living in was owned by the ministry that we are working for.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.240]   And so when they sold it, they basically said, look, we'll, because we do basically
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.320]   volunteer work for them.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.400]   And they were like, look, we'll invest into helping you guys get to where you need to
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.160]   go and traveling around and continuing doing the, we do ministry work.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.880]   We do music ministry and different things like that, outreach ministries and stuff.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:59.320]   And so we were able to, and that's one of the questions we actually get a lot is, why
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.120]   didn't you guys just go buy an RV?
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.200]   I mean, you certainly could go find an RV.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.640]   And really it's basically what you touched on that we have a large family.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.520]   We didn't have as many kids then, but we kind of knew where the trend was going.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.240]   The school bus idea was kind of planted in Shane's heart since he was young.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.200]   So I'm like, Hey, let's, let's get it.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.720]   Let's find a school bus and let's convert it.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.360]   But we took it up a notch.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.480]   We didn't just put a sofa and a Coleman stove in and some bunk beds.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.240]   We really wanted to make it a place that we could live for a long period of time.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.160]   If we were going to be say building another house or traveling a lot, whatever we were
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.700]   going to be doing, we wanted to be comfortable while we were living there.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.960]   We have lived in it for up to eight months.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   So yeah, having it built the way it is, and I'm sure you've seen pictures and maybe our
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   video.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   So yeah, it's important.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.160]   So spread out over the time of about, I think three years, we are sorry, about five and
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.920]   a half years now.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.320]   We've lived in it probably a total of three years.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.920]   And that, you know, well, I do, I do carpentry work as well.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.360]   And so, you know, if we built a house and are selling it, we'll move back to the bus
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.680]   and we'll live in the bus while we're building a house.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.720]   Or, you know, if we're on a trip or traveling, you know, we'll live in the bus.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.800]   So yeah, it, it, it actually has made things a lot more convenient because we always in
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.600]   a sense have a fallback.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.800]   You know, we always have a house we can fall back on.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.320]   It's our, it's our own little home.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.160]   It's small, but you know, it's got everything we need.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   And we didn't have to, you know, take out a loan to build it.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840]   We built it cash.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   We just, you know, so it's something that is just ours.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.920]   We don't have to have, I guess the extra fees and mortgages and that you would have on a
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.240]   house and yeah.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:06.200]   One of the, one of the, I guess, major benefits I see of, of it, I would love to see, and
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.840]   I want to move to your tiny house as well, but I'd love to see most young people start
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.120]   their life with a tiny house and a trailer, one of the houses that's built on a trailer.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.640]   Because if you can start with your own dwelling place, that's small enough to go on a trailer
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.000]   and you can just hook it up to your truck or have somebody truck it for you.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.320]   And you can know that you always have that as a fallback plan.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.120]   You can always park it in somebody's driveway or in somebody's backyard.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.600]   It provides a sense of security and a sense of safety for you.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.480]   And I think a lot of people are looking for that sense of security and they find it difficult
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.640]   to find.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.520]   But if you have a little cozy place to live that doesn't have any ongoing monthly payments
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.680]   associated with it, that can be really, really powerful.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:59.320]   The funny thing about it is that our son Ashton, he's 10 and he's already dreamed up these
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.040]   ideas of he wants to have a restaurant.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:08.680]   And so he wants to do it in a tiny home and do one of those, I guess you'd call them tumbleweed
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.760]   style houses, but make it a little restaurant and travel around.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   So tell me about the tiny house and let's define because a podcast is an audio only
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   format.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.520]   So let's describe a little bit of what we mean by a tiny house.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   It's not a tumbleweed plan on a trailer, but it's still relatively small.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.800]   So describe the house and what's the story behind it.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   Okay.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.000]   So our tiny home or...
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Okay.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.600]   Actually, we lived down south for quite a long time and in the south, New Orleans style
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.680]   homes and beach style homes are a big thing.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.840]   And so when we moved up north, no one has houses such as that.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.680]   And I've kind of always made it a little bit of a hobby of mine, building and designing
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   houses.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.800]   I like to build them as small as I can, but really functional.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.460]   So a lot of time you see people with these large houses that aren't functional.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.540]   They have wasted space and they aren't organized well.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:21.200]   They don't use their cabinet space well and they find they just pile up their things rather
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.040]   than having specific places to put them.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:31.580]   And so I like to design a small space that is extremely functional.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.400]   And so that's kind of where it started.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:41.000]   So I would as a hobby design these very tiny homes and then we had an opportunity to build
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   one.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.520]   And so to kind of give people an idea, most tumbleweed houses and tiny homes, they'll
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.480]   fit on a, like what you were saying, on a trailer.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.400]   You may have an 18 foot or 20 foot trailer.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:02.560]   The tiny home we built, we call it a tiny home for us because we're a family of nine.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.360]   So it's, I think, about 1150 square feet.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:13.680]   It's got a dining room, a kitchen, a mudroom area where you can hang jackets.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.600]   It's got a decent size living room, two bedrooms and two full baths.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:27.480]   So we fit all of that into a 14 foot wide by 40 foot long two story house.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:34.000]   And the number one comment we get from everyone is when they walk in, it's like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.040]   it feels so big in here."
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.800]   Because Julie, of course, she does all the architectural designing of these houses and
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.880]   she's really good at organizing the space and making sure there's no wasted space anywhere
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.880]   in these houses.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:53.800]   And we'll both sit over a program, a plan and we'll just go back and forth with ideas
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.480]   and change things until we feel like it's like, "Yeah, that's perfect."
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:06.120]   One thing we did do is we put nine foot ceilings in the home upstairs and downstairs.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:13.520]   And that really opens up your space because people are vertical, most of us, some people
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   are.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:21.400]   But for the taller people, when you have your space go up, rather than creating a large
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.480]   room, it opens it up.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.280]   It makes it feel larger than it is.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.360]   And of course, we always put lots of windows and tall windows.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.920]   So it opens up your space.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.440]   - So that's really cool.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.640]   And the pictures look cool as far as having that New Orleans style, that tall two story,
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.400]   long, narrow and deep house design.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:49.000]   But on the lot, why did you choose that place to build it?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.120]   Because it seems like the lot is so large that the natural decision would be to increase
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   the footprint.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   Am I wrong?
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.560]   - The lot actually for that house is only 25 feet wide.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.480]   - By 125 feet deep.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.080]   - So that specific lot that that house is on-
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.280]   - There's six lots there total.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   - There's actually six lots there that sit side by side.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.480]   So it's got a...
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.120]   The front yard is very, very small.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   I mean, you can...
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.480]   I actually went out there one day and we hadn't bought a lawnmower yet.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.960]   And I had a razor blade, it's called an Olfa blade.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.800]   And kind of as a joke, because our grass was long, so I just sat down and just started
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   kind of like cutting it.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.240]   I actually cut the whole front lawn with a razor blade.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.200]   - But the funny thing about it is I actually videotaped it.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.720]   So we'll have to put that on YouTube.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.920]   - I don't know, I've kind of been holding that video back.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.360]   So the reason I'm probing on this is here on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:00.320]   a lot of strategies that will allow people to build financial freedom in a relatively
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.200]   short period of time.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.800]   And one component of that is income.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.920]   Another component of that is expenses.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   And what stands out to me is because of your design capacity, you've built a really beautiful
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:23.360]   space, but two beautiful spaces, the house and the bus, but on less cost than many other
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.080]   people would face.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.640]   And many people are intimidated by the idea of having seven kids because now I've got
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.160]   to have an 8,000 square foot house.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.440]   What was the path to making these decisions?
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.240]   Have you guys always been weird like this or what was the journey?
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:48.480]   - Probably, we know we're different than probably most people and we're able to just get up.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.920]   One thing we like about what you're talking about, the financial freedom side of it, is
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.080]   when you live small, you're able to do more.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.120]   In the sense like we can just go, "Hey, let's jump in the bus and we're going to go down
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   south."
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.360]   Or someone's invited us to go visit and minister at their church over here.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:18.520]   We can do that because we don't have these enormous home payments.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.240]   Actually that house that you're looking at too, the tiny home, we built that cash as
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:29.360]   well because we were able to sell another house and we've slowly just gotten debt-free.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.600]   And then we built...
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.080]   And you asked the question, "Why did you choose this small house?"
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.240]   Well, we were able to build it debt-free.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   That's the biggest reason.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:44.080]   We were able to build a really beautiful home that feels rich inside, but it's small and
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   we're debt-free.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:53.360]   - Another thing we've discovered is when you have a smaller space, you can buy or invest
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.920]   in maybe the nicer things because you don't have to buy as much of it.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.760]   Say you want to have really nice hardwood floor.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.440]   Well, in a large house, that might be totally out of your budget.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.960]   But if you have a smaller space, you can have really nice wood floors or invest a little
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:18.120]   bit more money into say a really nice set of cabinets where...
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:28.480]   You can get nicer windows and in a smaller space and really make a rich environment where
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   if you have say a large house and you have to kind of lower the cost on some things because
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.280]   you have more carpet to buy or more flooring to buy, more sheetrock, more trim.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.480]   - Yeah, the list goes on.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.520]   - I agree with you.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.480]   And it's one of the things that people often forget that if you are careful with the things
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.960]   that you choose, you can choose to have the things that you want.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.560]   And as my friend Paula Pant says, "You can't afford everything, but you can't afford anything."
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:07.000]   So if you clarify what's more important to you and prioritize that, you can do it.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.120]   And it feels better.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:16.000]   It's better to live in a small luxurious bungalow on the beach than a big ramshackle giant house
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.880]   in the suburbs of some cold city you don't want to be in.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   - Exactly.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.680]   - It's not so much the size.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.520]   It's the choice.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.440]   It's better to have a small wardrobe of clothes that you love and that you feel good in than
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.920]   a closet packed full of things you don't want to wear.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.000]   - My motto is, "If I don't love it, I don't buy it."
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.600]   I come across things that I kind of like.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.960]   In the past, I've gone and bought items because they're on sale, not necessarily because I
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.800]   really liked it.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:53.400]   And whether it's clothing or shoes or pillows or whatever, I find if I don't love it, it
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   sits in my closet.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   I never wear it.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.120]   And then I eventually get rid of it and I revert back to the things I really like.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:06.360]   So especially with so many children, if I don't love that item, I just don't buy it.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.080]   - If you don't love a child, you get rid of them.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:19.040]   - As long as we have so many children, we can't just go in and buy everything we see.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   Even with kids' clothes.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   - I'm just kidding.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.520]   I always, my favorite...
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   - You're teasing me.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   - I am teasing you.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.560]   One of my favorite jokes, it was a little bit funnier before he fell into disgrace,
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.080]   but Bill Cosby always used to say to joke to his kids, one of his jokes was, "Better
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.440]   straighten up because I can get rid of you and make another one look just like you."
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.280]   I just thought that was funny.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:51.040]   - And actually, one other thing I wanted to mention, when Shane and I first had Isaiah,
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:59.160]   he's our oldest son, that we, the typical thing is when you have kids, you start holding
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.460]   back on things that you normally want to do.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.760]   You don't travel as much, you don't go to restaurants because you now have a baby, and
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   we're like, we do not want to live that kind of life.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:16.280]   So from the get-go, we would bring our children to a restaurant and teach them how to behave
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.120]   in that kind of environment.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.000]   And the important thing about that is, for one, we can go out into public and our kids
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.200]   will be well-behaved.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.080]   And then the other thing is living in a small space, the children have learned to respect
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.120]   our authority, and from a young age, we started that.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.760]   So whether we're in a small space and we need them to behave, because that can be a stressful
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:52.360]   environment, they've learned to respect our authority and respect us and what we ask.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:00.320]   - And another thing, too, is you retain your sanity in the sense of, so many times, like
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.040]   what Julie was saying, when people start having children, it seems they almost put their life
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   on hold.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   And one of the things now is if we go to a restaurant or something and people will see
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:20.960]   us walk in with this huge family and, "Oh my gosh, they're seating this huge family
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.440]   next to us," and you kind of see the looks.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   But usually, it never fails.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.640]   By the end of the meal, people always will come over to our table and say, "You know,
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.080]   when we saw you being sat here, we were nervous.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.080]   Is our nice dinner going to be spoiled?
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.440]   But you guys have the best kids and they're so well-behaved and they're quiet."
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.320]   And that comes from living life with your kids.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.160]   You don't have to, just because you have a kid or two kids or three kids, it doesn't
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:58.480]   mean like, "Oh, now I have to stay home," or "We can't go and do things."
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:05.920]   You teach your kids to do things with you, and then they learn how to respect those environments
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.640]   that they're in and it just works so much better.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.360]   I got to admit, I am a little envious of your family, of a beautiful family.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.760]   I got to imagine how much fun a bus trip would be with seven kids.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.400]   It would be a lot of fun.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.880]   I'm the youngest of seven myself.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.060]   So when I say fun, I mean it's a lot of fun.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.160]   My favorite memory is growing up or traveling across the country with my family.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:38.600]   For those who haven't been from a big family, I feel bad for families whose Thanksgiving
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.240]   Day tables are boring.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.280]   Our table is never boring and it's even better.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.760]   I don't know what y'all's family background is, but it's even better now because now not
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   only are there seven kids, but now there's grandchildren all around.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.640]   So our family gatherings are never boring.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:02.720]   Yeah, well you know, my parents, they only had two, it was just me and my sister.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.880]   Looking back, I'm like, "I wish I would have had a brother."
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.280]   There's a lot of cool things I could be doing with my brother right now.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.600]   We do a lot of, we do filming and different things like that.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.920]   I'm like, "Man, if I had a brother, he could be helping me right now."
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.800]   What were my parents thinking?
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.200]   That's where my sister's husband comes into play.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.560]   I don't know if you've seen any of the videos that we have two different YouTube channels.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.840]   We have our Good News Boss channel and then we have our Lugnut Film channel.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.240]   You can meet Chris on the Lugnut Film channel.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.520]   He's the co-host of that with me.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   Awesome.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.920]   I'll take a look at it.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.040]   Practically speaking though, you said your house has two bedrooms.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.480]   I would guess, I mean correct me, but as your children are relatively young right now, do
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.600]   you anticipate moving out and into a different situation in the future?
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   Right.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   We're on the road right now.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.280]   We're not in the house.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.800]   We've been out of it since December.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:15.960]   What the plan is or was, it just depends on what happens, is we have six lots in that
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.240]   location.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:23.440]   We were going to build more of these style homes and increase the size, not tremendously,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.680]   but the next house would have been three bedrooms instead of two, but still keeping that small
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.160]   footprint.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:39.560]   What we did in the second bedroom, we have two sets of bunk beds.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:46.120]   Then above the closet, because we have nine-foot ceilings, we made the closet shorter and we
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.280]   put a built-in bunk bed above there.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.840]   We gained a bedroom there.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.400]   This might sound bad, but our youngest child just slept in our closet.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   It's a walk-in closet.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.840]   It's like an open walk-in closet where the door was never shut kind of thing.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:10.160]   My wife and I, we spent the first year of our marriage in a 234-square-foot studio apartment.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.000]   We had considered where we'd put the kids.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   We had a walk-in closet.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.880]   I figured two kids could go in there and then we could put a bed in the bathtub for the
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.040]   baby if we needed to.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   It is funny.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.280]   I mean, obviously, we're having fun with the subject, but generally, human beings take
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   up what?
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   Let's see.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.080]   If they're small human beings, take up about three linear feet by what?
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   Two feet wide?
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.320]   About six square feet when they're lying down and sleeping.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.760]   They don't need 300 square feet to sleep in.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.760]   They need about six.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.200]   Maybe eight as they grow.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.480]   When we built that, if we would have built it to stay in, I would have designed it in
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.880]   such a way with built-in bunk beds and even a separate room for a girl's room and a boy's
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.480]   room, but we were building it for the purpose of turning it around and selling it.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.560]   I didn't want to have seven built-in beds and stuff like that because resettle wouldn't
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   have been as good.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   Yeah, it wouldn't have been as good.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:15.040]   Our bus is actually more accommodating than the house because we have a bed for almost
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   everybody in the bus.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.560]   Which is kind of funny when you think about it because it's so small.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:29.800]   It's like 220 square feet and it comfortably will sleep eight.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.320]   Then we have the baby, which is nine.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.400]   The youngest one, Seth, shares a bed with Kira.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.160]   They're our two youngest, so they share a bunk right now.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.320]   We get comments.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:49.240]   You can read some of the comments, of course, that people make on our YouTube channel.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.680]   Every once in a while, you get a comment from somebody like, "What are you going to do when
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   they get older?"
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   Oh my gosh.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   We're stuck in the bus.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   We've never thought about that before.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:06.520]   Actually, we already have a plan in the works of doing a new bus.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   We have an opportunity to possibly get a bigger bus.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:15.000]   I've already done the floor plan and everything that has a bed for everybody.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.120]   It actually has a sofa in it, too.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.880]   Yeah, a sofa, living room area.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.440]   That sounds awesome.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.820]   Tell me more about your lifestyle.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:32.720]   It sounds like you guys have built what, from just an initial glance, seems to be a really
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.280]   fun family integrated lifestyle.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.480]   How do you earn your income?
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.800]   What does your average year look like?
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.680]   What's your lifestyle like?
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:54.000]   A lot of our lifestyle, as far as financially, is very much based on trusting and really
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   faith that—
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.640]   Let's say the glue of our life is Jesus.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.240]   It isn't money.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.920]   We learned a long time ago that finances and having things and having money isn't what
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.280]   makes you happy.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.240]   We can look at society and see that you look at Hollywood.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.280]   These people have millions of dollars in the bank and people are committing suicide.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.680]   They're unhappy.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.760]   The divorce rate, all that stuff.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.800]   I think you hear—and you would probably know better on this—but you hear that so
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.480]   many marriages are destroyed because of finances.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:41.160]   We've had several times in our life where we have had zero dollars in the bank account.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.760]   It didn't shake us.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.120]   Why not?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.640]   I wouldn't say it never has shaken us.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:55.580]   Early on, there were some times where Julie and I originally were managing three businesses
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.120]   at one point, retail stores.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.400]   This was back in 2005, I guess.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:12.760]   What happened was when the economy really started to tank, we pretty much lost.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.440]   All of our stores were paid for.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:21.800]   They were debt-free, but we had put hours and hours of work and time into these stores,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.440]   and then we had to just shut them down.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:33.200]   That going through that, it never affected Julie and I's relationship or our marriage
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   or anything like that.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:42.000]   It was a time of like, "Man, all of that time, all of that building and stuff."
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.400]   We learned a lot from going through that.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.440]   >> JANICE KATZ: We were fortunate that we didn't have to go bankrupt and we didn't
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:55.320]   have to have any debts to pay off.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.440]   People say, because we always have managed to stay out of debt.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.280]   >> KYLE BASS: Yeah.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.800]   Then we just kind of go, "Well, okay, let's just keep moving here.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.640]   Let's just keep going on."
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.760]   I make money by doing carpentry work.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.880]   I do carpentry work.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:21.640]   I also volunteer for our ministry, and I do music.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:28.720]   As far as the music side of things go, web design, and we do video stuff.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:35.640]   None of these things are bringing in just tons of cash by any means.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:41.680]   Our family, whether it's through people blessing us or whether it's through a job I get, we're
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.440]   always taken care of and we've always had enough.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.600]   We've always had food on the table.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.920]   That's really what the important things are.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.600]   If you get a little extra money and you're able to do something fun, then that's great.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.440]   The most important thing is that the family's happy.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:07.200]   The kids have a mom and a dad that love them, and the mom and dad love each other.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.880]   Those are really the most important things.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:22.640]   Preston Pysh (00:36:40):
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.760]   You guys live an unusual lifestyle.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   Have you ever regretted having so many kids, which obviously they require food to eat?
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.120]   Have you ever regretted it?
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.160]   Matt Theron (00:37:00):
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.680]   Not for a second, actually.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.860]   We never planned on having a big family.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.640]   If someone would have asked me before I got married, "How many kids do you want to have?"
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.880]   I'd probably, "Oh, one or two, I guess."
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.920]   It wasn't anything planned at all.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.000]   Rachel Tauber (00:37:22):
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.560]   I'm actually from Canada originally.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.600]   Shane and I had a very long-distance relationship before we got married.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:13.400]   I got married really young, and so we actually had our first child not even a year after
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   we got married.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.580]   We got pregnant right off the bat.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.280]   Just the ball's been rolling from there.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.800]   We love every one of our children.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.240]   There's been times when I'm like, "Oh my goodness, we have three kids in diapers right now."
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.940]   I've literally been changing a diaper almost every day for the last 12 years, whether they're
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.680]   a toddler or an infant.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.120]   There's always been a diaper to change.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   Matt Theron (00:38:02):
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:49.200]   I try not to tell myself that I could have bought a brand new BMW with the amount I've
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.400]   spent on diapers.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.000]   I try to tell myself that.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.920]   I try to forget those facts.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:01.800]   Have you learned any tips, tools, tactics, techniques, tricks that come to mind that
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.720]   have helped you guys make the dollar stretch?
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   Rachel Tauber (00:38:22):
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.960]   We tried cloth diapers for a while, and I don't know.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.760]   The cost didn't seem to outweigh.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   Matt Theron (00:38:29):
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   Honestly, yeah, there are a few tips for saving money.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.640]   One of the things that we learned, we did what every parent, I think, does when they
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.320]   have their first child.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.200]   They have a baby shower, and they'll get gifts from that.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.960]   Anything they don't get in their baby shower, they'll go out and they'll buy the diaper
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   genies.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:39.240]   I can't even think of all the ... I know you could have a room full of things.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.000]   You can have a cradle, and you have all this stuff.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Rachel Tauber (00:38:56):
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.520]   I think with Isaiah, we had the diaper genie and cribs and every little thing that you
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.520]   could think of.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:56.560]   Pretty soon, as time goes on, you're like, "Boy, gosh, you don't even really need these
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   things."
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:03.680]   There's a lot of those things you don't actually really need.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.200]   You're told that you need them.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.760]   Okay, you have to have this, you have to have that.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:14.880]   We've gotten to the point of just being, as far as parenting, raising young children,
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:21.320]   pretty laid back in the sense of not having to have all these things that-
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   Julia Miller (00:39:34):
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   I don't even have a diaper bag.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:29.960]   I always just keep a diaper in a little container, wipes in my purse.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:36.040]   I'm probably the worst at being prepared, I guess.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.480]   I don't bring a closet of clothes with us when we go out somewhere for my child.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:47.440]   We try to teach the kids, "Okay, when you sit at the table and eat, don't get it all
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   over yourself."
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   Shae Giesinger (00:40:05):
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.280]   Shane can't stand dirty hands.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.160]   It was funny, our kids got it drilled in their head so much to keep their hands clean that
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.800]   they'd go to fall on the ground and they're trying not to touch the ground to get up so
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.760]   they don't get their hands dirty.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Shane Giesinger (00:40:17):
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.000]   Now, they still play outside.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   They still play in the dirt.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.920]   Shae Giesinger (00:40:22):
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920]   They're good.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   Shane Giesinger (00:40:24):
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   I guess we've tried to ward off things that we see other people having to struggle with
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   and deal with.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:28.080]   We meet people constantly and we'll go to Walmart or we'll have moms come up to us.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.040]   They're like, "I can't even handle my one kid.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.480]   How do you guys handle seven?"
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.160]   Just trying to encourage them and telling them, "Just have more kids and it'll get
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   better."
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.840]   I did find that once I had two or three kids, it seemed easier than just one.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.400]   Maybe because I was also a new parent.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.680]   Then the other thing is the more kids you have, the more they occupy each other.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.640]   If Ethan doesn't want to play with Elisha anymore, he can go play with Ashton or Kira
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   or Isaiah.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.360]   There's always a buddy to hang out with.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   I don't know.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   Shane Giesinger (00:41:02):
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.480]   It becomes where they very much occupy each other and help each other.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:17.920]   Elisha for example, he's our six-year-old.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.160]   When Julie started, because she homeschools all the kids, when it came time to him start
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.700]   his schooling, he already knew so much from learning from the other kids.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.400]   They would spend hours playing things like Monopoly and learning how to count money and
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   all that stuff.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.560]   So Julie sat down with him one day.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.560]   I think it was her first time to go over some math with him.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.560]   Julie Schneider (00:41:29):
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   It was like real school.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.240]   Hey, we're pulling … because the kids from a young age, they always want to sit down
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.400]   with the other kids and do school.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.040]   This was the first year of him like, "Okay, this is your set of books and we're going
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.600]   to have a regular schedule."
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   Shane Giesinger (00:41:43):
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.920]   She sat down with him and she's going through some math problems and he's popping off these
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.280]   answers to her.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.640]   She's like, "Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   How are you …"
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   Julie Schneider (00:41:54):
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   Calculating this.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   Shane Giesinger (00:41:54):
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   "How are you calculating this?"
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.440]   He's like, "Well, this plus this equals that."
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.400]   He learned all of that from of course …
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   Julie Schneider (00:42:02):
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   Playing Monopoly.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   Shane Giesinger (00:42:02):
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.640]   Playing Monopoly or they'll sit down with … they'll play cards together.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.360]   They'll invent their own games.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   Julie Schneider (00:42:10):
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   Ashton and Ethan.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.320]   Ashton is our math child.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.960]   So everything is mathematical.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:33.480]   He sat down and figured out a game to play with speed, but they play with flashcards.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.240]   So I'll have one plus five is this.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.640]   So whoever has the highest sum would win the pile or whatever.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:47.420]   So it was teaching them to add or subtract quickly.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.120]   He invented that game when he was six years old.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.800]   So that was the games they would come up with.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   But that's only Ashton.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   He's special.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   Shane Giesinger (00:42:41):
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.320]   So then the younger kids are encouraged by that and they want to play and they want to
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.640]   learn and, "Oh, this is exciting."
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:07.600]   So really what's cool about it is it's like doing school but not feeling the suffering
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   of doing school.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   You know?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   Ashton Silver (00:42:56):
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   Why do you guys homeschool?
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   Shane Giesinger (00:43:00):
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   Well, being mobile, I was homeschooled.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   I turned out halfway normal.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   Julie Schneider (00:43:04):
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.720]   I went to public school.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:28.280]   Public school has some great programs too, but there's just, honestly, I think mostly
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.400]   I wanted to teach the children.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.840]   I figured most kids maybe want to be around their parents until they're 13.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.360]   And then once they get to the teenage years, they kind of want their own space.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.640]   So I figured, "Okay, I have 13 years that I can spend as much time as I can with my
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.240]   kids and I get to be involved in their learning."
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.520]   And the thing that's been amazing about it is that I've learned their strengths and
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   their weaknesses.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.480]   And I know the kids will probably hate me for telling you this, but we started English,
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.440]   I think it was two years ago, and they were doing terrible with it.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   And it was grade five English.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.360]   And I'm like, "Okay, we're going back to grade three."
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.600]   So I actually made all the kids go back to grade three and start over.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.400]   And we actually have kind of a policy that if they don't get 80% or better, they have
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.480]   to redo the assignment.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:29.560]   So I figured if they don't get 80% or better, that they didn't learn enough of it.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:35.360]   And it would be better to go back and get it down rather than just keep moving forward.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:43.000]   And so we went back to grade three English, back to English, and they flew through it.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.040]   And I found that they improved drastically.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:55.880]   And the foundational stuff was being laid down properly.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:03.120]   So I'm able to do that in a normal class setting in a public school or a private school, whatever
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.920]   it might be.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.420]   The teacher might not pick up on those things or be able to take them back, "Hey, you need
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.880]   to go back to grade three in English."
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:20.280]   If Ashton, he's actually three grades ahead in math, and he wouldn't be able to be in
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:26.720]   a normal grade for the other subjects and be in a higher grade in math in a public school
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   setting.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.320]   So I don't know, I'm really flexible with that area.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.720]   And I love it.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   It's great.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.000]   - So Julie's able to really see their strengths, see their weaknesses.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.880]   And then, like she said, with Ashton, she's able to say, "Okay, you're good where you
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.680]   are in English and spelling, but you are just flying through this math.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.800]   So we're going to step you up."
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.440]   And he eventually stepped up three grades in math.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.960]   So she's able to keep him where he's doing good in his English and his reading and that
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.880]   kind of stuff, and then advance him in things.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:07.280]   So he's able to cultivate, in a sense, that gifting he has in math, and he's able to keep
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.280]   going with that.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.760]   And it's not being stifled, in a sense.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.440]   - And I know probably a big question people are like, "How can you homeschool seven kids?"
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:23.160]   Well, once they learn how to read, they take the initiative and they do the school on their
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.160]   own.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.000]   And I tell them a lot of the time that they will be done their schoolwork before I am
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.680]   done breakfast.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   So they will get up super early in the morning because they want to be able to play the rest
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   of the day.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:43.360]   So they'll go and they'll finish their schoolwork beforehand, and then I correct it and probably
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   spend the rest of the day correcting their school.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.440]   And then we'll do it on the days that they have a test.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.520]   They don't do that beforehand.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.200]   I'm the one that supervises that.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:03.280]   So it's neat that way because it's not like I'm sitting down with each kid.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:08.040]   Unless they have an issue, a problem that they can't figure out on their own, then I'll
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   of course help them with that.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:14.480]   But for the most part, the textbooks have been amazing in explaining things.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.880]   There's some really good curriculum out there right now.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.520]   - How's the music business?
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.640]   - The music business is, well here, I'll just sum it up.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.720]   We give away way more than we sell.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.480]   - We're not in it.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   - We're not in the music business to make money at all.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.280]   We love blessing people with our music.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:46.640]   And a matter of fact, a lot of it's available for free out there.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:54.360]   But it gives us something to be able to, first of all, when we go and minister, it's something
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.280]   that we can either give to people or we can have a product available for people.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:04.440]   And then many times, just in meeting people and getting in conversations with people,
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:11.720]   I have download cards that give people a free download of one of our latest CDs.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.440]   And it gives me something to give to people.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.640]   Not only are we talking to them about our family or about the Lord, but it gives us
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.760]   something that we can give people as well.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:32.000]   And we love doing the music, and we've invested a lot into it, recognizing that we're not
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.720]   going to necessarily, it's hard to get, if you're not labeled, we're not labeled.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.920]   If you're not labeled, it's hard to get your music out there.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   And the industry is changing a lot with iTunes.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.880]   You've got a lot of these artists that are going independent and things like that.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.360]   >> JOANNA: We do it because we love it.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.800]   >> BRYAN: Yeah, we do it because we love it.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:05.520]   My very first CD, which I came out with, that was back in 2001, I think.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.880]   That one actually got national airplay here and around the world.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.440]   I was doing a lot of traveling then.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.320]   That's before Julie and I were married.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:21.760]   I actually met Julie in Canada on a mission trip up there to her church.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.440]   And that's how we met.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.240]   The music that we've done, we've put out three albums since then.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.040]   We came out with an EP with three songs on it.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   And then just recently, we came out with two new singles.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:42.040]   And it's one way we always, every once in a while, we'll post and say, "Look, if you
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:48.400]   want to support what we're doing, you can purchase our music and you get something in
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.720]   return for your purchase or whatever."
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.040]   So yeah, that's kind of how the music is going right now.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.960]   >> LEE: Final two questions, one related to the bus and the other just more general.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.360]   On your website, you indicate that your guess is that the bus cost you about $30,000.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:09.000]   It's a pretty sizable sum of money.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.040]   I'm curious, have you ever regretted doing the bus conversion?
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:18.080]   Have you ever wished that you had gone and spent $30,000 on just a used RV?
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.040]   >> BILLY: No.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.400]   We had sold a house.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.880]   Like I said, the house was owned by the ministry.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   And the ministry actually gave us a certain amount of money to be able to do the bus,
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:39.520]   knowing that it would be used often and get a lot of use out of it.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.480]   So in that sense, no.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:48.080]   And also that we were able to—I mean, it is still usable for our family.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.280]   It's got the bed arrangements and a very nice kitchen.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:49:00.320]   A couple other things that are unique about it is you're able to design it to who you
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.600]   are and what your family is.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.840]   I knew that we were going to need a hot water heater that was going to be able to keep up
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   with our family.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.560]   And most RV hot water heaters are like a six-gallon or a ten-gallon.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.800]   I'm like, if all our kids are out running around playing or we go somewhere and they
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.200]   get dirty, how in the world are we going to shower all of our kids off with a ten-gallon
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   hot water heater?
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.720]   I just don't think that's going to happen.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:34.480]   And so we checked around and we found an InstaHot hot water heater, which are very, very efficient.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.080]   And it's a company called Precision Temp that makes them.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.200]   And things like that.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.520]   So you're able to—if you just went out and bought a used RV, it's not going to have
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.240]   all these things.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.080]   Another thing is the stove that we have.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.280]   It's got an oven.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   Julie actually bakes—I mean, there's pictures on our Facebook page.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.840]   Our Good News Bus Facebook page.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.400]   But she'll bake cinnamon rolls.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.720]   She's made full Thanksgiving dinners, turkeys in that oven.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.520]   And most RVs don't have—
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.000]   I bake bread twice a week.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.160]   She bakes her own homemade sourdough.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.880]   This is real sourdough, not made with yeast from the store.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   I mean, it's real sourdough.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.880]   It's my pet.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.880]   I have to feed it.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.800]   She has to feed the starter and all that stuff.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.080]   And we want to do more videos about that kind of stuff.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.800]   So the bus and then the bunks, the bunk arrangements and everything.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   Every aspect.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   It's wood.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.200]   I mean, we have solid oak wood everywhere.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:43.480]   We have hardwood floors and stone countertop.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:50.640]   And to get something that nice, to buy it off of, say, a lot, you're going to pay a
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.760]   lot of money.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.120]   The other thing is it's a school bus.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:59.720]   Not many people have a school bus that they're living in and they're safe.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.440]   They're one of the safest road vehicles.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.800]   I mean, they're actually designed—because they're designed for kids, they're designed
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.960]   to actually, if they get in a horrible wreck, they can actually roll over without collapsing
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.160]   on themselves.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:20.160]   So even that aspect of it with an RV, it's going to be all over the road.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.080]   Plus, I have good news for you.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.080]   Go ahead.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.360]   I'd love it.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:30.160]   You can convert a bus and raise the roof to your height.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.160]   That's right.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.440]   So you could do it for you.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.440]   There's hope.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.160]   I always figured I'd need like a Greyhound coach, something that's a little bit taller
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.480]   if I were ever going to do it.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   There's a lot of people.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   A lot of people do it.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.960]   And it's one of the things we looked at.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.880]   It's one of the things I somewhat regret not doing is raising the roof just to give
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.240]   it that extra open feel.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.280]   But yeah, a lot of people will do that.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.860]   They will raise the roof on their bus.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:08.520]   You can raise it an extra foot, an extra foot and a half, and it gives you that extra headroom.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   Awesome.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.560]   Final question is this.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:18.080]   The lifestyle that you have been able to put together, it sounds – obviously, it has
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.920]   challenges.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.920]   We all have challenges.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.160]   We all have problems.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.720]   We all have difficult days.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:31.840]   But it sounds to me like you've been able to put together a very integrated lifestyle
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:37.440]   that allows you to do work that's important to you with the people that you care about
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.800]   and you did it without coming from – parents didn't leave you tons of money.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.680]   You've worked at it yourself.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:49.000]   What advice would you give to somebody who's trying to kind of break free of the normal
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.400]   humdrum of US-American existence and build a more integrated life?
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.320]   What advice or counsel would you give them?
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.880]   Well, I would – I mean, Julie can answer too.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:05.440]   I would say do your best, first of all, to stay out of debt.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:11.360]   From pretty much all the ventures we've ever done, we've tried to do that.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:17.040]   We've tried to completely – whether it's starting a retail store or anything like that,
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.000]   we always started very small.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.720]   One of the businesses we started was in our home and it started with an internet business.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.480]   We didn't go and open a humongous store and spend millions of dollars.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.320]   We started slow where we would buy a couple pieces of product and sell it and grew that
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.320]   way.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.520]   That's kind of the – I think usually when we're looking, "Okay,
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.160]   we want to do something.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.160]   We don't have the funds to do it."
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.760]   We don't think, "Okay, where can we get a loan?"
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:52.720]   We think, "Okay, what can we sell that's of value that can give us a start and give us
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.360]   steps into the right direction or a direction that we want to go?"
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.800]   We're not very attached to anything.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   Anything can be –
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:09.480]   Our very first house that Julie and I built together after we were married, it took us
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.280]   I think three or four years to finish because we built it debt free.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.200]   That's probably the biggest advice because then after you build a house debt free, you're
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.160]   not tied to it for 30 years.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.880]   The amount that you end up – I think I did calculating once.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:32.400]   The amount you pay for just your toilet in your house on a 30-year mortgage is just – when
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.840]   you start calculating all that stuff, you just kind of go, "Oh my gosh.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.800]   I can't believe this."
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.500]   That would probably be the biggest thing.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:46.080]   Not having debt frees you up a little bit because if you want to sell your house, you
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   can sell it.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.560]   Which, you can do that if you're in debt with a house as well.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.920]   But if you want to have a house and you can't sell it and you want to just be able to leave
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.960]   and go do something else, hey, you still own a house and it's still paid for.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:05.240]   Or if you get in a sticky situation where maybe you are unemployed or you become ill
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:11.360]   and you can no longer pay a mortgage payment, then you're not put in an even worse position
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.800]   where you're losing your house now.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:22.040]   Ben: I know that for us, it's made things a lot freer.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:29.280]   Our tiny home that we have, we don't owe anything on that and no mortgage.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.600]   We're able to, "Hey, let's go and do work here."
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.920]   We don't have that extra amount of money that we have to make.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.520]   It's already enough.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.400]   It costs a lot to feed our family.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.880]   Rachel: If you have a mortgage, you're also strapped with insurance.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.180]   You have to have insurance with a mortgage.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.400]   Some people might call it risky for us not to have insurance.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.160]   There's times that we just cancel our insurance if we don't have the money.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:02.160]   We're flexible to be able to do that because we don't have a mortgage.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.120]   So it's another area where we can save where most people can't.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.080]   Ben: Great lessons, guys.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.000]   I appreciate you guys sharing a little bit of your life and your lifestyle with us.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   So goodnewsbus.com is one website.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.640]   Share with us your other websites, YouTube channels.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.240]   Promote all the different places and ways that people can find you here.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   Ryan: Sure.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.560]   Goodnewsbus.com has got a full ... We blogged from the beginning of the bus to the end.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   You can go on there.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.880]   It's a great resource if it's something that you're looking to wanting to do, if your listeners
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.280]   are wanting to do something like that.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:41.760]   I also just started a forum on there, too, just to communicate with people more.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:48.120]   Lugnutfilms.com is kind of our film side of things.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:52.820]   We're trying to produce more and more bus life with nine videos.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:59.240]   So you can go on YouTube and type in "Good News Bus" and you'll find all of our videos
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.600]   there, and our Bus Life with Nine videos.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.840]   And then our Lugnut Film videos, we have a carpentry show.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.360]   We do some tool reviews, and we always add kind of humor and make it fun.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.080]   And then we're on Facebook and Twitter, all the usual places.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.240]   Yeah, we love to hear ...
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:23.160]   Shana: Literally, if you type in shangood.com, that will take you even to our music page.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:28.640]   Kyle: Yeah, shangood.com will take you to our music page, and you're able to listen
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.360]   to a sample, a lot of music on there.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.160]   And our music, of course, is on iTunes.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.920]   If you just type in "Shangood," it'll be on there.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.440]   And Julie and I do the music together.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.960]   I am the lead singer.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:45.400]   I play some of the instruments, and then Julie does backup singing on there as well.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.200]   We actually hired professional people in the industry to help us do those projects.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.800]   So they are well-done projects.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:58:02.440]   Dave: How on earth did you manage to be able to do this interview and have a quiet background?
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.440]   Where are your kids?
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:08.040]   Kyle: We actually ran over to a friend's house.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:14.020]   We have some friends in the area, and we're at a very good friend's house right now.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.480]   So the kids are with grandma and grandpa.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.080]   Dave: That's funny, because I have two kids, and I can hardly get a quiet recording in.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.680]   I've been impressed with that.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.000]   Kyle: My daughter, Arwen, she actually asked me, she goes, "So are we going to be on?"
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.520]   I'm like, "Well, not this time, sweetie.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.520]   Maybe next time."
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.520]   Arwen: Yeah, she would have loved it.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.200]   Kyle: She would have loved to be on it, too.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.720]   Dave: Well, Shane and Julie, thank you guys so much for coming on.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.040]   I really appreciate you sharing your story and your life with my audience.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   Shane and Julie: Great.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.040]   Arwen: Thanks for having us.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:49.880]   I've seen people from every walk of life, from every situation, figure out a plan to
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:55.320]   pursue their own family goals, to build and fulfill their own family vision.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   I've seen it no matter...
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.800]   I just said it.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   I've seen it from everywhere.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.840]   So here's my encouragement today.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   Many of you are looking at something in your life and saying, "This is an obstacle."
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   And guess what?
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.100]   You're right.
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.960]   Some of the things that you have in your life are obstacles.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.800]   We're not all in the same situation.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.560]   But many obstacles can be overcome.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.280]   Many obstacles can be destroyed.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.760]   And many obstacles can be integrated into a plan.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.720]   If you're deeply in debt, you might need to get out of debt first.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.440]   That's an obstacle that can be taken care of.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.440]   If you have kids, no, it's not going to be...
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.800]   Everything is not going to be the same as when you're single or with just you and your
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   spouse.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.800]   It's going to be different.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.800]   But guess what?
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.960]   Kids are not an obstacle.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:50.560]   You can figure out a way to adjust to the situation and fulfill all of the goals and
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.660]   the vision that you have as a family.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:57.020]   Hope you were inspired and motivated by that interview today.
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.020]   Hope you found it valuable.
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.660]   I love stories like that.

[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.720]   It's really, really cool.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.020]   So it's really well done, really, really beautiful.
