[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, how does one climb the corporate ladder all for the sake of the gospel? Today's question
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.480]   comes from a podcast listener named Dan with a very good question. "Pastor John, thank
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.120]   you for the podcast. I recently heard the episode on work and how we glorify God at
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.840]   our jobs. I want to glorify God in all things, and my question is more detailed. I know that
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.860]   I can glorify God in my work. I also know that work is my mission field. The question
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.360]   is really how do I balance my earthly work with eternal work? How do I balance climbing
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.580]   the corporate ladder at the same time pursuing relationships and caring for the lost? As
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.860]   a Christian, do I simply say that God will take care of me and I don't need to focus
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.480]   on climbing the ladder at all? Or as a Christian, is it glorifying to God for me to be great
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.800]   at my job and to get promoted? Then how do I also not forget about reaching out to others?
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.520]   How do I find balance in this tension, Pastor John?"
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.100]   In one sense, it's presumptuous of me to try to answer this question, because I've never
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.640]   had a long-term, full-time job other than teaching and preaching. There were summers
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.280]   when I worked full-time digging swimming pools one summer, bagging groceries one summer,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.780]   working in the shipping department filling boxes one summer, working as a water safety
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.080]   instructor at a camp one summer, being a pole holder at a surveying company one summer.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.920]   But I never felt any sense of long-term calling to any of those, nor any hope of advancement.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.800]   They just were filling the time, putting money in the bank so I could get married someday,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.220]   maybe, and get myself through school. None of those jobs lasted longer than several months,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:57.520]   so I'm just not experienced in Dan's situation, but I assume he knows that, since he's still
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.040]   asking me, asking the Bible guy for counsel. So, all right, let's go for it. And you can
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.160]   decide whether what I'm saying is coming out of a spiritual ivory tower that has no use
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.960]   for real world, or whether it might be helpful. So it seems to me that the challenge Dan is
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.720]   facing, and that all of us face, is the challenge of how to live a fully integrated—and that's
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.080]   the key word—integrated Christ-honoring life. So Dan poses the question in terms of
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   balance. Balancing earthly work and eternal work. Balancing efforts to become excellent
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.040]   in the vocational tasks of climbing the ladder, and excellence in loving people, and evangelizing
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.680]   people, and caring about people. And really, what he's asking, I think, and what we all
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.000]   want, is a life that is so integrated with Christ as the agent of the integration that
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   we don't feel pulled in separate directions, right? So we're not standing between saying,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   "Oh, I feel both," but rather the whole thing feels cohesive, it feels whole, it feels like
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.560]   there's integrity to all the pieces of my life. That's what we're after. So let me
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:27.760]   suggest that the real challenge for Dan, and people in the work world like that, is probably
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:38.320]   asking the question of, "What is required in my specific vocational tasks that every
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.680]   unbeliever as well as believer has to do?" The challenge then is that these tasks can
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.160]   feel not very distinctly Christian, and therefore not fully integrated into a coherent life
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.040]   where tasks and relationships are just pulled apart from each other. So that's what we
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.800]   want to try to move beyond. And the way I've tried to approach it is that there are questions
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:19.760]   to ask, or reflections, or ponderings on our specific vocational tasks that might begin
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   to transform those, what he calls "earthly work," into something more coherent with
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.360]   the rest of our life. So I'm going to name about ten of these. Just name them real quick.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.640]   And maybe this will help Dan convert earthly work, so-called, into the obedience of faith
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.480]   and an honor to Jesus so that everything feels more coherent. So here we go. Number one,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.600]   ponder the ultimate aim. And I'm going to emphasize the key word each time, it's a
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.520]   key word, "aim." Ponder the ultimate aim of the tasks and the less-than-ultimate
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   aims and see if you can state those aims in terms of specifically Christian or Christ-exalting
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:18.240]   outcomes for the company. Number two, ponder how the quality of your work relates to the
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.680]   nature of God and your calling as a Christian. Can you see the quality, the excellence of
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.800]   your work, not merely in a worldly way, but in a Christian way of testimony, not just
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:37.520]   a worldly way of advancement? Number three, ponder your tasks as forms of service. Think
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   them through in the category of how they serve other people, both in their outcomes and in
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.680]   the way you do them. Christians are fundamentally servants of others. We count others more significant
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.920]   than ourselves, that is, we count them worthy of our service. Number four, ponder your tasks
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:03.360]   in relationship to the value of honesty or integrity. How will absolute allegiance to
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   the truth shape the way you do what you do, and how is that rooted in allegiance to Jesus?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.160]   Number five, ponder the relationship between the tasks you do and the spirit of thankfulness
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:28.720]   to God, simple thankfulness that you can just do the tasks. Linger over this question long
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.120]   enough so that you can feel the specifics of how you're thankful for your thinking and
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.720]   thankful to God for your feeling and thankful for your skills and thankful for your hands
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.120]   and thankful for your eyes and your ears and the gift of this job and a dozen other things.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:55.680]   Let a spirit of thankfulness permeate everything about the tasks that you do. Number six, ponder
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.400]   how humility will mark the way you do your tasks. Think through what humility would look
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   like in your particular role and in the tasks that you do. Number seven, pray earnestly
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.360]   that the Lord will give you joy in your work, not just alongside your work in other things
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.760]   you like to do, but in your work, in the very tasks, in the relationships involved in those
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:30.560]   tasks. Ask the Lord that your joy in Him would thoroughly saturate all you do. Number eight,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:38.800]   ask the Lord to give you—this is one of the hardest ones—utter freedom from murmuring
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:46.160]   and complaining in your tasks. In Philippians 2, 14 and 15, Paul says that to be free from
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:55.520]   murmuring makes Christians shine like stars in the night sky of this world. It is so rare.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:04.880]   Number nine, ponder how manifestations of patience can permeate all that you do. In other words,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:12.640]   let patience be woven through all your responses to the tasks you have to perform and all the people
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:21.040]   that you're involved with in those tasks. And number ten, ponder how you can actually see
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:32.880]   the nature of God, the aspects of the glory of God, in the very kind of work that you are doing.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:41.840]   God is the maker, the creator of molecules of everything you handle. He's the creator of
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:52.320]   mass and grammar. He's the creator of all human capacities. Nothing that you deal with is foreign
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:00.960]   to God but speaks something of God. There's a language out there to be read, and God is the
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:10.800]   meaning of the language. Develop the ability to read God in all your tasks. And finally,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:20.000]   I could call it number 11, or I could say it's the sum of all of them. Ponder how everything you do
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   is an expression of love—love to God, love to people. So here they are. Aim, quality, service,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.960]   honesty, thankfulness, humility, joy, not murmuring, patience, seeing, love. And my guess is
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:45.840]   that if you devote yourself, Dan, to this kind of prayer and pondering, you will find that the
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:56.800]   earthly work, the tasks, the so-called vocational, ordinary, secular tasks that you do are not as
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.120]   distinct as you think they are from the eternal work and all the relationships around you.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.720]   Yeah, that's great. Thank you, Pastor John. You really were a poll holder for a survey company?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.440]   Yeah. I remember the summer of '68. I wrote poems about it,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.240]   standing on a railroad track looking, and the railroad track happened to be the keys on the
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   piano, and this field of wheat, I think it was, had a river, and the river shaped the field just
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   like a grand piano, and the railroad was the keyboard. And they sent me down this railroad
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.000]   till I was almost out of sight. Go down there and hold that thing. And I was standing there all by
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.960]   myself while they were a mile away shooting this thing, and I thought, "This is gorgeous!"
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.400]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.760]   The poll holding poet. The poetry surprises no one. It's the poll holding that does. Thank you,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.800]   Pastor John. And maybe someone listening right now is on a surveyor's crew. And if so, thank you for

[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.400]   Well, we're going to close out the week talking again about doomsday preparations.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   It's a follow-up question to ask, "Isn't preparing for the worst possible catastrophe
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:01.440]   like a nuclear apocalypse? Isn't that an act of a man's love and service to his wife and his family?"
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.680]   It's a twist on the conversation that we had earlier. And I will pose it to you, Pastor John,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.320]   next time we meet. Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you on Friday.
