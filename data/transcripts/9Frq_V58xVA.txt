[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   In South Korea, a 78-year-old pastor was sentenced to three years in prison after being found guilty of embezzling millions of dollars.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   He's also the pastor of the largest church in the world.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John, I know you've been following the situation, and you want to say something about it here on Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Yes, I do.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   With every public dishonoring of Christ, and every public dishonoring of His Word and His Gospel and His Church,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   it makes me angry and it makes me sorrowful.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I once heard David Hubbard, the former president of Fuller Seminary, say,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   "We pay people according to how many dishes break if they drop the tray."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And I thought at the time, "That's right. I guess in American culture that is what we do."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And here I say, "Yes, and the more dishes break when you drop the tray, the more indignation the restaurant owner has
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   or the people who depend upon the waiter to carry the tray."
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And so when a pastor drops the tray again, well, here are the facts.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Maybe people don't really know about the situation.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   David Yong Hee Cho is the pastor of the largest church in the world, Pentecostal Congregation in Yeouido.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   It's called Yeouido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, Korea, with a million members.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   He's been sentenced to three years in prison for embezzling about $12 million in church funds.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And his son was found guilty.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   As far as I know, his son is already serving his sentence,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   and the sentence of David Yong Hee Cho has been suspended for five years.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And my response to this is really not to pile on with any additional condemnation of David Yong Hee Cho,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   but rather to try to respond for the rest of us in a way that prevents this kind of thing as much as possible.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Paul said in Galatians 6, "Brothers, if anyone is caught in a transgression,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Now that's what I assume is happening with his elders and his leaders.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I can't do that from America. I'm counting on the church there to do that.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   But then it says, "Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Okay, now that we can do. That I can do.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so I want to keep watch on myself, and I want pastors to keep watch on themselves.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So, Tony, I have five pleas. I want to give five pleas to pastors.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   My hope is that pastors will listen to this, and they'll take this 68-year-old pastor's heart,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   aching that we not bring this kind of reproach upon the name of Christ.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So plea number one is kill every desire to be rich and get rich.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Don't want this.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   If you see the desire in your heart, take aim at it with the words of Christ and the words of Paul,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and put it to death with a swift blow of the sword of the Spirit.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Jesus said how difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   In other words, don't want this.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It's easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Why would you want to be rich?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And Paul said those who desire to be rich pierce themselves with many pangs in 1 Timothy 6.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So that's number one. Kill every desire to be rich in the ministry.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Number two, I plead with pastors that if you see your income starting to grow,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   set a governor on it and keep away from accumulating more and more
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and communicating to your people that you lay up treasures on earth.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   One of the best ways to do this, I think, is to grow the percentage of your giving.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm not impressed with pastors who give 30% of a million-dollar royalty check
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and keep 70% of it to buy luxuries with.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I've heard pastors boast that they give 30%, 40%, or maybe evenâ€”
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I'm not even impressed with giving 90% of a 10-million-dollar royalty check
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and keeping a million dollars to play with while you look like every other millionaire
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and think that you've done a virtuous thing because you've given away 90% of your money.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   That's just not the issue. Money is insidiously deceptive.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   We've seen it over and over again, and I'm pleading with pastors,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   be content with what the church pays you and give the rest away with joy and strategic wisdom.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And number three, I plead with pastors to be totally transparent with your fellow elders
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   from inside your church so that they know what your income is from all your sources.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   These elders should not be the wealthy, powerful peers or friends from outside the church.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's an unbiblical way to lead your flock.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It has no biblical foundation, and it communicates distrust for your local leaders
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and a kind of pride that you're above their local accountability.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Let all the books of your income be open to any member of your church who asks the elders.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Secrecy around money is deadly. It's a sign that something is not right.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So work to give your ministry the flavor. We're not like peddlers of God's word.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Plea number four, I plead with you to live simply and to model for your people
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   a way of showing that your treasure is in heaven and not on earth.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Please don't write this off by calling it pauper theology.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   "There goes Piper again with his pauper theology." That is absolutely ridiculous.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The kind of distortion that that makes of what I'm saying is a sign of fear
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   that what I'm saying just might be true.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   You have to distort it with pauper theology to escape the truth.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I've said nothing about being a pauper.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I'm talking about get a car that works and gets you where you need to go.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Get a car that doesn't break down on you every few months.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I'm talking about a modest entertainment budget that doesn't eat out every night.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I'm talking about a refreshing vacation, not an exorbitant one.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I'm talking about clothes that are unremarkable and undistracting,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   both for not being shabby and not being brand driven.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I'm talking about a home that accomplishes your family and your ministry purposes,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   leaning toward ordinary folks in your congregation, not the wealthiest.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Peter says to the shepherds, me and all the pastors,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "Don't shepherd this flock for shameful gain.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Eagerly, do it eagerly, being examples to the flock."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   In other words, handle money in a way you'd like your people to handle it
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   with a view to showing the world that Christ is your supreme treasure.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And lastly, I plead with pastors to lead your people
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   to put in place a leadership structure of a plurality of elders,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   a council of elders, on which you, pastor, have one vote.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   You are a chief among equals in that you have the direction of the pulpit
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   and the leadership by the word of God, by persuasion,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   not by having veto power over everything your lay people say,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   not by maneuvering with organizational power.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So, Tony, I am so jealous for these things
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   because I'm jealous for the name of Christ.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   His name is blaspheme, Paul said.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Paul said, it's so interesting, Paul said,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   "The name of God is blaspheme because of you."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And what was he referring to?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   He said, "You abhor idols and you rob temples."
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   What was that? That was hypocrisy to the core.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Calling idols bad names and pretending to be real jealous for God's name
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   and all the while, what you really want is money.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   He said, "The Pharisees were lovers of money
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and thus the name of God is blaspheme among the Gentiles."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's what's happening today because of pastors who love money.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Oh, oh, for every pastor to be ready to cut off his hand
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   before he uses it to bring reproach on the name of Jesus by grasping for money.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
