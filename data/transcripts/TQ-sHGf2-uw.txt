[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980]   All right, Jesse, you're in control of the show for this holiday episode.
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.780]   You ask the questions you want to hear.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.260]   What do you want to hear about first?
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.260]   All right.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.260]   First question.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.860]   Who are your must read writers, both authors, journalists, and reporters that are still
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.860]   alive?
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.620]   How do you get notified when they produce content and how quickly do you get around
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.620]   to reading it?
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.740]   On a similar note, who are your favorite writers of all time?
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.980]   I mean, at this point, what I mainly do is read and reread Jane Patterson's "Eruption."
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.780]   It's a continuation of the Michael Crichton concept about a volcano book.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780]   Now, serious question.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.180]   I can't do must reads.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.180]   I can't do favorites.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.300]   I have a hard time rank ordering things I like.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.820]   I think there might even be a word for this.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.820]   I mean, I don't know what it is.
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.620]   I'm making up a word, ordophobia, from ordinal for ranking or ordering and phobia for fear
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.620]   of or dislike of.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.700]   I just have a real block with things I like trying to order them.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.220]   I've talked about this on the show before.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.060]   It was one of the reasons why I did not sign up for Facebook when Facebook became the first
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860]   social media platform to have wide scale adoption because early Facebook was built on lists.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.860]   Your profile was favorite books, favorite movies, favorite quotes, and I have ordophobia.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.540]   I can't do that, and so I don't want to bother with this.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.540]   There is, however, I think something deeper in this question, which is deeply applicable,
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.780]   which is this idea of how do you figure out when and not you like have something to read?
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.780]   Are you on list?
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140]   Did you get notifications?
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.300]   How do you know when there's something out that you might want to read?
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.500]   And here, I want to maybe offer a mindset shift for the listener.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.940]   There's two ways to think about the reading life, the life where you read lots of books
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.700]   and articles, etc.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.460]   One way is more of the negative avoidance approach, which is, I'm afraid of missing
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.420]   something good.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.220]   There's something out there that's good that I would like or I should read, but I missed
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.220]   it.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.140]   There's a fear of missing out approach to it.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.340]   The flip side of that mindset is the joy and serendipity of, I found something good to
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340]   read.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.340]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.300]   I think a long time ago, I realized in the world of nonfiction, which is primarily the
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.060]   world in which I do most of my reading, there's more good authors and more books I'm ever
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.860]   going to read.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.700]   Instead of seeing that as a downside, I'm going to miss all this great stuff.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.080]   I see it as this positive side.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.620]   It's never going to be hard to find something that's going to delight me.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.300]   There's so much stuff out there that's good.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.140]   The joy or the benefit is in constantly finding stuff you like that's interesting, that challenges
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140]   you.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.740]   With that in mind, I'm not super specific in how I find what I'm going to read.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.740]   I hear about things.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.740]   I see things.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.740]   I'll walk through bookstores.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.020]   I was just at People's Book yesterday here in Tacoma Park, just looking at the new book
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.020]   tables.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.500]   "Hey, who has something new out that I might want to hear about?"
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   People mention things online.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   I read book reviews.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.460]   I'll read the New York Times book review.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.260]   I'll see what books the Wall Street Journal is reviewing, especially in the business space.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.860]   They're pretty good on that.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.060]   I'll see authors come up in podcasts.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.060]   I've said this before.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.860]   When it comes to interview podcasts, I follow guest, not host.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.100]   There might be a huge number of interview podcasts that I might scroll through and see
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.940]   what's on, not because I will listen to whatever they do, but to see if they have someone on
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.460]   that I'm interested in.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.220]   I might hear an interesting author come up on a friend of mine's show or something like
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.420]   this and then listen to it and say, "Oh, that sounds fascinating.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.420]   Okay.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.580]   Maybe I want to read that book."
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.820]   I have a pretty big library.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.780]   I'll just wander through my library and say, "Oh, here's a book in here.
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.940]   I picked up at some point meaning to read.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.100]   I didn't get around to it.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.060]   Now it's really appealing to me.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.500]   Let's rock and roll with it."
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.260]   I don't sweat missing stuff that's good.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.940]   There's so much good stuff out there that I'm not worried about not having something
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.580]   to read.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.260]   That being said, there's authors I really like.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.340]   I'm often looking for a combination of an author I like and a topic I like.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.500]   If it's not both, I might skip it.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   I don't know.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.700]   To be specific, I've long liked Sebastian Junger.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.200]   His adventure nonfiction, realistic nonfiction book was, of course, world class beginning
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.140]   with The Perfect Storm.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.740]   Then he switched over in the last decade or so to more of these smaller cultural critique
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.660]   type books, which tend to be about mismatches in human wiring in modern society.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.940]   I really like Tribe.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.480]   I really like Freedom.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.460]   If I see Junger has a book out and he has some sort of interesting cultural critique
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.500]   about these mismatches, I'm going to be on board.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.900]   But he had a recent book out that was his Reflections on Mortality and Dying and I didn't
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900]   pick that one up.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.260]   I was like, "I like this author, but I'm not really into that topic right now, so that
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.860]   combination is not catching my attention."
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.900]   It was like this with David McCullough, who was one of my favorite historical nonfiction
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.020]   writers, if not my favorite historical nonfiction writer.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.980]   His style is fantastic.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.820]   He's the master of taking the archived written word, typically in correspondence, and using
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.580]   this to recreate in vivid detail realistic characters from history.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.600]   So he brings people alive by using their own written words.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.860]   So if I see him, plus a historical time or topic I'm interested in, I was all on board.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.900]   But if it was him and not a topic or area I was interested in, I might skip it.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.600]   Like I didn't read his book about Americans in Paris.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.400]   It just wasn't as interesting to me as his sort of presidential books or colonial era
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   books.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   So that's the way I do this.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   And sometimes I won't know anything about the author, but the idea seems so interesting,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640]   I'll say, "Let's give this a try."
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.760]   I'm reading right now this fantastic, crazy book.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.320]   It might be the only book this guy ever wrote.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.480]   And he's basically recreating mathematics—I've mentioned this before, Jesse—but he builds
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.840]   from scratch mathematics from first principles in a way that's more conversational but motivated.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.520]   So he doesn't just say, "Here's how you take a derivative of a polynomial."
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   He works from first principles.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.000]   How would you take a derivative of a polynomial?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.920]   He derives all the stuff you learn in math class all the way through multidimensional
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.240]   calculus, including trigonometry, all the major rules of algebra.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.240]   It's a crazy book.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   It's fantastic.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   And it's weird and brilliant.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   I don't think anyone even knew about it.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.600]   And it sort of disappeared.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.440]   And that was just topic first, and I didn't know anything about this author.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   So I don't know.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   I love books.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.360]   I love nonfiction books.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.400]   There's no shortage of good books to read.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.680]   You'll miss most of the good books.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.840]   And the way I see it is that's OK.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.400]   What's the name of that math book?
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   Burn Math Class.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.720]   Bad title, right?
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.120]   Burn Math Class, a weird—you know, it was on a smaller press.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   I'll talk about it.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.760]   I'm not done with it yet, so I guess it'll end up on the January book list.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.520]   So you have two copies of that, right?
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   I lost the first one.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   I have it.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   Oh, you have it.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   I bought another one.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.040]   Yeah, I've been reading it, and I forgot to return it.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   I looked for it.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   I was like, "Ah, whatever.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   I'll just buy another one."
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   That's a cool book.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   It's a cool book.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.520]   I'm in Multivariable Calculus, which, you know, I took.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.040]   I used to be good at, but I don't remember.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.640]   But he derives it all from scratch.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   And it's all done in LaTeX.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.600]   I mean, only, like, math and science people know this, but he clearly wrote the whole
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.880]   book using the layout software we use for scientific papers.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.140]   So it's not even formatted—it wasn't reformatted for book format.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.600]   He just wrote it with the same software you use to write a math paper.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.920]   It's a cool book, though.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.160]   I mean, crazy, but I wish more people would write crazy books like that.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.720]   Needs a better title, needs a better cover.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.440]   Maybe we should buy the rights for it and, like, re-release it.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.200]   Remember, like, Ferris was doing that for—I don't know if you remember this.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.800]   Years ago, Tim Ferris was doing this.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.520]   He was like, "I'm going to buy the rights for books I really like."
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   He would buy, like, the audio rights and re-record them and publish them and use his platform
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   to help push them.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.480]   And then he realized, "Okay, that's, like, a really low-margin business."
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   But it was cool.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480]   He was buying rights for a while.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.880]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:51.360]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.800]   This is, like, the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.160]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.960]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   Check it out.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   All right.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   What's your second question?
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   All right.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   Next question.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.640]   "Writing is a big part of your life.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.800]   When you compare your writing to your favorite writers, do you think their level is achievable?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.080]   Or is it similar to your MIT experience with certain folks having extreme brain horsepower?"
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   It's a good question and a tough question.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.500]   To give context for the listener, I've talked about this with theoretical computer science,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.760]   my primary academic field or my original academic field, that there were differences.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   It was very hard work to get better, but there was some point where I realized I'm not at
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:48.380]   my 100%, because to get to your 100% is very difficult just in terms of the sheer intensity
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.780]   of work required.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.920]   But I realized my 100% was going to fall short of the greats in the field.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.760]   And there's an epsilon between, you know—so if you can't be a great, the difference between
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.800]   being, like, very good and good was somewhat diminishing returns.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.820]   I mean, I had a professorship at a good university, it's respected my field, easily got my promotions.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.080]   And so I at some point was thinking to go all in on getting to my 100%, which basically
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.480]   in theoretical computer science means you've got to read a lot more papers.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.680]   That sounds casual, but it's actually very hard to read and understand a theory paper,
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.720]   because it's complex math that's summarized, and you have to reconstruct complicated math
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   from scratch.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.560]   It just really is like an all-out intellectual effort.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.460]   It can take days and days just to understand one paper, and you've got to do that all the
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.460]   time.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.040]   And if you do that all the time, you can get yourself to 100%.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.360]   I still think it would have been short of the very top people, and so I pulled back
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   from trying to go 100%.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   Writing?
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   That's a good question.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.760]   I'm probably better at nonfiction writing, nationally speaking, I guess, than theoretical
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.760]   computer science.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   I guess.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.040]   So maybe I'll start there.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.880]   I mean, I'm a good theoretician, right?
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.560]   I mean, I trained at the top theory group.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.160]   It was the MIT's theory group was a good group.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.720]   I have a good professorship.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.760]   I have a good H-index.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.840]   I have a lot of citations.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.500]   But it's a smaller group of people to compare yourself against.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.560]   There's more nonfiction writers.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.680]   I just guess the reason why I say that is my national reputation as a nonfiction writer
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.560]   is probably better.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.080]   And some of the accolades of nonfiction writing, like writing for The New Yorker, maybe that's
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.240]   in academia.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.220]   Maybe that's the equivalent of having a position at a top 10 CS program, right?
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.400]   The New York Times bestsellers, the award list, maybe that's the academic equivalent
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:49.000]   of—though I've won some awards for my academic work, but winning some more higher-level awards,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.520]   being in the—your work showed up in science and not just in the journal that's specific
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   to your field.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:02.320]   So I think I'm a little better, nationally speaking, in nonfiction than I am in theory.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.120]   But I'm not one of the best nonfiction writers, right?
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.360]   I'm not writing features for The New Yorker in the magazine.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.480]   I'm not up for national book awards or Pulitzers, right?
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.760]   I mean, I'm not at that echelon of, from a craft perspective, just the very best writers.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.800]   I make best-of-the-year lists, but typically places that are considering business books
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.960]   or considering pragmatic nonfiction, whereas The New York Times is top 100, that's not
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.080]   a place I'm going to show up.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.880]   I'm not going to show up in The New Yorker's best books of the year.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.320]   So in theory, there's higher craft I could get to.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.100]   I don't know how high I would get if I pushed for 100% in writing.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.680]   I think, just like in CS, I'm at that 75%, which took a decade to get here.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.960]   It took really hard work, don't get me wrong.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.720]   But to write the very best writing I could do, I would really need to do it full-time
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   all out to get to that 100%, and I don't know where that would land.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   One of the reasons why I'm not doing that, as long as we're psychoanalyzing my career
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.880]   decisions here, which is interesting to me.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:07.080]   One of the reasons I'm not doing that is that it might not be the most productive thing
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.480]   for me to do from a career success or impacts perspective, right?
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:18.080]   Like, really, my skill, the thing I think that I have that's more unique or my unique
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.000]   advantage is actually idea generation.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.520]   I'm an idea generator.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.920]   I can make sense of information and come up with interesting ways to think about things.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.040]   I'm very good at consolidating things into interesting ideas and frameworks.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.160]   I've always been good at this.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   I just sort of see the world this way.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.560]   That's well-served by my current writing ability.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.320]   Like, I'm a pretty good writer, which means when I write about idea stuff, it has a little
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.160]   bit of a gloss of it being maybe a little bit smarter than, like, a standard advice
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.520]   or self-help, but not off-the-charts, like, literary nonfiction.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.320]   And that's probably, like, the right place, right, this sort of smart self-help balance
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:05.080]   I've found, where I have ideas that can give you specific action, but I'm writing about
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.120]   it more New Yorker-y style, like, smarter than you would get in just a standard advice
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.920]   book that you would pick up.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.720]   That seems to be, like, a combination, that's a lane I've created, which I think is a good
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   lane.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.120]   So actually becoming better at nonfiction writing wouldn't help that lane.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.240]   Personally, though, I'm interested in continuing to grow my craft.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.480]   So man, this is an interesting question, Jesse.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.360]   This is, like, an interesting discussion that you could have in general when talking about
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.880]   achievement, is that gap between 75% of your capacity and 100%, because there is a huge
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.640]   effort differential between 75% and 100%.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.040]   And it's a calculus that in any sort of high-achieving field you have to do.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.480]   Is my 100% going to justify that effort differential or not?
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.520]   And it's a complicated question, because your 100% is where you land on that hierarchy of
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.560]   skills, and, like, most people's 100% doesn't land at the top.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.360]   And so often, like, your 75%, which again is very hard, you have to focus and it takes
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.680]   decades, but your 75% is often the right strategy with high achievement.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.960]   You're getting the most bang for your buck.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.120]   It's a complicated topic that I don't think we discuss with enough complexity in our culture
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   in general.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   So I don't know.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.400]   Maybe I-- let me summarize it.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.320]   I could probably be a little bit better at writing, but I don't know how much better.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.040]   So in the time being, like, in the next 10 years, you'll hopefully be a better writer
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.080]   than you are now, right?
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.240]   But I will get better.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   The question is, like--
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   Is it like baseball?
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.680]   Like, I keep on asking you this, is there-- eventually, you kind of go through your prime?
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.840]   I-- it's a-- yeah, it's a hard question.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   I don't know.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   Probably.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:54.520]   See, the thing about baseball-- and my former late editor, who edited So Good They Can't
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:01.520]   Ignore You, and actually, tragically, died a couple of years ago, he used to tell me
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.360]   this because he was a professional baseball player.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.800]   Didn't make it to the majors, but was in the professional minor league systems.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.520]   And the thing is, he said, in baseball, everyone is gunning for their 100%, to use my analogy.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.800]   So everyone is doing all the training you can possibly do to maximize your potential.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.240]   So everything just eventually sorts out.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.800]   And I'm a single A player, I'm an instructional league player, I'm a double A player, maybe
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.440]   I'm like a triple A or quadruple A style utility player, or I'm a major leaguer, or I'm an
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   all-star.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.640]   And you're going to fall somewhere on that scale, and you're going to know it by, like,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   27.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.600]   Because everyone is going all out.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.800]   And so you're probably not going to have-- changes happen.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.600]   Like, obviously, you'll get in the weeds, you'll get a sort of mid-career Daniel Murphy
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.800]   changes his swing to be more launch angle, and suddenly becomes one of the best hitters
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.720]   in baseball.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.200]   But for the most part, it kind of shakes out.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.240]   Most other non-athletic fields, people don't push it that far.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.480]   And so what I'm trying to figure out is, is your 75% sort of indicate, hey, if my 75%
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.340]   is this good, then I just add this much to get what my 100% would be, or is it a completely
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.340]   different game?
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.140]   Like, maybe in writing, like nonfiction writing, if you're a pretty good writer and you go
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.400]   all out, you can get great.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   Maybe anyone can do it.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   I just don't know.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   You know?
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.920]   A lot of what makes great nonfiction writing great tends to be on the research side.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.040]   And that's something that's pretty replicatable.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:34.200]   It's just time, it's, you know, OK, what makes a David Graham long-form piece for The New
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   Yorker good?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.040]   So you have David Graham, who wrote Killers of the Flower Moon, and what makes his long-form
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   pieces good?
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:47.640]   He spends a huge amount of time just immersing himself in the topic and the people, and he
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   just follows them, and he gets all these notes, and he goes into the archives, and he spends
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.520]   all these times and reads all these things and just immerses himself in that world.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.640]   Typically puts himself into some sort of adventure as well.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.880]   He brings those two things together.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.000]   That's just like a lot of time, right?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.920]   Like often what differentiates like a great nonfiction writer from a good nonfiction writer
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.760]   is like they're willing to do the time.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.880]   They're willing to use the Robert Caro term, turn every page in the archive.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.480]   Like I'm going to read everything.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.040]   I'm going to just sit and craft.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.480]   Ronan Farrow was great at this.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:22.640]   Like I'm just going to, like a bulldog, cultivate these sources and just get and go and get
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   and go.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.680]   And some of that is a time game.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.720]   Some of that is an instinct game, but I don't know.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.800]   That's what I think is different about athletics and writing is that like if you're willing
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.640]   to put in the time, yeah, it's like a pain tolerance thing.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.240]   I am willing to spend five years on this.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.160]   It's going to be a better book than if you spend two.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.440]   But at some point, you're right, it's got to level out.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.440]   Like just your instinct for the written word and rhythm, it's just, it's going to, your
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.080]   quality will land where it will land.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.040]   But I mean, you can have huge successes like Walter Isaacson.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.840]   He puts in the time.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.200]   It's not that his writing style is, there's something magnificent about it.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.440]   He just, it's, he's just super clear.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.400]   He does the work, he goes to the archives, he gets the important information, he sees
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.920]   the through lines are important and he writes with a real clarity, which is like a little
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.640]   bit different than David McCullough, who had like a real skill for capturing the essence
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.840]   of a historical figure using the written word, quoting the right things.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.560]   Like he had this super empathetic brain that could inhabit the brain of the subject by
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.080]   just reading everything that person had written and he kind of understands what gets to the
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.280]   core of that person and what they're thinking and then can pick out those examples.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.240]   And like there's just like a real skill in there.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   So I don't know.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   It's a great question.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   I struggle with.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.880]   All right, what do we got?
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.200]   Next question.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.760]   When do you fit in your writing blocks for academic papers?
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   Do these replace your morning blocks for book and article writing?
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.840]   I mean, nowadays, writing is writing, like that's my main intellectual activity is producing
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.920]   words on paper that other people are going to find interesting, important or impactful.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.040]   And so whether it's a book or a New Yorker article or an academic article, I just want
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   to write.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   I write every morning and then I schedule more writing blocks if I need it, depending
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.560]   on what's going on.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.080]   And what happens in those blocks just depends on what I'm working on.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.480]   So if I'm heavy in book mode, those will be book blocks.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.840]   If I'm crunching a deadline for an academic paper, then those will be academic blocks.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   Sometimes I'll mix them.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   I try not to.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.040]   I'm a big believer in milestones.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   So if I have a huge project like writing a book that I have like a New Yorker piece,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   I want to write.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.860]   I just milestone things like, great, let me get to this milestone on the book, finishing
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.480]   a draft of this chapter, then I can put that aside and move to like this New Yorker piece.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   So what's my milestone there?
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   Full rough draft.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   I get to my editor.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.560]   So I'm all in on that till I get to that milestone.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.640]   Now I'm going to hear back from my editor.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.280]   I go back and say, my milestone for the book is going to be like a full editing pass to
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   this chapter.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.360]   And like, that's what I'll work on for four or five days.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.760]   OK, now I'm going back.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.800]   So I milestone my work and the things that can happen within like roughly a week.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.200]   And so I'm not switching.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.400]   I try not to switch back and forth within the same day.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   But I also just don't differentiate that much anymore like I used to.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.720]   I mean, it used to be when I was struggling for computer science promotions, like that's
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.100]   what I was focused on.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.640]   It was, I have to make sure I'm publishing this many academic papers.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640]   All right.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.920]   Now I have like my book writing and I got to figure out like when I'm going to take
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   on book contracts and like when I'm going to do that book writing.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   And these are two very separate things.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.200]   Now it's all mixed together for me.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.840]   I just think writing is writing is writing.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.540]   I try to do as much as possible.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.040]   Sometimes a year I'm doing more than others.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.000]   I milestone so I can be monofocused on one thing at any given day.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400]   It probably, it feels slower in the moment.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.460]   That's one of my ideas for my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.840]   Over time it produces just as much.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   I didn't write today actually.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   So.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   Well, you had a doctor's appointment.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   I had a doctor's appointment.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   So.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.720]   So will you write this afternoon?
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.160]   I had to take, today is a nonwriting day because I have a meeting after this and a board meeting
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.160]   tonight.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.120]   And so I had to mentally, I had to mentally prepare myself yesterday that just this is
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.240]   a nonwriting day because otherwise I get so frustrated that I'm not writing.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.200]   A break, a Christmas break can be rough for me.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.560]   I got to get writing in or I get really antsy.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.120]   It's the, this might, someone took away my cigarettes type of thing.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.840]   All right.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.200]   Next question.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.120]   What steps do you take when completely stuck on a project?
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.960]   For example, if you optimize a project for many months and have seen only minimal improvement
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.520]   in minor metrics, but the overall goal isn't getting any closer.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.440]   You know, I was just talking about this on an interview I was recording last night for
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.040]   someone else's podcast.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   They were asking about this, you know, sticking with a project for a long amount of time has
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.600]   all these advantages I write about in slow productivity, like stuff that's cool takes
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.880]   time and you got to stay focused on it for a long amount of time.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.200]   And they were wondering about, but what if it's not going well?
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.880]   You know, if you're thinking it's going to take five years for me to get good at something,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.400]   what happens if after four years, it turns out that's not your thing, right?
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.920]   If you wasted four years.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.200]   So I was thinking about this problem and a book came to mind.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.920]   I remember reading this book.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.040]   This probably would have been, if I had to guess, 2007, maybe it was 2009, but I think
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   this was 2007.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   I don't have a photographic memory, but I have a memory for books.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.240]   Just for whatever reason, I can remember where I am when I've read most books.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.120]   And I read this book in the airport.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:24.040]   We were flying to a trip to Argentina and I was reading this book in, I think, George
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.320]   Bush International Airport in Texas where we were connecting for the flight.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.280]   Seth Godin's book, The Dip, gets at this exact issue.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.240]   He says, okay, here's the cool thing, or not cool thing, the critical question when you're
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.800]   working on a long-term important project.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.680]   When things start to go poorly, like you stop making progress or opportunities are not emerging
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.280]   or you feel stuck, how do you tell the difference between being in what he calls a dip, which
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.960]   means you want to make it through this dip and on the other side, you're going to keep
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   going up.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   How do you tell the difference between a dip and a cul-de-sac?
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.360]   Cul-de-sac means that you're just done, you're just stuck and what you need to do is quit
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.200]   and this is not working, you need to do something else.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:08.360]   And I think he correctly points out differentiating between dips and cul-de-sacs is the key to
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.240]   tackling a type of long-term projects that ultimately you can build really cool lives
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   on top of.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.120]   The problem is, I don't remember that book giving really solid technical advice for how
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   you make that differentiation.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   It was more like he was saying this matters, there's a difference, it was giving you vocabulary.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.440]   Figuring out how to tell the difference is one of the key under-discussed elements of
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.040]   long-term performance.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.400]   So what I said on this podcast interview I was doing last night is you want to look for
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.200]   indications of progress.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.040]   Sometimes this is a skill, I'm trying to get better at something so I can just get the
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.800]   indication I'm getting better at this skill.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.720]   Sometimes the indications have to come from the opportunities that are being afforded
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   you on the other side.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.120]   You're getting more offers or opportunities or more clients or more incoming.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.560]   So it could be your internal skill that you can measure as getting better or your external
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.800]   value is being validated as getting better.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.520]   But you're looking for these indicators of progress.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:08.320]   If they're stuck for a non-trivial amount of time, you need to rethink process.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.800]   All right, let me go back and rethink process.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.760]   How am I trying to get better?
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.960]   So I'm a writer trying to get better, I'm kind of stuck, I'm just now, I'm writing this
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.360]   newsletter, the numbers are low, the numbers are stuck, nothing else is happening.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.520]   I need to go back to the drawing board and rethink the process I'm using to try to get
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   better.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.320]   That's the first thing to do.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.280]   Rethink your process has to happen from an evidence-based perspective.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:37.160]   It is very tempting when working on long-term projects to write a story about what you want
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.040]   to be true, about what's important for getting better here.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.200]   This is what I want to be true, that if I just keep writing this substack and I do it
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.960]   every week and I'm very careful about putting screenshots of the essay on Twitter in the
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.120]   optimized form after they come out and I do all the social media stuff right, that eventually
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.040]   something will click and this will take off and I'll make a full-time living off it.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.680]   We tell ourselves stories about what we want to be true.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.320]   But the reality could be very different, and you might get a completely different story
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.560]   from reality where it says, "Well, wait a second.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.800]   Writing a substack where you don't already have a reputation in a subject is not going
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   to do anything.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.040]   All you need to do is try to build up a footprint in the journalistic world on way to getting
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.560]   a book, and this is difficult because you've got to make pitches and they're going to get
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.880]   rejected and it's going to be hard work, and you don't want it to be true, but it is."
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.520]   So you have to go back and get evidence.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.700]   What really works in this pursuit I'm doing?
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.120]   Talk to people who know, and then upgrade your process or update your process to reflect
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.360]   this reality.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.040]   If this still doesn't return results, like, "Okay, I'm doing the things that you're supposed
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.920]   to do, I was reality checked, here's how people make progress in this world," and you're still
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.080]   not getting indicators of progress, that's your sign you might be in a cul-de-sac and
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.800]   you need to change the map of where you're going.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.400]   Maybe it's a small change or maybe it's a drastic change, like, "I'm just not going to
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.340]   go this way in general."
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.640]   So I have seen this a lot.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.320]   I become more attuned to this in the things that I do that have been relatively successful.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.680]   I have become attuned to the degree to which there's a survivorship bias, in which it's
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.720]   easy to say, "Okay, here's what I did, so if you just do that, you'll be fine."
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.880]   I've realized over time, no, no, some of these things are really hard, and you don't want
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.520]   to get stuck in a cul-de-sac because most people will.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.880]   So let's consider book writing.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.740]   I used to always tell people, "Yeah, write books.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.440]   It's not so hard.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.920]   It's not too hard to sell a book, and then you'll build up your audience, and it's really
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.480]   cool, and it wasn't that hard.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   Everyone should write books."
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.040]   Then over time, I realized, no, no, there's some survivorship bias there.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.260]   It's hard to sell a book.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.420]   It's really hard to get a book to actually sell to people.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.420]   There's luck.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.420]   There's timing.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   There's topic.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.420]   There's skill.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:51.720]   For most people who go down the writing path, you're going to get stuck pretty quickly.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.440]   Same thing with podcasting.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.680]   It's easy to say, "This is not technically that hard, what we do here.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.360]   I could tell you what we do here, and here's what it requires, and technically here's what
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.360]   we do week to week."
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.700]   But I've realized, "Oh, it's really hard to have a podcast be successful," and it depends
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:14.020]   on lots of things, including, I've discovered, having a national reputation or brand outside
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.480]   of what you're doing with the podcast.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.920]   You have a built-in audience.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.480]   You have a built-in trust or social validation that you're someone that people should listen
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   to.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   All this is really hard.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.400]   Actually, like most people I know who have tried podcasts, it's just kind of dead-ended.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.480]   They technically did all the right things.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   There's just no audience coming.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.640]   There's no obvious thing to do to make that audience bigger.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.480]   It's like, "Oh, this is a difficult path to thread," and actually, it's not going to work
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.000]   for most people, and you don't want to waste too many years trying to follow it.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.480]   I've become more attuned to this recently, that you want to look for indicators of progress.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.600]   You need evidence-based plans for this.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.500]   You can update your plan with new evidence if it's not working.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:58.160]   If it's still not working after that, then it might be a cul-de-sac, not a dip.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.160]   You want to consider putting your efforts towards something that's more likely to succeed
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:06.680]   for you, where you're building off of, "I have this pre-existing ability or platform.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.280]   I already have this credential that makes it much more likely I'll succeed going this
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   path.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.440]   You might need to reality check the path."
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.200]   I've become more curmudgeonly about this, Jesse, about general stuff.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.320]   I used to be like, "Everyone should just do everything I'm doing.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   It's fine."
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:24.860]   But now I've been recognized, I've been very selective, and I've really leveraged pre-existing
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.900]   cultural assets to try to make other things successful.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.020]   It's a lot more fragile and contingent than maybe I would have realized before.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.620]   Okay, next question.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:41.940]   What criteria do many high school students fail to consider when selecting a college?
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.380]   On a related note, do you think tuition costs for private schools will exceed $150,000 per
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.340]   year in, say, 15 years?
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:56.260]   I think students, in the American context, and this is very different than other countries
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.420]   where higher education is largely free.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.500]   In the American context, I think students probably overemphasize fit.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.860]   It's a uniquely American thing that, "I want this to feel of the college to be right,"
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:14.460]   which often means physically what it feels like, where it is in the country, what the
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.260]   buildings feel like, etc.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.740]   It probably makes sense.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.900]   The strategy that probably makes sense for most people is, go to your state school.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.020]   That's going to be the best bang for your buck, unless you can get into a really elite
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.160]   school that can open up substantially more opportunities because of its eliteness.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.260]   But avoid that big middle ground of non-elite schools that are very expensive that you're
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.620]   shopping on fit.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.120]   It's probably not a great investment in money.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.500]   That's probably the best strategy.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:48.760]   Go to state school, unless you can get into a Georgetown or better or something like this.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.500]   There are, of course, schools where fit really matters.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.700]   If you're a super math whiz, try to go to MIT.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.700]   It's great for that.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.380]   If you're a music whiz, you really want to try to go to Juilliard.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:04.220]   If you're film savant, you can get into USC, you should go to USC.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.380]   But for the most part, we probably think too much about, "Is this a fit for me?"
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.580]   Because honestly, what does a 17-year-old know?
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.020]   What are they basing this decision off of?
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.980]   They had a good visit to a school, they met someone nice, like, "Great.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.980]   That's where I want to go."
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.540]   The cost thing, I hope it doesn't get to $150,000.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.100]   I hope tuition doesn't get there.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:30.020]   I think there's going to be some emergent reverse pressure on tuition prices in schools
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.060]   as more alternatives.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.900]   There's some alternatives that are emerging, independent schools like the University of
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.900]   Austin.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.220]   Barry Weiss is set up down there in Texas.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.340]   There's some of these other options that are emerging, which might start to put some pressure
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.420]   on runaway costs, because there's going to be these alternatives that emerge that have
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.940]   more constrained costs.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.540]   There's a kind of a tragedy of the commons that goes on now, where just all schools increase
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.780]   their cost.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.860]   All these private schools, like, "Well, as long as we all do it, it's fine because you
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.860]   have no other option.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.860]   It's all very expensive."
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:08.820]   Hopefully, there's some sort of capped pressure that comes in to prevent it from getting bigger.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.780]   I say this as a father of three kids who are going to have to go to college.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:18.380]   The only advantage I have of private school getting more expensive is, as a professor,
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:26.580]   I have a tuition benefit, which is key to the cost of Georgetown's current tuition.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:31.380]   They will pay a certain percentage of Georgetown's tuition towards any school that my kids go
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.180]   to.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.460]   As it stands now, because private schools are so expensive, a third or whatever the
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:43.500]   percentages of Georgetown's tuition is all of the University of Maryland's tuition.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:49.900]   The best case scenario is Maryland keeps its prices low, and then Georgetown gets really
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.900]   expensive.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   In fact, if Georgetown can get like five times more expensive than any other college, I'm
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   set.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.020]   It's my tuition benefit, because I'll be able to cover anything else.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   But yeah, it's big.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.220]   The gap between state and private is getting big as well.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.580]   States have done pretty well.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.060]   Most places are keeping the cost kind of reasonable.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.980]   But now you have this big gap that's opening, which we're noticing as we're doing college
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.980]   savings.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:17.060]   Because if you save for a state university, but your kid, like in a 529, but your kid
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.520]   wants to go to a private university, you don't have nearly enough money.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.940]   But if you're saving in a tax-advantaged account, like a 529 for a private university, and your
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.200]   kid goes to a state university, you've way over-saved, and you have too much money in
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.140]   that account, and you're going to have to pay penalties to get out.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.340]   So that gap is kind of complicated when it comes to tuition saving.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.020]   I guess it would somewhat vary, too, in terms of selection process if you're being recruited
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.540]   to play a sport.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.540]   Yep.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.380]   Sport's its own thing, obviously, right?
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.780]   You're deciding what team you want to play for.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.980]   Yeah, same thing.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.620]   This is mentioning specific things.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.500]   I'm a violin whiz.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.740]   You want to go to Juilliard, et cetera.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   So we'll see.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.580]   I still got some time before I have to worry about it.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.060]   I wrote a book about college admissions.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.740]   My least known book.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.740]   But it is out there.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.140]   So I used to know a lot about this.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.580]   Jesse, I figure we should do a quick ad break before we keep going with Jesse Takeover.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.300]   I want to talk first about our now becoming a longtime sponsor, because it's a product
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.980]   I really like, and that is our friends at Notion.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.320]   You've heard me talk about Notion before.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.920]   It's a tool that helps you combine your notes, docs, and projects into one space that's simple
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.520]   and beautifully designed.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.220]   We have worked with various Notion systems throughout our time here on the podcast, and
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.540]   it's always been a great time saver.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.800]   You can build these custom systems for accessing and viewing your information.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.920]   You know, I'm a big process guy.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.720]   Notion lets you build your own information systems for whatever processes you're using.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.980]   So whether you're talking about organizing your own tasks or the whole information flow
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.080]   of a business, Notion can help you do it.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.120]   What I want to talk about today is they have been integrating AI into their tool in a way
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.900]   that I think is very commendable.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.740]   You know, right now, when people think about the current crop of AI tools, they think about
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.660]   having to switch back and forth from like this program they're using over to the AI
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:14.740]   tool and maybe copy something into a text box, and they get an answer and go back to
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.140]   the tool they're using.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.460]   Not Notion.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:22.920]   It combines AI right into their system.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.860]   Notion AI helps you work faster, write better, think bigger, and do tasks that normally take
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.580]   you hours and seconds, all without having to jump out of the Notion ecosystem and come
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.660]   back to it.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.220]   It is all integrated.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:38.380]   You can leverage this power across all of your notes and docs without having to switch
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.700]   to something different.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.460]   So Notion AI can help you do things like write a first draft of something that you're working
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.960]   on, jumpstart a brainstorm, turn your messy notes into something polished.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.420]   It can even, and this is what I really like about where they're going with this, can help
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:00.220]   you automate tedious tasks like summarizing, meeting notes or finding next steps.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.660]   Notion is used by over half of Fortune 500 companies because again, it makes it easy
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.780]   to have custom data based systems that do exactly what you want and with AI, it's become
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   even more useful.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:16.900]   So you can try Notion for free when you go to notion.com/cal, type that in all lowercase
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:22.180]   letters, notion.com/cal to try the powerful, easy to use Notion AI today.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.420]   When you use our link, you'll be supporting our show.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.140]   That's notion.com/cal.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.380]   Also want to talk about our longtime friends at Blinkist.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.840]   Blinkist is an app that gives you over 6,500 book summaries and expert led audio guides
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.420]   to read and listen to in just 15 minutes per title.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:46.900]   You can access best in class, actionable knowledge from 27 categories such as productivity, psychology
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.260]   and more on the go and get entertained at the same time.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.220]   The way Jesse and I like to use Blinkist is to triage potential books to read.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.880]   If we hear about a book we might be interested in, we'll add it to our queue and we get around
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   to it.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.860]   We'll either read the 15 minute summary, you know, right there on our phone or listen to
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.160]   the 15 minute summary like you would a podcast.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.780]   It does a great job of letting you understand what a book is about and I find it really
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.660]   helps me decide whether I want to read the whole book or if I've got enough, I get it.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.660]   I get the gist.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.660]   Like I get where you're going here.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.380]   I don't need to read a whole book about this.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.820]   So it's a fantastic tool for triaging what books you read.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.580]   Other people use it as just straight entertainment.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.340]   It's like an interesting podcast to learn about different topics.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:35.420]   A lot of ways to use Blinkist, but it is a must have companion to the reading life.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.960]   One new feature to offer, they have this program called Blinkist Connect that allows you to
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.000]   give another person unlimited access for free.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.640]   So it's basically two for one.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.340]   That's a cool thing that's going on now.

[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.960]   Jesse, maybe we should wear these blinking lights every time we do a Blinkist ad.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.080]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.700]   It could start a bad precedent though, that like every advertiser would now want us to
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.680]   have a physical prop, but hey, we're up for it.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   We're up for it.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   All right, let's get back to the questions.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.320]   All right, next question.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.700]   Can you walk us through your shutdown ritual?
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.700]   How long does it take?
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.120]   Has there ever been a workday where you missed it?
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.440]   Are there significant consequences if that happens?
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.400]   So okay, when I'm done with work for the day, I open my first of what will be several handles
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.240]   of whiskey and I just start pounding.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.720]   I start pounding until the pain goes away.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.320]   No, that's not my shutdown ritual.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:05.620]   So what I do for my shutdown ritual is I, first of all, clean up open loops.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.480]   So for me, these are going to be in two places.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.260]   One will be my workingmemory.txt file on my computer.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.520]   This is my expansion of my working memory.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.020]   I use this non-formatted text edit text file.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.880]   All throughout the day, I capture notes and ideas just to remember things temporarily
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   or more long-term.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.200]   Like, let's say I'm trying to schedule a meeting and someone emails me some options.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.160]   I'll just copy that and paste it into that file and then I'll open up my calendar and
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.840]   I have the file open up next to me and I can see what time works.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.440]   I keep impromptu to-do lists for admin blocks in here.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.800]   Okay, here's what I'm working on.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.420]   I take notes on things that occur to me.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.840]   So I make sure at the end of the day, there's nothing loose in that file that needs to be
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.360]   captured, that needs to be moved into my task storage system, that needs to be moved as
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.580]   a reminder onto my calendar, that needs to generate an email that I send out.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.520]   So I make sure those open loops are closed.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.880]   I usually then do a survey of my inbox as well, just to make sure there's not something
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.760]   time-sensitive I missed.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.160]   It's critical.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:11.720]   Doing a final check of your inbox before you shut down will destabilize one of the biggest
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.080]   post-shutdown sources of distraction, which is this urge to just sort of check in just
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.520]   to be sure that you're not missing something in your inbox.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.080]   So that final check is really important.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.220]   Then I'm going to look at my weekly plan, see if I need to update it at all.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.220]   What am I doing tomorrow?
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.320]   I look at my calendar, my weekly plan, what changes do I need to make about what I did
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.500]   or didn't get to today, so that I feel like my weekly plan is now at the end of this day
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   in a good place.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.420]   All right, it's up to speed where where it needs to be.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:46.620]   At that point, I'm ready to do my shutdown ritual, which now is typically going to just
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.860]   be in my time block planner where I have a shutdown complete checkbox, and I just check
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860]   that.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.820]   Now I know I've done my shutdown ritual.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:58.540]   If I've done that, I can get into my evening without work stress.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.340]   I can get into my evening without feeling like there's something in the back of my mind,
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.340]   like what about this?
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.340]   What about that?
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.420]   So it really does make a difference.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.760]   Sometimes as part of the shutdown ritual, I'll sketch out a plan for the evening.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.940]   If it's kind of a complicated evening, I need to pick up this kid, we're going to this thing,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   I want to get this done.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:18.380]   I'll sketch out a little plan, and I will look at the planner, I'll have it just so
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.520]   I can remember when I'm trying to get done that night after my shutdown.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.580]   But once I do that checkmark in the checkbox, I'm not thinking about work until the next
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.580]   day.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.220]   I do miss this sometimes.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:34.460]   The times when I miss this, it's not due to a day being so busy that I just don't get
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.180]   time to do it.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:42.220]   The times when I miss this is where the day is sort of hybrid, when the day is sort of
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.060]   kind of a workday, not really a workday.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.100]   I know a lot of people who go to an office don't have this experience, but for someone
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.340]   like me, I'm a professor, I'm a writer, it can get kind of hazy.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.620]   This time of year, it can get kind of hazy.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.940]   Semester's over, Christmas break's about to start, maybe I have to go to a doctor's appointment
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:06.620]   that morning, and I'm kind of working, but we're also going to pick up gifts, and it's
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.460]   sort of a workday, and it's sort of not a workday.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.580]   Those are the days where the shutdowns don't happen, and I suffer for it, and it's just
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.340]   this background hum of a little bit of destabilization and anxiety.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.340]   So it's the days I can get my shutdown routine, which is, I really don't like to miss it,
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.660]   and I'm not going to miss it on a normal full workday, that really makes a big difference.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.260]   So you pretty much work on the same computer all day, where your working memory is.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.740]   Yeah, so I have two working memory.txt files.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:40.660]   I have my laptop, that's the main computer I'll use, I have an external monitor at home
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:46.860]   that I'll plug it into, and then I have one here in the computers in the studio, in the
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.780]   maker lab here at the studio.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:55.420]   That one I use only in the moment, I will empty that when I'm done using that computer,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.780]   so I don't keep stuff on there.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:03.220]   So if I'm writing on that computer, I'm using the big monitors, I'll usually have my laptop.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.160]   I will copy stuff over to the working memory.txt on my laptop.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:11.980]   So I will use the working memory.txt on the studio computers, really temporarily.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.460]   Like I let me remember this while I go over to my calendar, let me type the five points
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.380]   I want to put in this thing I'm writing quotes, let me copy a quote, I'm going to move over
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.380]   here.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.120]   And then I clean that out when I walk away from the computer.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.820]   So it's really the file on my laptop that I treat as the sort of stable file.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.900]   And that's the one I want to be checking at the end of the day.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   Okay.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.900]   All right.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.900]   Next question.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.900]   Do you think about retirement?
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.180]   If so, is it dependent on financial or other factors?
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:41.480]   Would you still work some of your jobs past technical retirement?
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.860]   I mean, what does retirement mean for me?
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:51.380]   I have been thinking about this and my financial advisor asked me about this.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.940]   But it's complicated because I have a lot of jobs, right?
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:01.180]   So what does retirement, like, what would it actually mean from a job perspective?
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.300]   Does it mean stop being a professor?
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.620]   Does it mean stop being a magazine journalist?
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.060]   Does it mean stop being a podcaster?
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.880]   Does it mean stop writing books?
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.260]   Is it some subset of those, some combination of those?
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.580]   It's unlikely to ever mean for me to do none of those things.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:21.160]   Like why would I ever stop, for example, writing books if I could or, you know, magazine articles?
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.540]   So it's a very complicated thing for me.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.580]   And even like saying stop being a professor, it's not always so cut and dry.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:32.420]   Like there's professors have different setups, you know, it's, it's there.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   Some are just straightforward.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.740]   I'm in a standard department with a full teaching load doing the normal thing, but there's also
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.740]   professors out there.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.240]   You might not know it if you're not in academia, but like well-known professors where they
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.380]   have a title and they're associated with a center and they don't really draw much of
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.540]   a salary and maybe they have an office or not on campus, but they're, they're barely
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.540]   there.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.620]   So the word professor can mean many different things.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.580]   So it's all very complicated.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.780]   So what I've been focusing in on instead is the financial aspect and really like keeping
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:07.740]   things simple, looking at straightforward financial independence so that we have a very
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.940]   clear number.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:16.820]   This is how much we would need to sort of comfortably live per year.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.060]   Like we know that number pretty well because we're pretty careful in tracking our expenses.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.620]   And this is what that number is going to reduce to sort of post having kids at home, because
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.760]   that's a smaller number, but kids at home, you spend more money and you have to think
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   about college, et cetera.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.300]   So you have like, what would the number be tomorrow and what would the number be once
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.740]   the kids are gone, which is like a lower number.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.700]   Both of those we can translate into how many, how much assets would you have to have to
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:44.020]   basically feel comfortable withdrawing that much money annually?
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.500]   That's a big number, not a crazy number, but a big number.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.060]   That's a number I have in mind, right?
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:56.180]   If my next book does really well, there's some big influx of money.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.180]   That's what I'm putting that money towards, because the way I see it is the closer you
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.380]   get to that sort of financial independence, the more breathing room you have to pursue
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.580]   whatever definition of retirement seems interesting.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.100]   Because now you're not dependent on any of the things I'm doing as like an income source.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.700]   Now you can just start thinking, what do I think the ideal combination of work would
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.980]   be?
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.260]   And you could explore that without having to worry about, yeah, but my health insurance,
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.160]   or are we going to be able to pay for this or that or these expenses or whatever?
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.780]   So that's the way I've been thinking about it, is not I want to stop working, but the
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:38.140]   more financial independence I gain, the more comfortable I can be reconfiguring what work
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.700]   means, because the fear is not there.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.420]   And this is why I'd be a bad entrepreneur, I think, Jesse, is like I really have that
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:51.700]   mindset of I don't trust, I think of the worst case scenarios financially, I don't take risks.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.860]   I like overlapping sources of income.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.260]   I want stress reduction.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:01.660]   I think other people we know are much more aggressive about, hey, this thing's going
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.340]   well and it's cool.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.060]   Let's go all in on that.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.540]   And we'll probably figure it out.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.780]   Well, I don't like to just hope it works out.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.060]   So I'm probably way more conservative than other people would be.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.660]   And because of that, I have too many jobs and that's kind of a problem.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.340]   What does overlapping sources of income mean?
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.700]   So OK, like someone else's situation might say, hey, this podcast is doing well, just
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.460]   be a podcaster or you're a successful writer.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.220]   Just be a full time book writer.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.220]   It's fine.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.220]   You're doing well.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.220]   Right.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   Or, you know, whatever, wherever it would be.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:35.100]   Whereas I think of it as like, well, yeah, the podcast's doing well, but like, what if
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.380]   it stops doing well?
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.900]   Then you're screwed or like books is fickle.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.380]   It's like being a successful actor.
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:44.580]   You're a successful actor until you're not, until you make two bad movies and then you're
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.660]   no longer a successful actor.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.340]   It's like I'm always sort of catastrophizing.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.020]   Whereas my full time writer friends, for example, are like, you're crazy.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:56.300]   Like you're very, very successful as a writer, you know, way over the threshold that someone
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.260]   just like, great, I can just now write books.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.620]   Or other things where I'll be conservative would be a lot of people in my situation like,
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.620]   yeah, whatever.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:09.740]   I bought a farm up in, you know, Vermont or I have a cabin up in West Virginia.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   They don't overthink it.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   That'd be cool.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   It's a cool place to go.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.740]   And we spend the summers there and we write or whatever.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.660]   I'm in my head, the math doesn't cost this much.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.660]   What about this?
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.660]   And the stress of this and this and this.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.300]   And so I'm, I, I, I've always had this mindset of like, no one's going to save me.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.300]   I got it.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.660]   I'm supporting a family.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.660]   I want security.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.420]   I want, you know, I want to be able to weather multiple points of failure.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.260]   It's very sort of non-entrepreneurial.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.220]   Also the problem is I like all these things, right?
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:43.180]   Like Georgetown can be a pain in terms of work, you know, especially when I feel like
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.380]   I'm at the height of my abilities with certain things and I'm doing forms, but I really love
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:51.220]   academia and professors and being on campuses and that life and my whole life.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.140]   I've lived my entire adult life in academic institutions and it's really cool and rare
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.240]   and most people don't get to do it.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.420]   And I would hate to give that up.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.180]   Cause I bet once you left it, you would be like, oh, I miss it.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.180]   I want to go back.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.180]   It's the problem.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.900]   And I like, I like writing books.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900]   Like why would I want to start that?
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   Like, that's really fun.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.920]   I've been doing that since I'm, you know, 20 years old.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.460]   Like why would I want to stop doing that?
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.860]   And this podcasting thing we're having, this is cool as well.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.960]   It's the modern, this is like the, what the equivalent of having a radio show that was
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.780]   pretty successful 25 years ago.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.980]   And like, this is really interesting.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.180]   I just like too many of these things.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.700]   I love all the people at the New Yorker.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.140]   It's like really cool to write for them.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.140]   Right.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.620]   So the problem is I can do, I like all these things and like often it works and then sometimes
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.620]   it doesn't.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.820]   I mean, Jesse knows every September I say, that's it, I'm quitting.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.940]   I'm just going to live in the woods and be a writer.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.060]   But then every June I'm like, ah, these jobs are awesome.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.220]   I love all this stuff.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.120]   Why would I ever want to not do any of these things?
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   So yeah, back to retirement.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.160]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.420]   So I'm just squirreling away money.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:56.260]   I see like money is options, optionality, I don't know if that's a word, optionality.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.080]   You'll get some emails about it.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.660]   It's a real insidious process, real insidious process we have here.
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:07.620]   All right, next question, we have a little bit of an interactive here, but the overall
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:15.680]   question is, do you think Elon Musk's purchase of X had this intended effect and are that
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.220]   many people really on X?
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.540]   And I have a article here from the Washington Post that's like an interactive that you can
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.540]   scroll through.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   All right.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.700]   So we can put, this is up on the screen for people who are watching, up on the screen,
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.700]   full screen.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.860]   Our YouTube guy is yelling right now.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.940]   He's convinced that like any moment I'm not on the screen, people are going to immediately
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:34.940]   turn away.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:35.940]   All right.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.940]   All right.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.700]   I'll read this out loud for those who are listening instead of just writing.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.620]   I guess Elon on November 6th, he tweeted, they have the tweet up here, it's morning
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.620]   in America again.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.620]   All right.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.620]   Then here's the text.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.940]   At 1039 AM on the day Donald Trump declared victory for a second term, Elon Musk wrote
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.460]   six words on X.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.220]   This post instantly caught fire.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.140]   About an hour and a half, it had been seen more than 10 million times and was still reaching
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.380]   120,000 new viewers every minute.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.740]   Oh, there's a cool graph.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.740]   Oh, interesting.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.980]   This is the graph we've used over time.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.540]   It's trending down.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.300]   With over 200 million followers, can you see this?
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.620]   The arrow on the graph is like sparking.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.620]   Cool graphics.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.780]   With over 200 million followers, Musk has the biggest account on X and increasingly
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.620]   uses it to wield political power.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.540]   Look at this thing.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:30.540]   Within 26 days around the election, Musk fired off 3,870 posts that received more than 33
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.540]   billion views.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:36.340]   My God, if I was a shareholder in one of these companies, I'd be like, what are you doing?
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.340]   Come on.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:44.360]   Like this is a give those 3,000 worst, almost 4,000 posts could have been like you thinking
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.260]   about our company.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.540]   Musk reach transcends Trump's with each of his X posts typically seen by twice as many
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:56.180]   users as opposed to the president elect the other post returned to Twitter.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.540]   Trump's influence is smaller on there.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.880]   As most prepares for a central role in the U.S. government, the billionaire has a political
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.860]   megaphone unmatched in modern society.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.860]   All right.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.420]   So what do you wonder about it, Jesse?
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.880]   You're wondering like, is this true?
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.060]   How many people are really on?
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.140]   I don't think that many people are really on X.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:21.180]   I think the assumption is largely correct, right?
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:30.020]   X slash Twitter, whatever you, you know, Twitter now X really is a playpen of elites in a very
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.020]   broad sense.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:36.460]   But it was a place that this is where like intellectual, academic, technocratic and political
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.260]   elites gathered.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.020]   And this is why there was a lot of energy in this place is where they gathered.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:51.820]   They hashed out ideas, they sought status and they sort of collaboratively warred with
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.720]   each other to try to establish cultural Overton windows.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:02.520]   So it was a, a, an important place for various elites.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.000]   Most people in the country could care less.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.040]   It's not a heavily used platform.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.480]   It doesn't have a large number of active users.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.320]   It doesn't play a large role in most people's day to day life.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:17.400]   It's the smallest of the platforms in terms of, you know, it's dwarfed by something like
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.940]   Facebook.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.120]   That's why it was like valued so little, right?
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:28.000]   That's why, that's why it was like a $40 billion company where Meta is, you know, honing in
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.640]   on a trillion billion dollar valuation.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.500]   It's whatever it is, $800 million, $800 billion valuation.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.360]   It's pretty small company.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:39.200]   But the people who write about it are part of that category of cultural elites to which
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.600]   it made a really big deal.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.040]   So if you're covering technology, it's a really big deal.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.440]   It's like, this was the clubhouse where we all were.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:54.760]   And there was a, there was a change in fortune as the ownership of that clubhouse changed.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   The clubhouse became different.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.280]   It was like a bigger kid took over the tree house and put up a, like a no girls allowed
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.200]   sign like you would have had, you know, back when you were in fourth grade.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.960]   But it was like the, the cultural political equivalent of that, that the composition changed.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:13.480]   So there was, there was a period in the lead up, so in the last Donald Trump presidency
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.360]   and through the Biden presidency, there was up through, you know, Elon taking over Twitter.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.800]   There was a period where certain groups sort of had control within these elites, certain
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.720]   subset of the elite sort of had control of this platform.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.160]   And then it switched to like the other team got control of it.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.800]   And this is very traumatic if you're someone who was hanging out in this clubhouse.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.980]   But for the rest of the country, I don't think it mattered much.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:40.720]   But it did like, it set the agenda for what elites wrote about, what other elites talked
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   about.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.320]   Elite politicians would look at what was happening on here and this would set their agenda about
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.420]   how they thought about things or how they were reacting to things.
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.080]   And so it mattered to this small group of people, but I don't think it matters to most
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   normal people.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:59.960]   I actually, and I've said this from the beginning, I think it was good for our culture writ large
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:06.680]   that Elon Musk bought and semi broke this platform because it reduces its influence
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.400]   on those cultural elites.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.520]   Great, fracture it, make it more partisan.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.200]   So it's less influential.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.280]   If it's more nakedly like this team has it, this team doesn't like it.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.340]   Its impact on how a politician thinks about what matters, doesn't matter, goes down.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:24.760]   Its impact on how a journalist thinks about what am I going to write about or not write
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.280]   about goes down.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.400]   Its impact on an academic trying to think about what they want to say or not say or
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.360]   pursue goes down.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.440]   And that's for the good because it's entirely non-representative.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.960]   It doesn't represent any sort of coherent understanding of the world.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.920]   It's status seeking elites from different sides all fighting with each other.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:48.680]   So I think the more Twitter X broke, the better for our culture writ large.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.620]   I think Twitter capture of cultural elite conversations was a real problem.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:57.720]   It's not a major platform, but it was punching way above its weight class.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.800]   So yes, I think for the people who used to be really powerful on that platform who are
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.880]   no longer are really worried that someone they doesn't like is powerful on that platform.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.280]   But I think the bigger picture is most people don't care who has a lot of users on that
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.020]   platform or not.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:16.040]   Most people have real jobs and kids to take care of and aren't going to look at memes
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:21.320]   that Elon Musk is posting that he had his grok AI produce.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:28.240]   I'm working on an article right now, Jesse, that's requiring me to go deep on a few social
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.800]   platforms I'd never use and actually use them for a little bit.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.560]   That's brain rot stuff.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.000]   It's brain rot stuff.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.360]   So I think this article is histrionic.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.960]   I think, yes, to that reporter, it seemed if this is your whole world, it's like, yeah,
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.960]   it's a big deal.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.380]   The other guy took over.
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:49.560]   But I'm like, great, break it, rip the rope ladder off the metaphorical clubhouse so people
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.240]   stop paying so much attention to it because I don't think it's good.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.880]   I don't think it's good for our culture.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.960]   I don't think it's good for our politics, not good for media, it's not good for anything.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:02.160]   The elites stop hanging out among each other and creating these sort of interior super
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.560]   bubble meme filled worlds and giving it so much significance.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:12.760]   Because I guess if you do a little bit of math, 33 billion with 3,870 posts would be
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:20.440]   about 8.5 million views per post, which I guess if you compare it to 335 million people
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.080]   in the U.S., it's only like it's less than 3%.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   And it's the same people.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   Yeah, it's the same people.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   That's the problem with these.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   It's the same.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.200]   Yes, his influence graph looks big because he sort of set it up so that everyone who
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.640]   has a Twitter timeline just sees his latest thing.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:45.600]   Yeah, I've written about this for New Yorker a bunch of times, and I've written this article
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   several times.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.880]   Like, look at my article, "We Don't Need a New Twitter," for example.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.200]   I've written a couple more about this.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.440]   It's an idea that doesn't make sense.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   Our culture doesn't need it.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:59.160]   It's not as important as the people who think it's important think it is.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.880]   The problem is it didn't fall apart.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.480]   So early on, there was this accusation of like, look, when Musk took this over and started
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.240]   firing all these people, the platform itself technically was going to fall apart.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.720]   And I'd be like, that would be great, from my perspective as a cultural critic, because
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.640]   this is not a useful contribution to our culture.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.440]   The problem is Elon Musk is good at running tech companies.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:25.880]   He fired a ton of people, brought in some 10xers, drastically cut down the expenses
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   of running it.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.880]   And you know what?
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.460]   It's like perfectly stable again.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:30.460]   And he's building.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.460]   So that's the problem.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.660]   He's too good at running companies to accidentally break it.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.760]   But now it's just become like a smaller playhouse.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.720]   It's just there's these two sides we're fighting on there.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:46.560]   Now it's like mainly just this side, and you know, I don't think it's culturally important.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.640]   OK, next question.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.480]   Many fans have reached out asking me for an update on your Remarkable.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.080]   Are you still regularly using it?
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.800]   If so, has anything changed since your last update?
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.880]   I am.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.580]   I am still regularly using it.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.760]   It is my primary notebook.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:08.200]   I use that and single purpose notebooks, small field notes that I use for very specific single
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.760]   purpose uses, which I've talked about before on the show.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   Single use notebooks.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.880]   I either have my single purpose notebooks I can fit in my pocket, and then I have my
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:16.880]   Remarkable.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.880]   I don't have any other full size notebooks I use.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.960]   So I've been using it regularly.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   I still enjoy it.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.880]   I cracked the screen a little bit, but it's in the corner.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   So I think it's OK.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.520]   I was actually, the doctor's appointment today, I had a surgery and I was seeing the surgeon
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.720]   for the post-op, whatever.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:39.400]   And you know, when you see a surgeon, you get six minutes max.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.520]   Three of those six minutes was him just wanting to know about my Remarkable.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   Because you had it in your hand?
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.520]   I had it out.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   That's the magic of it.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   I can just grab it and like, yeah.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.720]   In fact, so Remarkable users know you can create as many notebooks as you want within
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   it.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.320]   And I was even seeing, actually I didn't bring it with me here.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.960]   You can have as many notebooks as you want within it, but there's also something called
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.640]   Quick Sheets, which is just like a generic notebook where you can just jot down notes.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:07.720]   So like for something like a surgeon's appointment, I just opened up a Quick Sheet and Dr. Blah
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.560]   Blah Blah, this date, took notes on what he said, because like I need to capture this
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.320]   information just temporarily so I don't forget it, but I don't need like a whole notebook
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.440]   for this surgery.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.720]   Like this is, I got some information before the surgery, I got some information here and
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.500]   let me just jot it down so I don't forget it.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.920]   But for other things, I, you know, I have full, I have full notebooks.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:28.320]   And there's probably now 30 notebooks on there.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.320]   And so yeah, I use it for everything.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:36.120]   I use it for, certainly all of my, all of my sort of work I've been doing on my new
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.360]   quarterly plan, which we're going to talk about in the final segment.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:42.000]   I've been working a lot of that out within the Remarkable.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.480]   I teach, I run a robotics club at my kid's school and that's where I keep track of.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.160]   I have a notebook for that, where this is just like in the weeds.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.600]   Who was using what computer?
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   What were the teams?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:58.240]   Who like, here's the bracket for the competition, the robot competition.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.320]   So just, you know, I'm just using it straight up for that.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.040]   When I'm working on a particular article, I might have a article notebook where I'm,
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.320]   you know, taking notes on that.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.800]   So I love my Remarkable.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.080]   I continue to think it's a great application.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.400]   They've made a couple updates to the software I like.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.240]   I think notably now, you know, you have to select what type of pen or pencil you're using.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.480]   Like, you have a stylus, but you select like how thick you want the line to be and whether
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.600]   you want it to be a pencil line or a pen line or a highlighter.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.640]   They added a second pencil or like selector next to it, so you could have two different
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.200]   things selected that you use commonly and just sort of tap on which one you want to
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   use.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   So I think that's cool.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   So I continue to be a big Remarkable fan.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.240]   Let me tell you the thing I paid for that I've never used or have barely used.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:51.360]   I got the fancy case that has a built-in keyboard, so I can open it up, turn it around, and I
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.440]   have a keyboard and it's mounted up.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   I don't use it.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.680]   I don't use the keyboard.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.760]   The typing is not well supported.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   It's not.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.480]   It's like weird where you can type and it's hard to edit, and I just don't use that.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.920]   So if you're thinking about getting a Remarkable, it's very expensive, but don't make it even
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.160]   more expensive by getting the keyboard case for now.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.520]   I've just been doing the writing.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.400]   Do you ever check the notebooks on another computer?
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.720]   Can you do that?
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720]   So it automatically syncs.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   So can you do that if you're on your laptop?
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:29.080]   So I have the app on my laptop, and whenever I'm on Wi-Fi that the Remarkable knows about,
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.360]   it'll just in the background sync things up.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:38.240]   And then if I go over to that app, it just has all the notebooks replicated in there.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.880]   So I can, if I needed to, I don't use this very often, but I just like knowing it's there.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.800]   And I actually have, where I've used it before is I've printed stuff before, or I'd be like,
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.880]   you know what, I want to print this, these notes I took.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.880]   It's easy to do.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.200]   You go to the app, you go to the notebook, you navigate over to the page and you can
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   just print them.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   So I like it.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   I think it's a cool product.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   All right.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   What do we got?
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   All right.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.680]   So this one's our corner, Slow Productivity Corner.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.280]   Oh, let's get some theme music.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:13.640]   All right, so this is your Slow Productivity Corner question.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   For people who don't know, we have one question every week.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.200]   That's relevant to my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Burnout, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   Without Burnout.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.440]   That'd be a different book, The Lost Art of Burnout.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.000]   Let me tell you how to do it.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.180]   Be a professor and a podcaster and a magazine journalist and a writer and on a couple boards
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.180]   at the same time.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.180]   And have three kids.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.180]   And have three kids.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.240]   That's how you burn out and get surgery in the middle of all that.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   All right.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.840]   What's your Slow Productivity Corner question?
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840]   All right.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.240]   What's your postmortem analysis of slow productivity?
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   Please consider the actual writing, marketing, and sales.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.800]   Are there clear things you'll do differently for your deep life book?
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.160]   Look, I think the whole project was worth it just for that theme music.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.400]   It's given us an excuse to play the Slow Productivity Corner music.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.080]   It's been an interesting ride with slow productivity.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.160]   I'm very positive about it.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.360]   But it's been an up and down ride.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:20.480]   It opened up really well because I'm relatively well known right now.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.640]   If I have a book coming out, I can do major appearances surrounding it.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.920]   I did Andrew Huberman's show on the day the book came out.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.520]   That type of stuff matters.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.760]   I have a great audience on this podcast.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.800]   I have a great audience for my newsletter.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.080]   So the book came out stronger than any book I've ever written before, which makes sense
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.080]   given my growing audience size and reputation.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.560]   Debuted as number two on the New York Times bestseller list, which was sort of good news,
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   bad news.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.320]   It could almost be better because you weren't so close to number one.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.800]   I was thwarted by James Clear having a big bulk order for Atomic Habits that week.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.880]   It made the UK bestseller list for the first time.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.720]   It made the indie bestseller list for the first time.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.040]   The book is actually doing very well in the UK, which has been interesting to see.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.700]   So I think that's all great.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.360]   It's been selling well.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.000]   It's been at probably a faster selling trajectory than any past books.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.760]   I keep convincing myself like, "Well, that's about to stop, and now it's going to fall
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:23.240]   off and fall well below other books," but I think it's doing well.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:31.600]   It got into six-figure sales as quick as any book that I have done before, which is great,
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.400]   which means now of my eight books, there's only two of my eight books that have not made
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.760]   it comfortably into six-figure book sales, so that I'm proud of.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.720]   The downside was the initial reaction to the book.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:53.420]   When it first came out, there was some negative reaction from traditional elite media.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:59.000]   As I've talked about on the show, it makes sense because I had become in this weird in-between
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   position.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.160]   I do what I call smart self-help.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:07.760]   I like to write stuff that has practical advice, but I also think about things in a way that
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.600]   you might have in a more traditional cultural commentary, more sophisticated type nonfiction.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.720]   I kind of put those two things together.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.080]   I think there's a group of just sort of the standard media that my name came to their
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:25.760]   attention doing much more traditional nonfiction journalism stuff like during the pandemic.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.440]   I spent a lot of time on NPR, for example, as a sort of resident expert on remote work
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   and knowledge work, the technology of knowledge work and knowledge work in this sort of remote
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.040]   work era.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.800]   People came to know my New Yorker work, my New Yorker journalism on technology.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:47.340]   I got some book reviews early on from reviewers who would never review a book like Slow Productivity.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.340]   Never have before in their life.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.920]   I've never read a book that has advice in it.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.080]   The New York Times, it was their main literary nonfiction book reviewers.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.160]   I'll review this, and they were like, "What the hell is this?
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.240]   This guy is giving advice?"
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.720]   Pearls being clutched, people swooning on fainting chairs.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.640]   They had just never seen a book like this before.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.240]   They don't review these types of books.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.880]   If a book like this typically was going to get reviewed at something like the Times,
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.600]   typically you would shop it out to someone from that field.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   You would say, "Great.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.040]   We'll have a freelancer, like someone who writes about business, review it."
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.200]   It's like when Adam Grant gets a book reviewed in the New York Times Book Review, they'll
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.600]   have a psychologist review it.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.840]   But no, it was like the literary book reviewer who was like, "What the hell is this?
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.840]   There's advice in here."
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.480]   That threw me off my game early on.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.920]   I was like, "What if I wrote a bad book?"
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.360]   I was getting good reviews too.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.960]   Big publications that were more used to the world of business and business advice, like
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.880]   the Financial Times, for example, in the UK, the Wall Street Journal here in the US, were
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   like, "Yeah.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   This is a good book.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   Da-da-da.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880]   Here's the points."
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   But I was thrown by the New York Times and the Times of London putting their literary
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.320]   book reviewers on it and being like, "This is crazy that someone's giving advice.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.000]   I couldn't imagine doing that in a book."
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   It was thrown.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.040]   It's this, "What if the book was—what if the writing is just—what if it's bad?
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.580]   What if it's off?"
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:08.440]   So I sort of stopped following coverage of it, stopped following sales.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.920]   Then the end of the year came, and it was all—everything switched, because at the
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.520]   end of the year, it's when book awards are given out.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.000]   It's when best books of the year lists are given out.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.800]   The book did better on those than anything I've ever written before.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.520]   People are talking about it and passing it along, and this best book of the year, best
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.840]   book of the year here and there, and business book awards, multiple different selections
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.040]   and awards.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040]   I was like, "Oh, okay.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040]   Maybe it was a good book.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.040]   Okay."
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.840]   So I waited until the end of the year to get that.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.640]   So it's this interesting up and down.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   It's doing well.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:46.800]   I think it is having a cultural impact, which is what I wanted it to have, and I'm continuing
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.640]   to draw from it on this podcast because there are so many good ideas in it.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.520]   The new book I'm working on, The Deep Life, it's similar.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:01.240]   I see The Deep Life as sort of a one—it's not a one-off book, but it's a step out of
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:07.000]   the main trajectory of my books, which is all technology and its impact in one way or
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   the other.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.560]   Slow productivity is about knowledge work broke because of computers and networks and
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.880]   email.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.600]   How do we fix it?
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   It's within that trajectory.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.960]   The Deep Life is about how do you—it's a pandemic idea.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.560]   How do you engineer your life?
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:26.280]   The whole premise of that book is we spend so much time talking about what should be
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   in a life well-lived.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.320]   We don't talk nearly enough about the mechanics of how one actually changes their life.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.400]   We don't give that nearly enough attention, the mechanics of figuring out what to do,
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.680]   making the changes, making the changes stick.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.240]   That's what we ignore, and instead we focus on what your life should have.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   It should have passion.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240]   It should have friendship.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   It should have whatever, but not how do you actually change your life.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.240]   That's pretty hard.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.900]   How does that happen in our current world of high-technology work with the opportunities
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.040]   that gives us?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.080]   This book is a little bit of a step out of the main trajectory, and I'm just leaning
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   into that.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.360]   I'm writing a practical guide.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:04.760]   The chapters have numbered sections, and it's really—I'm writing this book for my gut.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   It's just unapologetic.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.760]   Here's the ideas.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   Do this.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   This is why I think it's important.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760]   That's important.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.760]   Here's a story.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.960]   Here's a finding.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.920]   It really is really unfiltered, purified, like the way I talk on this podcast, I guess.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920]   I don't know.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.760]   I feel good about it, but it's its own thing.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.340]   It's not carefully crafted, like we have to have this very special—a lot of these books
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.340]   are really well-crafted.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:32.640]   Everything has to start with a story, and then the story has to have ideas extracted
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.680]   from it.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.680]   It's more free-flowing.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.800]   It's sections, and some sections are smaller than others.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.760]   It's as dense as anything I've ever written.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.240]   I only want super-solid ideas that I think are interesting.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.480]   I'm cutting out everything else.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.800]   It covers a huge wider range.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.800]   I don't know.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.200]   I'm really enjoying writing it, and I'm sort of just saying, "I don't know what you're
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.920]   going to categorize this book as."
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.020]   I don't know what I would compare it to.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.600]   I find it awesome.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.200]   I'm just really enjoying it, and it'll do what it's going to do, but I'm going to be
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.720]   happy that it exists out there in the world, so I'm having fun with it.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.320]   That's a lot of things to say, Jesse, but I have a lot I've been thinking about with
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.720]   slow productivity, but generally, I'm happy.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.760]   I think this book is out there.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.760]   It's selling.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   It's helping.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.240]   I think it was good.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.740]   I wasn't sure.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.720]   Some feedback that it's good, so I think all that's positive.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.380]   Are there principles for the deep life?
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:32.680]   The deep life right now is broken into two parts, each part around a big idea connected
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.880]   to our general theme here, which is the mechanics of how you actually transform your life to
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.720]   be more intentional.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.640]   Part one right now is tentatively called preparation.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:47.000]   The big idea there is that we think too much about—we want to jump right into making
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.680]   big changes in our life, but if you don't have your act together—we talked about this
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.480]   on the show, but if you don't have your act together first, you're unlikely to succeed
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.120]   in trying to make big changes.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.200]   The whole first part of the book, preparation, is how do you get your act together to the
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.840]   point where making really cool, intentional changes to your life is going to be likely
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   to succeed.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.640]   This is where I talk about discipline.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.280]   It's where I talk about being organized.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.680]   It's where I talk about reclaiming your mind, so it's like in the weeds.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.440]   Part two, transformation, is about the mechanics of how you actually reliably figure out the
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.000]   changes you want to make and successfully execute them.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.480]   They're the big ideas, lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.360]   Most people, when they think about trying to overhaul their life, they fixate on a singular
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.480]   goal that they hope will change everything.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.680]   If I can just succeed with this big, bold, singular goal I like to talk about and tell
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.480]   friends about, everything in my life will be better.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.100]   That rarely works for a lot of reasons.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.500]   It's much better to establish a rich vision of an ideal lifestyle and then work backwards
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.600]   from that to figure out, with your current opportunities and obstacles, how do I move
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   towards it.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.940]   It becomes much more strategic and tactical and in the weeds, and you're much more likely
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:50.940]   to succeed.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:58.400]   It really gets into those ideas and step-by-step, how you actually do those things.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   Preparation and transformation.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:06.920]   Even if you just read part one, it's just my guide to being an eminently capable human.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.680]   You're going to build up your capacity for discipline.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.040]   You are going to get yourself organized.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.720]   My latest thinking on what matters and doesn't matter in personal productivity, this is the
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.520]   only book you're going to find that all in.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.520]   Reclaiming your brain.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.080]   How to teach yourself to think again.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   Not just not being a slave to devices, like I talk about it, but how to actually actively
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.120]   build up contemplative abilities.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.840]   The ability to sit there with a book, to self-reflect.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.840]   You come out of part one just like you're in control of your life.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.360]   Anything's possible.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.440]   Part two is like, let's take that out for a spin and now start figuring out how to transform
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.000]   your life into something really cool.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   I'm enjoying writing this.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.120]   I'm taking my time.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:53.520]   When you take your time as a writer in nonfiction, what you get is density.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.600]   I really thought about this chapter, and I really thought about this section in this
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.200]   chapter, and I thought about it for a while, and I wrote it, and I rewrote it, and what's
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.860]   there is exactly what I want to say and nothing else.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:09.200]   You get this real density of arguments, and justifications, and stories, and evidence,
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   because if you just take the book one section at a time, and I just want to make this section
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.400]   like a New Yorker piece as good as possible.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.600]   In the end, the book is very dense, and you don't have that.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.220]   You want to avoid that sensation you get when books are written quicker of they're kind
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.220]   of stretching.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.160]   I just want to try to finish this chapter to get my word count up for the month.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.800]   This book is very dense.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.520]   The people I'm talking to, the things I'm reading, and I have no consistency to stories.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.520]   It's not slow productivity.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.640]   I had a particular thing I wanted to do, which was stories of traditional knowledge workers
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.240]   as the anchors.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.440]   Here there's like stories, but some things are not stories.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.040]   It's intellectual stories.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.720]   It's an event that happened in the world of ideas.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.800]   It's something that happened in the – there's no set story format.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.300]   It's just like what gets me to what I want to say here?
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.520]   What makes this interesting and clear?
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.680]   So some of it is like I'm talking to really interesting people, but I'm also coming up
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.800]   with like here's like a really interesting history of how this thing changed.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.280]   The reception of this book teaches us like an important lesson about this.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.520]   Here's this thing from – I'm all over the place with this, and I think it's – I don't
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520]   know.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.960]   I'm liking it.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.880]   The key question is what I'm going to do next, Jesse.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.640]   That's the question that's up in the air.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.600]   I'm wondering what the book cover is going to be for Deep Life too.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.960]   I like the full bleed image concept that came up with Slow Productivity.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.140]   This was by – I'm proud of this innovation.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:37.220]   I told my publisher, I said, "I just think we need to break out of the visual vocabulary
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:41.400]   that these idea books and business books are all in," which was vocabulary invented by
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   Gladwell.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.700]   White cover, a single image, big text.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.920]   We got to break out of that.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.920]   I think that limits your audience.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:57.520]   I want my cover to induce in the reader a physiological state that is congruent with
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.680]   the goal of the book.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:05.880]   Full bleed, aspirational, relaxing imagery, that I think was useful for the book and opened
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.840]   it up to audiences that would not pick up that book if it was a turtle at the computer
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:16.960]   screen in the middle or a single matte stick with a weird color flame and big teleport
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.960]   or whatever.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.600]   So I'm sure I'm going to probably pitch something like that for this book too, The
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   Deep Life.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.600]   All right.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.600]   That was our corner.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:33.200]   Oh, let's get our final segment where I am going to talk about where I am with my quarterly
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.640]   planning for the upcoming new year.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.760]   But first, hear from another one of our sponsors.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.680]   I want to tell you about this game-changing product that you should know about.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.160]   It's called pre-alcohol.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.840]   It's the holidays coming up, right?
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.400]   So we're recording this the week before Christmas.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.400]   There'll be a couple celebratory drinks during the holidays.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.040]   I mean, that's what you do.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.660]   I'm not as young as I used to be.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.400]   So you tip back a few drinks.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   You might have a rougher morning the next day.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.960]   You don't bounce back just as quick.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.520]   This is where pre-alcohol enters the picture.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.640]   Let me tell you about how this works.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.920]   Z-Biotics is a pre-alcohol probiotic drink that is the world's first genetically engineered
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.920]   probiotic.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.160]   It was invented by scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:27.200]   So when you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic by-product in your gut.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:33.480]   It is largely this by-product that leads to the rough next morning.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.200]   Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme that breaks this by-product down.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.040]   The way this works is you make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night, and you drink
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.600]   responsibly, and you'll feel your best tomorrow.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.720]   So as, you know, again, as I get older, this type of thing matters.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.440]   So now it's, hey, we got, I mean, I'm a fan around the holidays.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:04.120]   I like the holiday beers, the spiced heavy, like Belgian strong style beers.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.200]   You only get them one time a year.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.440]   I associate that with the holidays.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.480]   You know, it's dark out.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.540]   The Christmas lights are on.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:14.320]   Now I'm at an age where like, let me throw back a Z-biotic first before I enjoy a nice
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:21.240]   frosty pint of that, just to ensure that I remain a little bit peppy in the next morning.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.280]   So it's a cool idea for anyone.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:31.080]   So anyways, with the holiday season upon us, as we all are going to have a few celebratory
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.160]   drinks now and then, pre-alcohol is what's going to help you stay on track, not let the
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.320]   season throw you off course.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.640]   I know I will bring my Z-biotic with me this season.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.800]   So go to zbiotics.com/deep to learn more and get 15% off your first order.

[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.320]   off.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.360]   I know that some holiday companies have given those to their holiday parties.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   Oh, that's a smart idea.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.360]   Before the parties.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.080]   Maybe that's what we should have done for our holiday episode, is just both had like
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.920]   a really strong Christmas beer.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:19.760]   And as the episode went on, it gets more fun.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.440]   We're just ranting about Brandon Sanderson by the end of it.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.440]   All right.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:29.040]   I also want to talk to you, speaking of fun liquids, I want to talk to you about our longtime
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   friends at Element.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.040]   L-M-N-T.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.740]   Element is a zero sugar electrolyte drink and sparkling electrolyte water born from
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:40.580]   the growing body of research revealing that optimal health outcomes occur at sodium levels
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.020]   that are two to three times government recommendation.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.680]   So there's two ways to get Element.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.200]   The way I do it is I have the mix packets, the drink mix packets.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:55.460]   You just put it into your water bottle, you shake it up and you have the extra electrolytes
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.460]   in your water.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:02.060]   They also now sell a premixed sparkling water you can have in your fridge and grab it cold.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:06.920]   The reason why I use Element for getting my sort of extra electrolytes in water is they
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.600]   don't have junk in it.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.940]   No sugar, no artificial colors, free of other dodgy ingredients that you might find in these
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:16.940]   other mixes.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:17.940]   That's why I like them.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:22.240]   I have a big bin of these in my kitchen, right where the water bottles and my protein is.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.840]   I use it if I've had a hard workout to help hydrate.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.200]   I use it in the morning if maybe I wasn't hydrating enough the night before.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.320]   When do I figure that out?
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.280]   When I wake up cotton mouth the next morning, I'll use it then.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.960]   I'll use it if I have a long day of talking, lecturing, podcasting, doing interviews, that's
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960]   very dehydrating.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.160]   You're constantly expelling moisture.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.760]   As you talk, I will go and throw some Element electrolyte mix into my water bottle.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.800]   I use it all the time.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.980]   So I can really endorse that from personal experience.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.440]   One thing to keep in mind is they now have this chocolate medley that includes flavors
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.080]   like chocolate mint, chocolate chai, and chocolate raspberry, which are meant to be enjoyed hot.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:07.040]   You're out there in the cold shoveling snow and you want to both rehydrate and warm up.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.640]   Mix this in with hot water and it tastes great.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.600]   So it's a good winter thing to keep in mind.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.220]   You can try Element totally risk-free and if you don't like it, just give it away to
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.960]   a salty friend and they will give you your money back.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.480]   No questions asked.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.520]   Now, here's the good news.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.400]   Members of my community can receive a free Element sample pack with any order they make
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:34.960]   if they go to drinkelement.com/deep, that's drinkelementlment.com/deep, and they will
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.920]   send you a free sample pack with whatever you order.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.000]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to our final segment.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.960]   All right, so if I have this right, and tell me if I have this right, Jesse, you want me
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:52.000]   to talk about how I've updated my quarterly plan format and what is on my quarterly plan
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.040]   for the quarter that's going to begin here in the new year.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.600]   Yeah, you mentioned in last week's episode about how you were making some changes to
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.600]   it.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.960]   I had some inquiries about the specifics.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:08.000]   Okay, so, well, I have, and a lot of this reflection has come out of writing my book,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.160]   The Deep Life, because I'm thinking about generalizing advice around this type of thing
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.480]   and when I was thinking about it, I was realizing some changes that might be beneficial.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:25.360]   So as you know, I like to keep the big picture plan, the anchor plan of my multiscale planning,
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.840]   I update it roughly once a semester.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.640]   So business people call these quarterly plans because they think about quarters.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640]   I'm a professor.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.080]   I think about them as semester plans.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.800]   So my sort of winter/spring plan is what I'm working on now, and this will kind of kick
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.920]   in in the new year.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:46.540]   I used to have two of these for each semester, one for my personal life, one for my professional
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.540]   life.
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:51.300]   The change I mentioned in the last episode is I've consolidated them.
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:55.680]   It makes more sense to have just one plan because, I don't know, these are all mixed
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.040]   together to me, my life and my work, and these things mixed together in such a way that I
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.520]   wanted to deal with the whole thing holistically.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.120]   What had held me back from doing that before is that in my professional quarterly plan,
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:13.880]   I would sometimes get pretty detailed notes, especially if it's working through with writing
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   or the podcast.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.080]   It might be pretty detailed notes about, we're going to work on this sequence of articles
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.040]   and interleave with these articles, research for this book chapter here.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.760]   And actually, these bigger picture notes for the next months could get pretty complicated,
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.680]   and so that's why I had my professional plan in a separate document.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.560]   I realized I could just put those specific notes in a separate document and link to it
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.580]   from the main one.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:45.240]   So when I talk about craft in my singular semester plan, I can just link to a separate
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.620]   document that says, OK, for this thing I'm working on really heavily this semester, over
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.120]   here I'm getting to the weeds about how I want to sequence that.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.240]   So once I figured that out, I was like, great, I can have one document that I actually review.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:03.360]   I've been experimenting with the structure of this document as well, and what I've been
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.220]   working with for the plan that's about to go live is, and this comes from my thinking
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:12.280]   from the new book, is a foundation pillar approach.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.840]   So you have a foundation on which you have a few pillars.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.960]   These are what we would have used to call buckets.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.960]   The pillars are capturing important parts of your life, what you're trying to achieve
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:31.160]   there in the long term and in the current planning semester or quarter, and the foundation
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.300]   supports them all.
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.700]   So right now in the plan I'm working on, I've simplified this thumb, because this has gotten
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.700]   out of control for me before.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.440]   I've simplified this thumb.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:43.380]   The foundation typically is something that's going to be some mix of spiritual, philosophical,
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.980]   and ethical.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.780]   It's the foundation.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:50.820]   It's working on your base, your code, and base operating system, if you want to use
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:56.260]   sort of nerdy terminology, that helps you figure out how you just go about your life
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.180]   day to day, like your code, how you actually operate.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.860]   That's what you use to navigate hard things that are going to happen in your plan for
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:08.540]   doing that, and it influences the pillars you build on top of it, like what those pillars
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.220]   focus on and what you're trying to do.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.940]   So I've increasingly come to believe you need this sort of philosophical, spiritual, ethical
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:20.940]   foundation that's like your OS for life, for navigating life, and you need to keep working
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:25.280]   on that and evolving that, and that has to be clearly specified.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.860]   On top of that then come the pillars.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:30.900]   Right now, there's four pillars in particular that I'm focusing on.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:36.820]   One that is what are called constitution in our classic bucket language, but this is your
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.140]   health, health and fitness.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.880]   I've mentioned often on the show I've had to have a surgery recently.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.980]   This has sort of really knocked me off my physical game.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:50.060]   Recovery has been what it's been, but as part of this, you get lots of tests and blood tests,
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:55.980]   and it's sort of kicking off for me like my middle age renewed focus in health and fitness
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:57.380]   is a common thing you go through.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:02.340]   You get to a certain age, and now health and fitness become less about wouldn't it be great
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:05.740]   to be good at this sport and more about I don't want to bypass.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.420]   So this is a major focus going forward.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:13.540]   There's then a leadership pillar, being a leader in my family, being a leader among
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.700]   sort of like friend circles, and being a leader in the community in which I'm a part of.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:21.060]   This has become a bigger focus for me as I get older as well.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:25.500]   How to be a good father, how to be a good friend, how to be a leader within, I'm more
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.900]   leadership positions in my life now in various communities I'm involved in.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:33.300]   So that is a pillar I'm focusing on.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.780]   I guess I'll call celebration, they used the old bucket terminology, but basically a pillar
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:45.340]   focused on loving life, so like stuff that you do just because life is cool and it helps
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.180]   you acknowledge that.
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:53.020]   It's like the maker projects I do, the adventures I go on, my movie hobby of like really getting
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:56.220]   into movies and like making that a priority.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:01.260]   That's like an important pillar for me is, you know, this is it.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:06.700]   I strive a lot, but I need to be enjoying where I am now.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.700]   So that's a pillar.
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:12.780]   And then probably the thickest pillar in terms of complexity is craft, my work, the things
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:17.380]   I build with my hands and my mind and the things I'm known for and where I'm trying
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:21.940]   to go with that craft and what's my goal long term and what am I trying to do in the semester
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:22.940]   ahead.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.180]   That's what's complicated of the pillars.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:27.860]   So I have foundation and I have those four pillars.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:35.700]   The method I'm applying for navigating these in the semester ahead is one of rotating focus.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:42.900]   So choose one of these pillars and make it like a big focus and try to transform that
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.020]   part of your life.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:47.140]   The other pillars, like know what you're working on, right?
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:50.860]   Make sure you're not neglecting them, but you're not trying to make major changes in
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.860]   them.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:54.940]   And then when you finish overhauling one of those pillars, then you can say, OK, now here's
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.940]   the next pillar.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.580]   I'm going to overhaul this part of my life.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.700]   This is not something you're necessarily doing all the time.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:05.060]   But for me, it's a sort of midlife course correction that's been building up over the
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.060]   last couple of years.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:11.340]   So like I'm starting with that constitution, physical health pillar, that's getting a huge
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:15.020]   amount of my attention and it will probably for the next six months or so.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:20.340]   I will come out of that transformation with a completely different relationship to physical
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.340]   health and routine.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:28.620]   So there's all sorts of stuff happening here in terms of doctors and fitness and trainers
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:35.100]   and the amount of time and the role like exercise and diet and a lot of changes and things are
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:36.100]   having to happen in my life.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.100]   And I'm giving it focus.
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:43.180]   I want to come out of this semester having really put a lot of focus on that and my new
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:46.740]   steady state being really different than it was before.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:51.160]   The other pillars, again, it's like know what you're working on, but don't try to get crazy
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.860]   on multiple things at once.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.540]   Then I'll choose another one of these pillars.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:58.020]   Like now I really want to overhaul this part of my life and really think about it and put
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.300]   effort and energy into it and really make those changes.
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.180]   So I'm going pillar by pillar.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.820]   This might be a year or multi-year process to really get through all of them.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.580]   But this is one way you can tame the complexity of having all these different things that
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:10.580]   matter to you.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.060]   And it's overwhelming to think about optimizing all of those at the same time.
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.580]   You're just going to collapse under too many changes at once.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:21.660]   So I've really become more of a fan of, you know, it's important you have your plan that's
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.340]   reasonable for each of those.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:26.680]   And if you're going to do a major change, only work on one pillar at a time.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.900]   So that is what I'm really kicking off now during my surgery recovery.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.680]   I'm using that, all the stuff you have to do for that anyways, the physical therapy,
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.700]   the doctor's test, like use that as the just run with that momentum.
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:43.620]   And let's overhaul the whole thing, which is my way of saying by the time we get to
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:50.500]   the summer, I'm going to be looking like scars guard in the Northman.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.060]   And it's a lot of shirtless podcasting guys.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.020]   I just want to just, I'm just going to put it out there right now.
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.780]   There'll be a lot of like shirtless podcasting as I look like scars with the holiday lights,
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:02.420]   holiday lights, and killer delts.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.420]   Which one's delts?
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.420]   The back.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:12.020]   Oh, well, isn't these what's the like, what's shoulders?
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:16.300]   Shoulders, shoulders, shoulder traps, traps, traps is kind of these.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.300]   All right.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.300]   You know, that's what scars guard did for the movie.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300]   The Northman.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.300]   That's a movie.
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.740]   More people should see, by the way, uh, of two movie recommendations, Northman came out
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.740]   during COVID.
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:32.140]   So it wasn't widely seen a fantastic director, the director I really like, um, it's a Viking
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:35.580]   saga and Alex, Alexander scars guards, the star of it.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.900]   And it's, uh, it's mythological, right?
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:42.980]   So it's not done in a completely realistic frame, but it's a realistic treatment of Viking
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:45.860]   sagas and Viking mythology.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:50.740]   But the key thing is Alexander scars guard is my age, the character, they built up his
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.740]   body.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:52.740]   So he has massive traps.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.940]   He has, he's like huge traps.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:58.300]   Like they didn't want them to look, you can't get a 42 year old to look too crazy.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.260]   They don't want them to be like super inflated with muscles because a Viking wouldn't be.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.300]   So they chose this one muscle.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.300]   He's just like, so anyways, I'm going to be doing trap style.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.140]   The other movie I finally got around the scene, by the way, and I'll recommend Fritz
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:13.340]   Leng's classic M it's 1931.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:20.660]   One of the, uh, early in the sound movie era, he like innovated the use of sound completely.
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:23.380]   It's also just brilliantly shot in other ways.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.380]   It's a great movie.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.500]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.820]   It's on HBO max, whatever it's called.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:29.820]   It's on max right now.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:37.140]   So you can find it Fritz Leng's 1931 German semi-expressionistic classic M it's hard to,
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.900]   here's why it's hard to find.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.260]   If you search for M it doesn't know what to do with that.
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:44.500]   So how do you search for it?
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.420]   I actually ended up typing in Fritz Leng into the search bar and HBO max, and then it started
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.220]   bringing up Fritz Leng movies.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.780]   And then that's how I found it.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:56.460]   Same thing when I use the Apple TV search over all of the different streaming services.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:01.540]   If you just give it the letter M it's like, no, you're clearly trying to write out a word
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:04.340]   that starts with M it's like, what are the most popular movies that start with M it'll
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.980]   never actually show it to you.
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:07.940]   So, so there you go.
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:08.940]   Um, serious.
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.940]   That's what I'm, that's what I'm up to.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:15.100]   I've simplified these four pillars, a reasonable plan for each, but one that I'm going all
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.020]   in on trying to overhaul and it's getting a lot of my attention.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.220]   So just started going, um, and the other pillars, I'm still doing stuff.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:25.500]   It's just like taking the foot off the accelerator, like have a reasonable steady state.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.660]   This thing is important to me and I'm working on it and being intentional about it.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:32.500]   But the big changes are happening in this one pillar.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:36.500]   Then I'll move to the next pillar and having that foundation all the way, um, that you
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:40.300]   can keep falling back on, even if the pillar is faltered, that is what guides you day to
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.300]   day.
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:42.780]   That's a, that's a key, a key thing to have.
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.780]   There you go.
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:48.660]   That's what's going on in my semester plan.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.820]   And uh, that's my plan for my traps, which I think is what's most important here.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.460]   All right, Jesse, I think that's it.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:56.460]   Good episode.
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:57.460]   All right.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:58.460]   Jesse, take over.
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.860]   You learned everything you were wondering about.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:00.860]   Yep.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.860]   I sure did.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:02.860]   There we go.
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:06.940]   Uh, can we do like 30 minutes on the Washington nationals off season to date?
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:12.740]   Is that because I'm getting worried, I'm getting worried about the lack of significant action.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:17.820]   I am hoping that Bellinger going to the Yankees clears Christian Walker to make his way to
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:20.740]   the Nats, but I'm worried there's not going to be a major acquisition.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:24.180]   And for this season, I don't know what that would mean for my fandom.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.980]   So this is very important.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.980]   That'll be our next episode.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.980]   Just 95 minutes on the Washington nationals.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:31.980]   All right.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:36.620]   But until then, enjoy your holidays as vacation for most people, hopefully you're hearing
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:37.620]   this episode.
