[00:00:39.280 --> 00:01:01.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.040]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.880]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.120]   Got an interview for you today with the guys behind the website choosefi.com.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.400]   Going to tell us their story and share some of their tips with us.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:35.000]   Had a chance to sit down with Jonathan and Brad, the business partners behind the website
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   choosefi.com.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.320]   The tagline of their website is "Experiments in Financial Independence."
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.920]   I caught up with them a couple weeks ago at Camp Mustache Southeast, as you may have noticed.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.320]   I'm bringing you steadily, little by little, many of the interviews from that.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.880]   This interview is a bit of a potpourri of topics.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.200]   It's fairly casual, fairly discussion-oriented.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.480]   It's a little bit of Jonathan and Brad's stories, some of what they have learned in their own
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.480]   journey towards financial independence, the mistakes that they have made, the things that
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   they have done well.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.600]   Talk a little bit about travel hacking, about various approaches to financial independence,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.200]   and I think you're really going to enjoy it.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.040]   So Jonathan and Brad, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.600]   Yeah, thanks so much for having us.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.480]   We're here at Camp Mustache Southeast and you guys have a podcast and we're here at
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.600]   this kind of mustachian roundup and figured it'd be great to get you guys on the show
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.280]   and have you share, help you with some publicizing your podcast a little bit and just share your
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.120]   story with my audience.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.360]   So I don't know what to do when I got to look at two guys here.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.680]   I don't know what your relationship is.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.160]   I don't know how you guys got together, what the whole back story is here.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.320]   So who wants to start and fill me in on the path of how you wound up in this space and
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   doing what you're doing?
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.520]   Let me go first because I'm usually all over the map and then Brad is better at dialing
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.480]   us in on what our true focus is.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.240]   Yeah, he really keeps us on point on a lot of things because my brain just goes in 20
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.800]   different places.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.560]   Brad and I met back in 2016 and we met as a result, really he's already kind of developed
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.760]   himself as a site authority in the specific art of travel hacking, which maybe he can
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.520]   talk about, but he is really an expert in that place and he's built a website, TravelMiles101,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   that I won't steal a slender and talk about necessarily, but he teaches people basically
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.400]   how to travel the world for free.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.500]   And I heard him on the Mad Scientist podcast.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.560]   When you're in the space that we're in, you tend to listen to the same blogs and podcasts
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760]   as everybody else because you're voracious, you're constantly wanting to learn, right?
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.160]   And I heard him on the Mad Scientist and I was exposed to this really cool world of travel
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.740]   hacking and I found out as part of that podcast that he lived in Richmond and the common thing
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.720]   you hear is there's nobody that I can talk to about this stuff.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.920]   You're interested, you want to explore this world of financial independence, but when
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.760]   you talk about it with your neighbors, you can only talk to them for so long before they
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.520]   stop sending you Christmas cards.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.200]   So that was the impetus for me to get in touch with, to reach out and get in touch with Brad
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.720]   and just say, "Could we just get lunch and talk about some ideas?"
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.040]   And that's really all it was, although I hadn't started anything at that point and was interested
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.360]   in maybe doing that, I really did just want to meet a like-minded someone in that space.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.240]   And so we sat down for lunch and just talked about stuff that we were both interested in.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.480]   Now he's in travel hacking, but he also has a website called Richmond Savers and was very
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.120]   much in this financial independence space as well and I just wanted to hash out some
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   of those ideas with him.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.160]   So that's really just, that was our first meeting.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.240]   So Brad, you've been doing online stuff for a long time.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   Yeah, I have.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.960]   This is, I guess I'm about five years in now.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.080]   So yeah, started richmondsavers.com at first and it was just a generic personal finance
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   blog essentially, but we wound up getting some publicity for a trip to Disney World
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.040]   that we put together for my family.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   So we wound up travel hacking that for, I think we saved $4,000.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.200]   Yeah, just using credit card rewards points.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.080]   So we're opening up, hold on, take a step back, is my wife and I are both CPAs in our
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   real lives.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.840]   So we started hearing about this travel hacking, right?
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.600]   And it sounds kind of nefarious and a little odd, but it's opening up very targeted credit
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.820]   cards to get these massive signup bonuses.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.420]   So we were able to turn that into, like I said, saved about $4,000.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.560]   We spent I think $150 total on the trip for how many people?
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.640]   It was for the four of us.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.680]   So I had two, yeah, two young daughters and actually we went, since you asked, we went
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.000]   with our, my parents and my wife's parents as well.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.360]   So it was this amazing three generation trip and we just kind of got some publicity in
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.240]   the New York Times and NBC, CBS and my tiny little Richmond Savers website all of a sudden
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   is on the map.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.720]   And I realized there are a lot of people like us who can benefit essentially from this concept
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   of travel hacking.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.640]   So yeah, so kind of fast forward a couple of years and Jonathan reaches out to me and
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.120]   I hear financial independence, Richmond and burgers, right?
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   And I'm just sold.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120]   - He'll take that lunch date.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.560]   So that was, that's a lunch I'll take a hundred times out of a hundred.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.280]   So as you'll hear on this podcast, Jonathan has a million ideas and he's a really smart
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.000]   guy, really interesting.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.120]   And I'll take a lunch like that anytime.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.160]   And we just kind of became friends over the course of months and basically this last year.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.560]   And Jonathan had this great idea for Choose FI and I'll throw it over to him to kind of
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   talk about.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   - Yeah, no.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.200]   So I did get a chance to sit down with him and just talk about financial independence.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.240]   And I think even during that lunch, I was thinking, there's one thing I'm not really
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   seeing.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.840]   I'm getting a lot of great contact, a lot of great content and a lot of information,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.440]   but it's so fragmented.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.360]   And you're always trying to find how does that information fit my life and my journey
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.120]   and where I'm at now.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.800]   And you're in a place where you almost want to design your own curriculum to take, help
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.640]   middle-class America build wealth one life hack at a time.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.680]   That's kind of a tagline, I get that.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.680]   - That's fantastic tagline.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680]   - Yes, yes, yes, right.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   - Well, we've been working on that.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.520]   - Copyright, copyright, shift that mic quickly, quickly.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   But that's what you want.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.880]   Everything is this journey and in this journey, you make choices and hopefully you're satisfied
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   with the choices that you've made up to this point.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.120]   But I really wanted to, I think there's a need out there to build something that helps
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.200]   take people from where they are to where they want to be and actually model it for them.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.520]   It's really hard to relate to a millionaire or a billionaire, someone that's completely
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.560]   got it made.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   You don't necessarily see the things that they did to actually get there.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.680]   Even though I'm sure they had to work very hard and they put a lot of time in, all you
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.820]   see is that they're actually doing it.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.680]   And whenever you go to a blog that's very developed, it's really hard to actually go
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.920]   back to the beginning and find out where they started and find out what that journey actually
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   looks like.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   And I know it's what I do.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.040]   Anytime I find a new blog, I don't go to the latest article.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.720]   It may get me to check it out further, but if I like that latest article, I immediately
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.920]   want to go to the beginning.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.920]   And nobody does it that way.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.000]   The way RSS feeds are aggregated, you always look at the latest content and the oldest
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   content is buried.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.440]   You just can't find it.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.400]   So my idea that I said is let's just take people on a journey that's step by step and
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.360]   walks through what everybody has to do.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.480]   I mean, it's a very simple plan for financial independence.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.200]   You need to slash your expenses.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.280]   You need to create margin in your life.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.080]   And then you can either, and then it's what you're going to do with that margin.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   You have options, right?
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.120]   You could just invest it passively if you have enough of it, or you could build a business.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.760]   I mean, you have a lot of flexibility.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.280]   But what does that actually look like?
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.480]   It's fine to say that.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   It's fine to make a tagline.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.920]   But what does that actually look like on a step by step basis?
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.840]   So Brad got really excited about that.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.200]   I mean, I was really excited about that.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:59.000]   I can talk nonstop about it for an hour to anybody that will listen to me.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.100]   And he said, "That sounds awesome."
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.320]   So anyways, we left that conversation and that was it.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   It was fun.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   It's fun to talk about.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.400]   I think I'm going to do something.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.720]   He contacts me two months later by text or email and says, "Hey man, did you end up starting
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   anything?"
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.200]   I'm rolling to bed to go back to my nine to five.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   Like, nothing.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.280]   Nothing had been done on it, right?
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   And isn't that the case?
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.960]   How many great conversations do you have that are just dust in the wind, right?
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.160]   So I'm rolling to bed on my nine to five and I sheepishly text him back, "Actually, you
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.680]   know I haven't done anything yet, but you know what?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   I'm going to."
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.840]   So I came up with the branding that probably within a day or a week of that, choose FI,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.160]   which is you choose financial independence.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.080]   It's a choice.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.320]   And I got the domain name and I got the blog.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.160]   And then I said, "Brad, can we sit back down and do lunch?"
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.760]   And he didn't know this was coming, but I sat back down with him and we laid it out
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.440]   and I said, "You know, I can do this on my own.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   I'm a tech guy.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.360]   You know, I have confidence in my abilities.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.440]   I can build all this stuff up, but I think it would be really cool if we just did it
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   together."
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.840]   And then that's kind of a segue into the power of partnerships because that is blossoming.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   And our website now, you know, we have a website that's essentially brand new and new websites
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.120]   really have no business being ranked for the first year or two.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.720]   There's an organic process, but Brad already has site authority in a few different areas.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.400]   We have contacts that we can bring really, we can bring thought leaders and influencers,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.800]   you know, that maybe you shouldn't be able to get as a brand new blog or a podcast, potentially.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   So we can bring these thought leaders on.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.640]   But the whole idea is instead of just doing interviews, right?
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.320]   Which there's a fair number of interviews that are done.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.560]   We want to get back in there and bring them on as it fits the story.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   As you know, we want to bring them because they figured something out.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   I don't know everything.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   Brad doesn't know everything.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   We're two regular guys, but we want to bring those thought leaders on as they fit the journey,
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   as they fit the story.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.840]   And then we want to get them help us with those steps as we're proceeding through it
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.760]   and then document it for you because you don't need to be the smartest person.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   You don't need to be a doctor.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.840]   You need to be a little bit smarter than average America and then just actually pay attention
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.600]   to stuff and make the right choices.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.120]   So the concept then is it's primarily about each of your individual stories with your
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.080]   families, but you're bringing people in to give you advice.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.400]   So you're sitting and asking questions.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.720]   Do I understand that clearly?
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.120]   Well, we're trying to crowdsource on some level, certainly.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   So you're right there.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.660]   But I think what we're trying to describe it as is experiments in financial independence.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.160]   So it's, we don't have all the answers.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   We're going to screw up.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.840]   We're going to fail miserably on some things and we're going to succeed wildly on others.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   But we're going to try to document every step of the way and then come up with like an 80/20
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.160]   analysis essentially where people can say, okay, this, this will work for me.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   This won't work for me.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.840]   You know, and they can, they can look at it and actually discern what would be valuable
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.440]   for my life essentially.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.040]   So I think that's kind of the starting point.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   No.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   And there's so many different places that can go.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.520]   You know, the one common theme, you know, Dave Ramsey has done an amazing job.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.240]   Most of us respect Dave Ramsey.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.600]   He's done an amazing job getting people out of debt and off the financial cliff.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   Right.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.720]   And I think most of us agree that he just kind of gives up at some point and says, now
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.120]   go invest and give or go build wealth and give.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   Right.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120]   Right.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   It's a pretty empty, vague picture.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   Like what does that actually look like?
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   Right.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.560]   Um, so you know, we're not getting the people off the financial cliff in every case, although
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.720]   we think we have good content for that, but we're kind of focusing on that space where
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.560]   you now realize there's a problem and you know how to balance a checkbook and do our
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.520]   things, but you want to do it a little bit smarter and you want someone to model it for
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.680]   you and show you, you know, kind of a progressive series of steps, what is actually available.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.480]   And I think one of the interesting things is, you know, different perspectives, right?
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.960]   So you know, I'm farther along the financial independence path, you know, probably maybe
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.440]   two to three years out at this point.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.740]   And Jonathan has a fantastic story.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.280]   So he killed, he paid off, excuse me, 168,000.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.560]   Jonathan killed the guy.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   It was a bad guy.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   It was a dark day in my life.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   Jonathan killed.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.080]   Jonathan is now financially independent.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.280]   After eight years of jail time, good behavior.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.800]   So he is a pharmacist.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.880]   He came out of pharmacy school three and a half years ago with $168,000 in debt.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.080]   He's set to pay it off in about two months.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   168k.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.080]   Congratulations.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.520]   I'm going to do that I'm debt free scream.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.520]   Exactly.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   That's right.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   That's right.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.880]   So I mean, this is the perfect experiment in financial independence, right?
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.480]   I mean, he is literally at net worth zero, or he very soon will be.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.600]   He has this amazing, amazing amount of margin, right?
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   Because he's been spending, you know, paying down 50k a year.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   And all of a sudden he has 50k or thereabouts, you know, 30 to 50k to play with.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   How cool is that?
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   Right?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   I take checks, Jonathan.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   Hey, brother.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.200]   Now the funny thing about think about that, though, think of how many people are starting
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.160]   out from totally from scratch at the age of 30 or 40 or 50 or whatever else.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.960]   And you know, what does what does that look like?
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   And there's two pieces of that.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.080]   One is that America, most of America stuff stuck on the hamster wheel, whether or not
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.360]   they realize it or not, right?
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.240]   They're sacrificing their future for expensive cable and cell phone bills and just, you know,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.460]   all this nonsense.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.200]   And you don't need to do you know, everything right.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.580]   But if you can just get just a few life hacks under your belt, just make you know, make
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.680]   sure what the value proposition is what you what the trade off is.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.920]   Just get a few of these principles really under your belt, you can just retire decades
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.480]   ahead of your peers, you know, and you'll have to do everything that we're doing.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.280]   But if you listen to it, and you like the content and something appeals to you, hey,
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.420]   here's a step by step process.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.420]   This is what we did.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.960]   We're not gurus, nothing special about us, nothing that you couldn't replicate.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.280]   And we just want to walk you through it.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.080]   And you know what, we're also crowdsourcing it.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.960]   So we're setting it up so that, you know, our listeners can give us their ideas or thoughts.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.640]   And then if they package it well, and they provide something that's, you know, a great
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.920]   idea or a concept or something that should be discussed, we'll go find the thought leaders,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.640]   and we'll bring them on and then we'll do a roundtable and we'll discuss that concept.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.720]   So you know, really opening this up and getting America involved in this.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   That's great.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   That's awesome.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:08.400]   You so Jonathan, you're working as a pharmacist now you got out of pharmacy school three years
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   ago.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   Yeah, 2013.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400]   Okay.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   And married?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   Yes.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   Yeah, kid on the way.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   Okay.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   And you had two young kids.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Two young daughters.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.560]   So tell me, because oftentimes, oftentimes, our wives and children are going to influence
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.480]   and many times it seems like there's an over domination of kind of young single people
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   who are saying, hey, we're going to be financially independent.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.520]   And there's not a huge representation of people with with young children.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.000]   Maybe that's too aggressive a statement.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   But what do your wives think about this plan?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.960]   Yeah, that's, that's a great question.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.500]   I think my wife has always been on board.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.080]   So she has probably always been more frugal than I am, actually, which is just a wonderful
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   blessing.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   Yes.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   So quick poll.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.080]   Jonathan, is your wife more frugal?
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   If isn't that just the biggest blessing in the world?
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   It's incredible.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   I'm like the total.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.520]   I think there's a life hack that there's something there that people should be considering, you
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.960]   know, when you're going to go find someone to marry, and I'm not saying this needs to
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.200]   be the only qualification, but if it happens to be, if you find someone that's more frugal
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.720]   than you, there's a strong chance that you're going to end up in a good place.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.440]   And we've heard that at Cam Mustache, right?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.640]   When we went around the table, there were three instances, I think, where the wife was
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.880]   the one who, you know, dragged the husband in kicking and screaming.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.720]   And now they're here at Cam Mustache and are on the path to five.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.340]   So yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.580]   My wife doesn't want me to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.680]   She wants me to keep my wallet in my pocket.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   It's incredible, right?
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.640]   My wife doesn't want me to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.400]   She just wants me to be there beside her.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   Right, right.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   So I interrupted you.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   No, no, no.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   Your wife is always on board.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   Yeah, she's been on board.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.680]   We're from Long Island, New York, originally, and that's a very high cost of living place.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   Sure, absolutely.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.040]   So, you know, both CPAs, we had, you know, decent jobs.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.720]   But we just looked at each other pretty much maybe two months after we got married in '05
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.400]   and just said, "We cannot make the life we want to make here on Long Island.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   It's just impossible."
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.440]   So, I mean, we literally picked up and moved.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.780]   And you know, moved down to Richmond, Virginia, where I coincidentally went to college.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:16.540]   So we had some support system, but left all of our family, all of our friends, and made
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.620]   that move.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.340]   And I mean, that was the first major step on the path to FI for sure.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.340]   Awesome.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.340]   Jonathan, you?
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.940]   You know, going back to my story of kind of being this hamster wheel, like I'm the American
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.940]   success story, which is the weird thing, right?
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.940]   Like I am the guy—
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.940]   Because you probably don't feel like it.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.940]   Yeah, no, that's the thing.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.940]   After 158K and that.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.940]   Right.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.940]   No, let's talk about that.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:43.300]   So, you know, when you are a student or when you're in your teens, your parents' number
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.260]   one goal is to make sure that you get a good job, right?
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.480]   That's what we push.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.780]   We want to make sure you go to college so that you get a good job.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.500]   It's a universal concern for parents for their children.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   And you know, I did it.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.780]   I did exactly what America tells you is the best possible path, right?
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.120]   So I got into a medical profession, and then I got out and I got a job.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.460]   But along with that comes the six-figure burden of debt.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.460]   So I'm out now.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   I'm 28 years old.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.740]   But now I have the six figures of debt.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.540]   I have a six-figure income, so that's fine.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.980]   It's a great—it's a good thing, right?
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.980]   I mean, I have a six-figure income.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.180]   I can easily pay it down.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.340]   And I do, and I pay it down.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.060]   And now I'm 32.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.540]   And I'd say that my plan basically worked.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.620]   That was the best you could hope for if you're going from not having school paid for.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.140]   But now I'm 32 years old, and I'm essentially starting from scratch.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.440]   And you've got to ask yourself, was that the most efficient path to get there?
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.180]   Now, discounting the fact that a lot of people—and if you're going into medicine or pharmacy
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.780]   or any field because you're passionate about that and you care about people, and I'm not
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.000]   saying I don't, but specifically if you—
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   You hate people.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I hate people, yeah.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Just admit it.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I can't do it, man.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I can't do it.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.560]   I love people.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.760]   But if you're going into that because you just truly want to help people, then do it.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.420]   Follow your passion if that's your passion.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.440]   But let's just say you're going into a medical profession because you want to make six figures,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.400]   and that's how you make six figures.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.200]   The way I did it, I'm just going to be honest, it's an incredibly inefficient way to do it.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.440]   There are so many easier ways that you can get to financial independence or six-figure
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.100]   income even without going through essentially what I did, which was a 14-year process in
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.040]   terms of my brain and what I'm thinking and where I'm aligning my goals.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.860]   What if you spent that 14 years learning new skills, and you did it with the confidence
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.680]   that this is what the stepwise process looks like to get there, not I'm going off into
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.360]   the great beyond and who knows what's going to happen, but you just had a role model.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360]   I think it's the biggest thing.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.760]   People don't always have a role model to show them what a step-by-step process to get to
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.320]   financial independence looks like.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.040]   Yeah, and people don't believe that they can get wealthy on a middle-class income.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   They just don't.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.440]   Because like Jonathan said, they're not seeing it in their real lives.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.820]   But if they can see that—Jonathan can do it.
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.920]   Even starting out, 168K in debt, if they can see that I can do it and my wife and I can
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   do it on regular, albeit CPA incomes, but just kind of middle manager positions.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   Hold on.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.080]   I'm going to pick on you about that.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.000]   Not that you wouldn't agree with me, but I get so tired of people discounting their high
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.200]   income.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.320]   The reason is that's one of the components that's important.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   Yes, you can get wealthy on $40,000 a year.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.000]   If you save $5,000 a year and you do it for 50 years, it's possible.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.120]   But the path to wealth does involve good income.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   It certainly helps.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   The path to wealth does involve CPA.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.800]   The path to wealth can involve pharmacists.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.280]   And we've got to be careful in this space about not discounting that and not trying
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.480]   to kind of sell something that, yes, you can do it on $20,000.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.040]   Well, maybe you can do it on $20,000 a year.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.320]   We'll be optimists.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.520]   But it's a lot easier on $200,000 a year than on $20,000.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.760]   Well, you're not wrong.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.240]   I think what you're getting at is essentially what I said, and that is that there are easier
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.800]   ways to get a six-figure income than to give up 14 years of your life studying one particular
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   topic.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   Amen.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.480]   I agree.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.120]   What if you were trained or training yourself, or in some cases, training your child?
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.240]   There's this first wave.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.640]   We're like first-generation FIRE, right?
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   This concept.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.960]   Dave Ramsey introduced this in the '90s, but it was more getting out of debt and then living
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   debt-free.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.800]   So the FIRE, financial independence, early retirement, or retire early, is more of something
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   that's hitting now.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.440]   It's kind of peaking right now.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.880]   At some point, you're going to be looking at this not from the perspective of what you
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.460]   want to do for yourself, Joshua, but you're going to be looking at it on how can I steer
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.460]   my kids?
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.940]   How can I model this for them?
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.080]   How can I give them the tips that they need to succeed?
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.360]   It's still the same audience, but it's a different focus.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.280]   You're thinking, "I need to model this for my kids and show them all these different
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280]   opportunities."
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.600]   I think if you were being intellectually honest, you would say, "Sure, maybe if they want to
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.040]   be a doctor or if they want to be a pharmacist, of course, I'm going to encourage them in
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   their passions."
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.160]   But you might also be able to give them a little bit broader perspective because you
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.240]   don't have to do that to earn a high income.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.400]   If you start them early down this path, there's some really cool opportunities for them that
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.680]   just I didn't even know were available to me in my early teens.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:18.880]   I have the same, shall we say, regret, resentment, frustration, something like that, that sounds
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   like you do.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.280]   Because when I was younger, when I was graduating high school type of thing, if I had known
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.160]   then what I know now, I would do things differently.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.760]   I have known then what I know now.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.240]   That's exactly how I feel.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.280]   I look at it and I say, "College is easy to pick on."
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.200]   I went to college because I'm the kind of person who goes to college.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.960]   We have more letters after your name than anybody I know, right?
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   Right.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.480]   But that's because I'm the kind of person who does stuff.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.120]   At least the letters after my name were me improving my career and taking advantage of
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.400]   "tuition wasn't free, it was part of my compensation package."
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.520]   I figure if someone wants to give you tuition and I'm academically competent and it's not
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.360]   difficult for me to pass exams.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.000]   I went to college because I'm the kind of person who went to college.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.160]   Here's what I don't know how to do but I want to do.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.200]   How do we take the kind of person who is the kind of person who goes to college and present
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.180]   them with some of these alternative paths?
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.040]   College can be part of it, but when I think back and I think about the person who at,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:30.480]   say, 18 years old goes and spends a year or two or six months working in various professions,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.360]   six months working as a carpenter, six months working as a plumber, six months working as
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:40.560]   an electrician helper, etc. and spends their nights on YouTube or getting some books on
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.920]   trade school and then takes the money that they've earned and saves and then goes and
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.080]   invests that time in building their own house.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.480]   And they come out the other side by building a house slowly and doing themselves from a
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   young age they come out and have a debt-free house that they built themselves.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.960]   It's totally possible.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.160]   That's just not the path that's often recommended.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.800]   And we often talk about business.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.320]   One thing that we have to be careful of, of discounting professions.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.880]   Tom Stanley in one of his books, he talked about why the Millionaire Next Door, which
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.160]   was primarily composed of entrepreneur, why does that millionaire always go and recommend
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.800]   that their children become pharmacists or doctors or lawyers or some stable profession?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   Because the entrepreneur knows everything that can go wrong.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.280]   They know how risky it is and they know that, "Hey, listen, if you do this, it's a more
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.680]   guaranteed thing."
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.120]   But I look at it and say, "Okay, yes, it's risky, but what if we change it on its head?"
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.280]   Going to school for 14 years to go into a career that you may or may not love on the
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.100]   backside is also risky.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.320]   So I'm with you.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.800]   That's a long-winded way of saying amen.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   Yeah, preach it.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   No, no.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.720]   We got to keep working on figuring out how to approach these things in a more intelligent
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   way.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.120]   And I'm sure there is a game plan in there that can be written out.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.440]   It's going to be different for everybody.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   It is an individual choice.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.520]   It's what do you love, what do you not love.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.000]   It's designing a lifestyle that suits your passions.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.640]   But America is very good at telling you what you have to do.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.840]   And it's so hard at that age.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.520]   There's fear.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   Yeah, it's very hard to home in and be willing to go your own way.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.960]   Yeah, but do something differently.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.000]   Because the whole culture praises conformance, conformity.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.640]   And at that age, it's a rare young man or woman in their middle teen to late teen years
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.940]   who can stand up and say, "No, I'm going to go against it."
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.500]   Most college students, I'm convinced, most college students choose the college they go
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.380]   to because that's the one their friends are going to.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.380]   Yeah, you're not wrong.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.620]   So, Brad, let's talk travel hacking for a minute.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.820]   So I haven't, you know what, I should probably, we should do a standalone episode at some
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.580]   point in the future because I haven't really covered much with travel hacking.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:50.340]   But what is it and how do people, where do people go other than obviously your website?
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.380]   But like, how do you get started with this world?
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.780]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.820]   So travel hacking, as I kind of alluded to before, it's opening up very targeted credit
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:04.780]   cards that offer these massive signup bonuses, which you then parlay into free travel.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.740]   Now obvious caveat is this is credit card related.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.540]   So please, anyone listening to this, do not get into it if you have any issue with credit
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.540]   cards whatsoever.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.100]   If you do not pay it off on time and in full, or if you spend more than you otherwise would.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.100]   Right?
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.020]   So, you know, the please just stop listening essentially now.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.420]   Which means now, of course, that they are going to be listening.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.420]   Even, whoa, what do you not want me to hear?
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.420]   Tell me the secret.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.340]   Here's all the juicy stuff.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.940]   So you know, it's basically taking your smart financial habits and instead of getting, you
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.580]   know, what do you get, Joshua, on your, on your, you know, cashback rewards card, one,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.060]   2% if you're lucky, right?
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.700]   You know, and I have found that in with these new cards that I open, I get somewhere between
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:53.380]   15 to 30%, essentially a rebate on every dollar that we spend in life.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.380]   Okay?
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.420]   Because we're funneling all of our expenses through on our credit cards.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.260]   We're getting these signup bonuses and then just moving card to card.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   Okay?
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.940]   So we're continually opening new cards and then just racking up these bonuses.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:12.740]   I mean, at last count, I've earned 2.5 million miles and points, which I estimate is worth
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.220]   somewhere, you know, at a two cent per point valuation is worth $50,000.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   Wow.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.860]   So, and, and just to add onto that, that is a post tax.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.780]   So that's, you know, they don't pay any taxes, applications whatsoever.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.060]   So the great bending beauties of mileage.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.060]   So right.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.420]   So it's parlaying these, you know, when you stack these bonuses together, you can actually
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.180]   put real significant trips together.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.360]   I mean, just this past summer, uh, you know, I took my wife and two daughters, we went
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.680]   to the San Francisco Bay area.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.580]   We flew four round trips for free on Southwest.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.940]   We stayed in this really nice Hyatt hotel for 10 nights, completely free.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:55.540]   So I mean, I think the entire trip cost us $44 and 80 cents for the, you know, unavoidable
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.300]   taxes and fees on the award flight.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.940]   So you know, that's pretty fantastic.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.100]   Absolutely.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:07.220]   So obviously we're not prepared here to do a good kind of like intro or primer, but I
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.180]   do want to ask one question.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:15.220]   Have you calculated the time involved and what the actual payoff is in terms of the
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.700]   time that you put into this?
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.700]   Great question.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   So just like anything in life, it's what you want to put into it.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:27.580]   So I, so with my website, which we mentioned before is travel miles one Oh one.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.860]   It's similar to Jonathan and my, our project here with trees up high, which is different
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.860]   perspectives.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.860]   Right.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.860]   Okay.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.860]   So not to dive too deep into the answer here, but my business partner in that Alexi, he's
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.040]   a cardiologist.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.700]   He has a ton of spending and he also does this other wacky stuff called manufactured
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.700]   spending.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.700]   You know, he spends a lot of time.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.620]   I spend essentially zero time.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.620]   Okay.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.040]   I take the laid back, no frills approach.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.620]   We open one card, we put all of our normal spending there.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.900]   So no time whatsoever.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.220]   So maybe we're at 10 minutes to open a credit card.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   Right.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:08.180]   So 10 minutes we, you know, just have to loosely track our spending and because you have to
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.820]   hit these spending requirements.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.860]   So you know, you have to be organized somewhat.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   Okay.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.860]   Card calls for six grand.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.360]   You'd have to know when you have to hit six grand.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.880]   Once you've hit six grand, you put the card down, you open it and you open a new card
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   at that point.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.020]   So, you know, honestly it takes very minimal time to actually rack up the points.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.500]   Then you know, of course redeeming takes a little more time.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.980]   You know, you have to plan where you want to travel.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.300]   You have to see if there's availability.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.820]   It's not terribly difficult and especially if you can be flexible.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.420]   That's kind of my buzzword is flexibility.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:42.720]   You know, you can't kind of shoehorn your regular travel schedule into travel rewards.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.420]   You just can't because you know, there are limitations.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.940]   That's why it helps to be financially independent.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   That's exactly right.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   That's another word that we use.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940]   That's exactly right.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:55.980]   I just bought a ticket and I can't remember where it was to, but I just was stunned at
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.700]   how I'm always often stunned at how cheap you can get flights if you don't have to be
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.620]   somewhere on a certain day.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.460]   And that's one of the benefits of having a mobile business, a location independent, financial
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.460]   independent, et cetera.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.700]   It's like everything is built to take as much money away from people who work as possible
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.860]   and people who don't work for a living can get everything for free.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.860]   So true.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.260]   And that certainly extends to travel hacking for sure.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260]   Well, awesome guys.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.060]   So the website and the podcast is ChooseFI.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.060]   ChooseFI.com.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.900]   It's primarily a podcast or both?
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.300]   It's a companion.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.580]   We use the articles to create content for the podcast.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:36.740]   We use the podcast to drive people to the articles so that you have, you listen, you
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.780]   see what's interest you, then you know where to grab on with the articles.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.060]   And so it kind of feeds off each other.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.460]   They're really intended to be a companion podcast to the blog.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.780]   And I think they build off each other in a really synergistic way.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.780]   Awesome.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:53.620]   I'm glad to hear people taking this concept of financial media and adding twists to it
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.980]   that can be more relevant, more interesting as we can continue to expand.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.540]   So ChooseFI.com, other website, travel point website?
