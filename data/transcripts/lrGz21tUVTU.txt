[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Well, back in a 2001 Gallup poll, respondents were asked to attribute the description "emotional"
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   to one of the two sexes.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.600]   Was "emotional" truer of men or of women?
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   Of course, 90% said "emotional" was truer of women.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.100]   Surveys like this one feed an old stereotype, and it's a very old stereotype, at least as
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.600]   old as Aristotle, that says the pink brain is more emotional and the blue brain is more
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   rational.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.280]   But does such a dichotomy hold true in Scripture?
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.040]   Today's question is from an anonymous woman.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.040]   Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.000]   It seems there's a constant narrative in our culture here in the West that women are hyper-emotional,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.360]   irrational, crazy, incomprehensible, and almost intrinsically unreasonable.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.920]   Attributes such as rationality, reasonability, and emotional stability are typically attributed
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.920]   to men.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.520]   Unfortunately, I hear this same narrative from brothers in my church.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.480]   I often feel I can't speak up, because if I spoke up, I would just simply reinforce
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.960]   this narrative.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.520]   So can you help me outline the problem with this narrative?
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.720]   How should a renewed mind address this caricature?
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.920]   Is emotional woman versus rational man a biblical dichotomy?
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.980]   There are three things that I might be able to squeeze into this episode that I think
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.460]   need to be said.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.740]   Number one, this narrative is not the only one that is prominent in the West.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.140]   Frankly, unless I'm blind as a bat, I don't live in a milieu where this narrative that
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.020]   she described is prominent at all.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.800]   I mean, the ministries that I associate with, the church I go to, the fellowship of churches
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.900]   I'm involved with, the conferences I attend, don't think this way.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.900]   They are resistant to that kind of caricature and stereotyping, namely that women are hyper-emotional,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.140]   irrational, crazy, incomprehensible, while men are the models of reasonableness and emotional
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.020]   stability.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.100]   That's just not a narrative that I live with.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.180]   I mean, in my home, I'm Mr. Emotional, my wife is Ms. Rational.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.620]   That's one of our problems for 49 years.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.220]   But anyway, nor do I see this narrative as prominent in television and movies, where
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.020]   it seems to me, with my little teeny bit of exposure, perhaps in reaction to that very
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.980]   woman-demeaning narrative, the dominant narrative today in the media is that woman is equally
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.380]   irrational, equally feisty, equally brash, equally violent, equally dominant in sex,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.060]   equally strong, equally sinful in most every way that men are.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.540]   So I wouldn't want to give the impression that the narrative that I'm being asked to
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.460]   address is the only one that is prominent in our culture.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.940]   But she asked for it, she sees it, she feels it, it's reality where she is, and no doubt
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.100]   not just in the West, but perhaps even more outside the West.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.460]   So I need to say something about it, and I'm eager to, especially she asks about, "Is
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.380]   emotional woman versus rational man a biblical dichotomy?"
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.300]   So this is my second observation.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.300]   I said I had three.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.700]   This is number two.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.260]   My answer to that question is no.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.660]   That's not an emotional - I mean, that's not a biblical dichotomy.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.140]   But when I say no, I don't mean to imply that the Bible teaches women and men are in general
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.700]   emotionally identical.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.820]   But I'll get to that in my third point.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.120]   Abigail in 1 Samuel 25 is clearly more cool-headed and rational in dealing with David than her
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.660]   idiot husband Nabal, whose very name means "fool," and who pouts his way emotionally
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.620]   into the grave.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.140]   Deborah in Judges 4 has to rebuke Barak for acting foolishly in response to God's word
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.980]   about going up to battle with Sisera.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:28.020]   Jail was cool-headed enough to trick careless Sisera into being drugged with a soporific
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.900]   bowl of milk so she could drive a tent peg through his skull.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:40.740]   Jezebel had the ruthless, shrewd, cool rationality to trap the righteous Naboth in a plot to
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.180]   steal his vineyard so that her moping husband could get out of his self-pitying funk because
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.540]   he couldn't wah-wah-wah have some little property that he wanted.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.580]   And the Virgin Mary—I love this contrast between Mary and Zechariah—the Virgin Mary's
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:08.020]   question to the angel, "How can this be?" was answered, while Zechariah's skeptical
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.300]   question about, "Whoa, we're too old to have kids," was struck dumb because God
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.340]   was so upset with his unwise response.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:33.960]   So you don't find a uniform paradigm in the Bible of rational man, emotional woman.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.060]   The place where interpreters have found this, presumably, is in 1 Timothy 2:13, where Paul
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.740]   says that Eve was deceived, not Adam, in the temptation in the Garden of Eden.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.580]   And interpreters say, "Whoa, the reason for that is because she's emotional and
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.580]   he's rational."
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.580]   Now I think that explanation, which isn't in the text, that she's emotional and he's
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.700]   cool and rational and has everything worked out, is utterly simplistic and overlooks something
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:21.380]   more crucial, namely, Satan knew that God's created design was for the man to be the leader
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.660]   and the protector in this relationship with his wife, and therefore, with both of them
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.100]   present, as it makes clear in Genesis 3:6, with both of them standing there in front
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:43.860]   of him, Satan scorns the man's leadership and scorns God's design, and ignores the
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.500]   man, focuses all his attention on the woman, thus inverts and assaults God's plan with
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   the catastrophic result of the fall of humanity into sin, and they fell together.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   Adam fell in failing to step up and face this enemy, and the woman fell as the one dealing
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.620]   directly with the tempter, which is what I think Paul had in mind when he said she was
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.140]   deceived, not the man.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.020]   She was deceived directly as the spokesman.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.300]   But both of them accepted the temptation.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.100]   So the point does not seem to me to be mainly that the woman is emotionally deceivable and
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.460]   the man is rationally not, since they both yielded to the tempter.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:41.420]   Rather, the point is that destructive consequences follow when God's design for manhood and womanhood
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.100]   are undermined by the devil or by culture.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.220]   Now here's my third and last observation.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:58.540]   We need to be careful in defending the rationality of womanhood and the emotional richness of
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:07.620]   manhood that we not fall into the trap of thinking that the only way we can have equal
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:15.180]   value and equal dignity and equal personhood is by having identical sameness of emotional
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.900]   tendencies and identical sameness of rational tendencies in men and women.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:29.500]   I doubt very much that that is the case, that there are identical and same emotional and
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.260]   rational tendencies in male and female.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.700]   And I say this more as a caution than a biblical conviction.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:49.260]   My caution is that in our rush to defend equality, we assume sameness instead of equally valuable
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.420]   differences.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:09:00.460]   What if women—attest this—what if women in general have kinds of nurturing tendencies
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:10.540]   that men don't as generally have, and what if, therefore, women in general have kinds
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:19.740]   of empathy that men don't as generally have, and what if, therefore, women in general have
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:27.860]   kinds of emotional connectedness and engagement that men don't as generally have, and what
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:37.260]   if, therefore, women in general bring to relationships kinds of emotional support and healing that
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.580]   men don't as generally bring?
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:51.500]   What fool would say—what fool would say—that this is less valuable or less precious or
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:00.620]   less needed in the world than any particular kinds of cool, detached rationality that men
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.060]   in general might have?
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.280]   So again, I say this is just a caution, okay?
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:18.700]   This is just a caution lest we throw away beautiful things, crucial things that the
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:27.180]   world so desperately needs from men and women in our rush to see men and women as emotionally
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.580]   and rationally identical.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:40.380]   My guess is that there are innumerable differences between manhood and womanhood in general as
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:49.160]   God designed them, and that we are far and away the richer for it, not the poorer.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:58.340]   And I think we need to labor continually to prevent these differences from being demeaned
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:07.420]   or discounted by using pejorative words like "hyper-emotional," "irrational," "crazy,"
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.500]   "uncomprehensible," "unreasonable."
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:19.340]   Those kinds of demeaning stereotypes do not enhance the vision that God has for manhood
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.260]   and womanhood at all.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.260]   Amen.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:59.380]   Well, the Bible calls Christians to make peace, to be peacemakers.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:05.220]   It means we're called to the very uncomfortable ministry of entering ourselves into the conflicts
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.740]   of others.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.820]   So when do we know when to enter ourselves into the conflicts of others?
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.620]   That's a question on the table on Monday.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.620]   It's a good one.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.220]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
