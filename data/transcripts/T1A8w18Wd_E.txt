[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's not just important to spend one-on-one time with each child. I think it's also important to
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.080]   make sure you're carving out one-on-one time for each other if you have a partner, because it's
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.240]   really valuable for your kids to see that being a huge priority. And I think it also helps parents
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.840]   go at raising children in more of a unified way. Yeah, I think we regularly do date nights. And
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.440]   when our children say, "No, don't leave, don't leave." We say, "It's important for mommy and
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   daddy to have some time together too, just like you get to go on dates with mommy and daddy. And
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.560]   just like we have mommy and daddy play days, we need to spend time together." And I think I often
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.920]   hear some parents two, three, four years into having children that say, "Gosh, we haven't taken
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.080]   a date yet." And so we'll talk about childcare a little bit later, but I think it's really
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.000]   important. And I'm glad we've made time for that.
