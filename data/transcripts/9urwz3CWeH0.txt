[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   It's a joy to be with you this afternoon.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   My assignment for this hour is to speak on true greatness, defining spiritual leadership
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.120]   in terms of selfless service.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:32.560]   I want to do so by asking you to turn with me to Mark chapter 9, and I want us to meditate
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.680]   on a section of Mark 9 as we consider this subject this afternoon.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:54.960]   Mark chapter 9, I want you to note with me verse 30 through verse 37, "They went on from
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.120]   there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know, for He was teaching
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.760]   His disciples, saying to them, 'The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.880]   of men, and they will kill Him.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.520]   When He is killed, after three days He will rise.'
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.480]   But they did not understand the saying and were afraid to ask Him.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.240]   And they came to Capernaum, and when He was in the house, He asked them, 'What were you
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.980]   discussing on the way?'
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.240]   They kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.560]   greatest.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.680]   He sat down and called the twelve, and He said to them, 'If anyone would be first,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.480]   he must be last of all and servant of all.'
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.680]   And He took a child and put Him in the midst of them, and taking Him in His arms, He said
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.840]   to them, 'Whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.720]   Me receives not Me, but Him who sent Me.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   I am the Son of Man.'"
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:49.120]   7.51 a.m. on a Friday, June 12, 2007, a man in jeans, a t-shirt, and a ball cap arrived
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:02.840]   at the Washington, D.C. metro platform and played his violin there for 43 minutes.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:14.260]   During that time, 1,097 people passed by, most on their way to work.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.800]   Forty-seven people stopped to listen.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   Over those 43 minutes, 20 people tossed in a total of $32 in the open violin case that
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   sat at his feet.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:46.820]   That subway fiddler was the world-renowned and Grammy-winning musician Joshua Bell.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:59.600]   On a violin worth $3.5 million, Bell played six of the most intricate classical pieces
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.380]   ever written for the violin.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.180]   Two days prior, he performed a sold-out theater show in Boston, where the average seat cost
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.540]   $100.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.900]   Bell's stunt that day was a social experiment sponsored and organized by the Washington
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.260]   Post.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.800]   The experiment proved its point.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:40.540]   The average person doesn't recognize true greatness when it's in their midst.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:49.900]   Unfortunately, the same can be said of too many of us pastor-teachers.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.580]   Mark chapter 9, verses 30 through 37 is a divinely inspired social experiment.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.700]   The platform for this experiment is a journey through Galilee.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.180]   Jesus and His disciples were on the opening leg of His final journey.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:22.020]   This slow and long journey would ultimately end in Jerusalem, where Jesus would be betrayed,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:30.140]   arrested, condemned, crucified, and buried.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:39.740]   The previous verses of Mark 9 that lead up to our text record miraculous events.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:49.140]   The chapter begins with the glorious transfiguration of Jesus, where His divine nature shined through
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.140]   His human flesh.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.420]   And when Jesus descended from the mount of transfiguration, He healed a boy that was
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.620]   possessed by a demon that caused him suicidal seizures.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:13.520]   But when you get to our text, there are no miraculous events recorded, only conversations
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.580]   between Jesus and the disciples.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.440]   First, Jesus predicts His crucifixion and His resurrection.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:33.080]   Then the disciples, as they travel, argue with one another about who is the greatest.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.840]   And finally, Jesus teaches them what true greatness looks like.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:48.980]   The beginning of our text, the greatest person who ever lived announced that He would make
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:58.740]   the greatest sacrifice ever offered, but His closest followers did not understand what
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740]   He was talking about.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.460]   There's a sense in which they didn't want to understand.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.860]   The disciples no doubt believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah King, but they had
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.380]   wrong expectations about what the Messiah King would accomplish.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:28.760]   They were expecting military conquest, political revolution, and economic prosperity for Israel.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.920]   And of course, as His closest followers, the disciples expected top cabinet positions when
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.360]   these great things occurred.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   Being in the proximity of greatness would make them great, so they thought.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.940]   But none of this could be accomplished if Jesus was going to be delivered into the hands
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.560]   of men and killed.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.960]   And so, even as Jesus predicted these things would take place, the disciples literally
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.120]   blocked out of their mind the notion that any of this would come to pass.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   Here in our text, we feel the tension between the theology of the cross and the theology
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.860]   of glory.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:24.880]   In the theology of the cross, there is glory through suffering.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.080]   But in the theology of glory, there is glory without suffering.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.880]   This is what the disciples wanted and expected.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:41.520]   In the parallel, Matthew 18 verse 1 says, "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:48.780]   saying, 'Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'"
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:56.840]   This worldly question, unfortunately, often raises its ugly head among the disciples of
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:04.480]   Jesus today, including spiritual leaders.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   R.C.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.640]   Sproul wrote, "It seems that great is not good enough for us.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   We want to be determined to be the best of the best."
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   And we fail to recognize that the person in the front of the line is not necessarily the
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.540]   most important person in the line.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:35.560]   And so because we confuse prominence with significance, too many pastors are driven,
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:50.040]   prideful, frustrated, discouraged, burned out by a futile pursuit of so-called greatness.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   We ask the question of greatness with the wrong motives, and we accept the wrong answers
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.440]   to the question of greatness.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   But in our text, Jesus answers the question of greatness once and for all.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   His answer is countercultural.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:19.680]   In fact, it would be better to say that His answer is supracultural.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:36.840]   Very simply, here Jesus teaches us, brothers, that as Christians, we descend into greatness.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   J.C.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.400]   Ryle commenting here said that this fact is recorded for our learning.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.600]   The Holy Ghost has caused it to be written down for the perpetual use of Christ's church.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.560]   Let us take care that it was not written in vain.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.040]   So the question on the table this afternoon, brothers, is this, "What is true greatness?"
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:09.120]   And I just want to walk you through Mark chapter 9, verses 30 through 37, and here I want you
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:17.520]   to see two characteristics of true greatness as Jesus defines it.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:26.840]   First, true greatness suffers.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.960]   True greatness suffers.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:42.040]   Verse 30 says, "They went on from there and passed through Galilee."
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:48.600]   The publicity surrounding the healing of the demon-possessed boy made it impossible for
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.440]   Jesus to remain where He was.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   So Jesus and the disciples passed through Galilee.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.040]   There is a sense in which this marks the end of the public ministry of Jesus, as Mark will
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.100]   tell the story.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.520]   Without a doubt here, it is clear He is no longer focused on the people of Israel.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:20.300]   It is now His priority to teach His disciples in preparation for the things that will come.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.280]   And this is what you find in verses 30 through 32.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.320]   Jesus is teaching His disciples.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:37.060]   Notice three aspects of the lesson He teaches them.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.600]   It is, first of all, a private lesson.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.960]   Verse 30 says that He did not want anyone to know.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.120]   Don't miss the magnitude of that subtle statement.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:59.680]   It is a reminder that Jesus is not as impressed with crowds as we are.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:11.780]   Sure, Jesus loved people, but He did not need the affirmation of people to validate Him.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:19.060]   Jesus was wise enough to know that catering to crowds can shift the priority of the mission.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:30.400]   And so He passed through Galilee inconspicuously, not wanting anyone to know.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.720]   The text tells us why at the top of verse 31, "For He was teaching His disciples."
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:45.640]   At this point, there were still many needs to meet, many bodies to heal, many demons
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:52.280]   to exercise, but Jesus had more important work to do.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.640]   His time on earth was coming to an end, and that time left must be used strategically
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.120]   if His kingdom work was to continue after His departure.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:12.760]   So Jesus prioritized private time with His disciples to teach them.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.640]   He still does.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:29.680]   Brothers, Jesus wants to spend private time with you.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:42.840]   Mark it down, crowds, noise, and hurry will short-circuit your spiritual effectiveness.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:51.880]   Crowds, noise, and hurry will short-circuit your spiritual effectiveness, your spiritual
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:57.600]   devotion, your spiritual maturity to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:07.040]   You've got to learn how to get alone, quiet the noise, and slow down to be with Jesus.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:18.520]   What life lessons are you missing because you are not spending time alone with Jesus?
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:26.000]   A couple of years ago, I was in the car with a pastor friend.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.420]   It mentioned that he attended a conference that I wanted to attend and was not able to,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.160]   and I was asking him about the event, asked him who spoke.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.320]   He mentioned the name of a pastor that I had heard of but had never heard speak before,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.440]   and I asked him, "Is he a strong preacher?"
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.800]   "Absolutely," my friend replied.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:05.320]   He says, "And as he's preaching, it's obvious that he's been with Jesus."
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.360]   What a great statement.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.880]   I didn't ask any more questions, I couldn't.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.560]   I just felt the weight of that answer.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.920]   Of course, you know this as a reference to Acts chapter 4, verse 13, where in the midst
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:27.160]   of persecution, the authorities recognized that these untrained Galileans had been with
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.240]   Jesus.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   The same should be said of every pastor teacher.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:42.560]   It should be evident in your private life and your public ministry that you have been
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.720]   with Jesus.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:53.320]   So in the text, we see a private lesson, and then secondly, a prophetic lesson.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:02.640]   Verse 31 says, "He was teaching His disciples, saying to them, 'The Son of Man is going to
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.240]   be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:15.960]   And when He is killed, after three days, He will rise.'"
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:22.160]   This is the second of three times in Mark's gospel Jesus predicted to His disciples His
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:29.040]   crucifixion and His resurrection that is to come.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:40.240]   Listen to the language here, "Jesus would be delivered into the hands of men."
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.080]   What a thought!
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.200]   The one that they had been with and watched Him steal the seeds, cast out demons, and
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.160]   heal the sick would be delivered into the hands of men.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.780]   He would be delivered into the hands of men by the betrayal of Judas.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:12.280]   Moreover, He would be delivered into the hands of men by the divine plan of God the Father.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:20.480]   Acts chapter 2 verse 23, Peter will say, "This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:31.320]   plan and foreknowledge of God, You crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men."
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.440]   That's the historical truth of it.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.920]   Romans 4:25 states the theological truth of it.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:46.480]   He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:57.620]   Jesus would be delivered into the hands of men, and then they would kill Him.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:06.520]   He doesn't merely say He's going to die, He says He will be killed.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.080]   He says it twice here.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.160]   The double use of "kill" emphasizes the violent nature of His death.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:26.720]   It was cruel and unusual punishment for a righteous man who had done no wrong.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:34.880]   Isaiah tells us, though, He was wounded for our transgressions.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.560]   He was bruised for our iniquity.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.440]   The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.720]   Oh, we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:54.120]   We have turned everyone to his own way, but the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.800]   all.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.200]   Jesus declared to them what was to come when they arrived in Jerusalem.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.120]   He would be delivered into the hands of men, and they would kill Him.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.080]   But thanks be to God, brothers, that's not the end of the story.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:27.720]   Jesus says, "And when He is killed, after three days He will rise."
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:40.620]   No one survived a Roman crucifixion, but Jesus would die on the cross and yet live to tell
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.380]   about it.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.680]   Not just that, He foretold it before it ever happened.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:58.000]   He would rise from the dead by divine might and power and authority, and not only did
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.780]   Jesus predict His resurrection, He predicted when it would happen.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:13.180]   After three days, He will rise again.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:19.820]   Jesus is sovereign over the worst that could happen, death itself.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:28.480]   And so, after this prophetic lesson, would you note thirdly here in this first section
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:39.420]   that Jesus gives them a private lesson, a prophetic lesson, and then a perplexing lesson.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:49.700]   Verse 32 says, "They did not understand what He was saying and were too afraid to ask."
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:56.100]   The disciples' messianic expectations had no place for crucifixion.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:05.300]   How could one who came to restore Israel die before that happened?
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   And resurrection was even more perplexing to them than crucifixion.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.700]   The Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection, and the rest of the Jews believed that there
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.100]   would be a general resurrection on the day of the Lord.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:26.300]   They did not have a category for a person rising from the dead after he died.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:31.260]   And they didn't understand what Jesus was talking about, even though this is the second
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:37.780]   time He predicts His crucifixion and His resurrection.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:45.860]   The disciples did not understand, but they were afraid to ask.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:23:00.980]   Go to Acts chapter 8 after the great confession, in verses 27 through 30.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:11.060]   After that great confession, Jesus gives His first prediction that He would die and rise
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.060]   from the dead.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:21.220]   In Mark chapter 8, verse 32 and 33 says, "And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:29.460]   But turning and seeing the disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, 'Get behind Me, Satan!
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:38.580]   For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.'"
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:48.660]   And so, maybe they were afraid to ask because they didn't want to be called Satan.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:54.900]   Or perhaps at this point they were afraid to ask because they understood enough to know
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   that they didn't want to learn more.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.620]   Consider these next two sentences very carefully, brothers.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:16.960]   Self-centeredness avoids the cross.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:29.180]   But to avoid the cross is to stop following Jesus.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.740]   I'm moving on, but just let me pause here to say before I move on.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:40.600]   That it is not accidental or incidental that the Lord's prediction of His suffering and
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:53.180]   death immediately precedes His instructions about greatness.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:25:01.220]   You don't understand greatness until you see the One who made everything hanging on the
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.580]   cross for your sins and mine.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:12.740]   True greatness is not defined, brothers, by power, position, prominence, popularity, or
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.260]   possessions.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:22.300]   It is measured by the cross where Jesus suffered and died for our sins.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:30.660]   And so, very clearly here we see that greatness is not about success.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:37.940]   In the real sense, it's about what are you willing to suffer for the One who suffered
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.020]   for you.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:49.420]   Galatians chapter 6 verse 14, "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:26:02.580]   our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:09.140]   In an interview before his death, Carl Henry was commended for his humility, and he objected
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:22.660]   to the compliment, asking, "How can anyone be anything but humble when you're standing
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:30.040]   next to the cross?"
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:39.820]   So may that be our constant prayer.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.580]   Jesus keep me near the cross.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:52.500]   There's a precious fountain free to all, a healing stream that flows from Calvary's mountain.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:27:03.920]   In the cross, in the cross be my glory forever, till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.780]   the river.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.180]   In our text, Jesus gives two lessons about what true greatness is all about.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.700]   We have seen the first.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.220]   True greatness suffers.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.540]   There is a second lesson.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:26.620]   True greatness serves.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.900]   True greatness suffers.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.060]   True greatness serves.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:43.380]   The text begins with Jesus and the disciples passing through Galilee.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:54.540]   At some point, they arrive in Capernaum, the headquarters of the Galilean ministry of Jesus.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:02.620]   They enter the house, maybe Peter's house, maybe Andrew's house, and it is there that
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.980]   the question of greatness arises.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:20.200]   They did not understand the greatness of Jesus, and they misunderstood their own lack of greatness.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:31.360]   So, in verses 33 through 37, Jesus teaches what true greatness means.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:39.460]   It is servanthood, not lordship.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:45.100]   Here Arkyn Hughes comments that there is a mindset that defines ministry as a kind of
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:51.700]   lordship, sitting in the honored seat, being the feeded guest at luncheon, speaking to
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:57.180]   vast thrones, building monuments, and collecting honorary titles.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:06.920]   This type of attitude values being served.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:13.960]   That is not what discipleship is about, much less what ministry is about.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.240]   It is not what discipleship is about.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.180]   It is not what leadership is about.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:25.320]   It is not what greatness is about.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.560]   And what does it mean to be great?
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.800]   Two answers.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:41.280]   Being the last and receiving the least.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.620]   What is true greatness all about?
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:48.760]   First, it is about being the last.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.720]   Verse 33 says, "And they came to Capernaum.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:00.080]   And when he was in the house, he asked them, 'What were you discussing on the way?'"
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:08.760]   So, you already know, brothers, when Jesus asks a question, He's not trying to gain information.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:18.840]   It's like a parent asking a child, "What are you in there doing?"
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:27.320]   He already knows it is something you should not be doing.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:39.840]   Note "asked" in the text is in a grammatical emphasis that indicates He kept asking.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.800]   Jesus was demanding to know what they were talking about.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:53.440]   The disciples apparently followed Jesus to Capernaum from a distance, and as they were
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:01.680]   walking behind Him, apparently, they had among themselves what they thought was a private
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.480]   conversation.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.240]   But Jesus knew what they had discussed.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:15.360]   We're tempted to giggle at that, but just remember the implications of that for our
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.920]   own lives.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.720]   How would your conversations change if you believe Jesus was listening to everything
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:28.880]   you say?
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.000]   Verse 34 says, "But they kept silent.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.720]   For on the way, they had argued with one another about who was the greatest."
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:47.360]   As Jesus kept asking, the disciples remained silent.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:55.780]   It was the silence of shame.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:02.400]   They were embarrassed that they were arguing.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.800]   Verse 14, earlier in the chapter, "They were arguing with the scribes, but now they are
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   arguing with one another."
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.760]   And they are arguing about who was the greatest.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.280]   It's the question as old as time.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.500]   Who's number one?
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.920]   Listen to the language of the text.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.240]   They are not asking who will be the greatest one day.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.800]   They are arguing about who's the greatest now.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:50.860]   Charles Spurgeon said of this text, "It was a dreadful descent from communing with Moses
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:56.080]   and Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration to meeting the furious demon at the foot of
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.200]   the hill."
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:05.400]   But this looks like a far greater descent from the self-sacrifice of the divine Master
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:16.000]   to the petty jealousies and self-seeking of His chosen servants.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.740]   So Jesus intervenes.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.880]   Verse 39, "He sat down and called the twelve."
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.400]   That is, Jesus took the teaching posture and began a formal lesson.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:35.440]   This instruction consisted of a paradoxical statement.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:46.400]   If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.200]   Would you note, brothers, that Jesus does not here rebuke the desire or the determination
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:59.400]   to be great.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:06.800]   He rebukes the wrong path to greatness.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.080]   What is the right way to achieve greatness?
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:20.360]   Jesus says to be first is to be last.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:31.840]   Last to be the spirit of spiritual leaders, not an argument to try to get to the front
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:46.600]   of the line, but a willingness to go to the back of the line.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:52.680]   In Matthew 19, you remember there the encounter Jesus has with the rich young ruler.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:35:04.080]   It's one of the sad passages of the Bible, one of the sad encounters Jesus has.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.320]   The rich young ruler has eternal life offered to him, but he walks away sorrowful because
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:20.400]   he had many possessions, or maybe it could be said his possessions had him.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.960]   But as sad as that story is, it gets worse.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:31.240]   You remember that when the rich young ruler walks away, Jesus tries to warn His disciples
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:38.800]   about the spiritual dangers of material wealth.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.440]   You know what their reply is?
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   "Lord, we gave up everything to follow You, what will we get out of it?"
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:02.560]   In Matthew 20, Jesus tells that parable about the landowner who keeps going out throughout
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   the course of the day collecting workers for his field, and at the end of the day, just
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:25.040]   for the fun of it, he pays the latecomers first and the early birds last and gives them
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:30.400]   all the same amount.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.520]   Remember the story?
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:40.000]   Those early birds wanted to give the landowner a piece of their mind.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.320]   "We've labored all day and borne the burden.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.360]   You made these men equal with us."
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:56.640]   You need to go back and read that parable in Matthew 20 and see if you can hear the
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:05.920]   Lord Jesus talk to you as the landowner talks to those angry early birds.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.920]   Have I wronged you?
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:18.520]   Here's the big question, don't I have the right to do what I want to do with what belongs
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:27.480]   to me?
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   Or are you just envious because I decided to be generous to somebody, not you?
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.120]   The whole passage ends in Matthew 20 verse 16 with the principle here that Jesus confronts
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:51.720]   us with, "So the last will be first and the first last."
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.400]   Jesus says you want to be first?
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:38:00.660]   Don't fight for first place, just get to the back of the line.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.900]   How do you get there?
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:16.300]   Jesus says, "Be servant of all."
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:27.700]   The Disciples Study Bible notes here that Christ teaches only one office, God's slave.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:38.960]   Willful, joyful, obedient service for Christ is expressed by putting the concerns and interests
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:46.780]   and benefits of others ahead of our own.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:52.660]   Here's our problem, even as ministers, there are times that we want to be thought of as
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:39:04.100]   servants without being treated as servants, but it doesn't work that way.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:14.660]   The test of servanthood is how you respond when someone treats you like a servant.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.580]   Hebrew commerce humility and service are not only the passport to greatness in Christ's
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:26.980]   kingdom, but also the very essence of greatness in His kingdom.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.620]   So what is greatness all about?
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:36.780]   It is, first of all, it is being the last, and then Jesus says in verse 36 and 37, "It
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.540]   is also receiving the least."
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:45.980]   And He took a child and put him in the midst of them.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.620]   Now, don't read that too quickly.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.220]   Remember the implications of this.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:59.100]   Little children were viewed and treated as the most insignificant people in the Greco-Roman
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100]   world.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.780]   At birth, the newborn would be placed at his father's feet.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.820]   If he picked up the child, it was an act of acknowledgement, affirmation, and adoption.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.940]   If not, the child was put to death.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:19.180]   The bottom line is that children had no rights, and there were no orphanages, foster care,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.380]   welfare system.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:29.860]   Children then would make the perfect illustration of weakness, neediness, and helplessness.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:35.820]   Now hear the text again, "Jesus took a child and sat that child in the midst of the disciples
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:44.940]   who are arguing about who's the greatest."
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:50.020]   I like these little touches Mark gives of the tenderness of Jesus.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.700]   You see it here in this text.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:41:07.540]   He brought the child into the midst of these arguing disciples and He took him in His arms.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:16.780]   Holding this child in His arms, Jesus now has the text for a sermon He wants to preach.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:23.280]   He says, "Whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.300]   Me receives not Me but him who sent Me."
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.380]   The key word here is "receives" is used four times.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.580]   In the next chapter, Mark 10 verse 15, Jesus says, "Truly I say to you, whoever does not
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:44.380]   receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall not enter it."
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:50.180]   Childlikeness is how you become a Christian.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:57.460]   We enter into the kingdom of God by childlike dependence upon the total sufficiency of Christ.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:06.140]   We follow Him by trust and obedience that submits every sphere of our lives to His authority.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:15.660]   On one occasion, the famous Chicago evangelist, Dwight L. Moody, once returned from a meeting
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:25.880]   and reported two-and-a-half conversions.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:32.340]   Someone said, "I suppose you mean two adults and one child."
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:41.220]   "No," said Moody, "it was actually two children and one adult."
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:43:01.820]   The children gave their whole lives; the adult only had half his life to give.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.460]   We are to be like children and give Him all.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.580]   We are saved by childlike trust, not righteous acts.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.380]   But in our text, Jesus is not talking about how to become a Christian.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:19.340]   Remember, He's talking about how Christians, how disciples, how ministers become great.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:28.300]   And He says, "Whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me."
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.620]   The world thinks, brothers, it's not what you know but who you know.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:43.940]   And so we try to associate ourselves with those who are considered great.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:49.660]   Here Jesus says we should welcome those who are considered insignificant.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:57.380]   We should show care and concern for the inconsequential in the name of Jesus, and to do so is to receive
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:02.220]   Jesus Himself.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:10.960]   Remember the parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 verses 31 through 46?
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:19.540]   Jesus renders judgment on the sheep and the goats, the sheep to His right hand, goats
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:24.420]   on His left.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:34.900]   And then He tells the criteria of judgment of the nations, and that criteria is how the
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:43.740]   nations treated Him when He was hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, a stranger, or in prison.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.520]   And what blows me away about that parable is that both groups, those that got it right
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:58.500]   and those that got it wrong, have the same question, "When did we ever see you like that?"
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:09.420]   And as much as you did it to the least of these, my brothers, you did it unto Me.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.780]   That's not all.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.540]   Jesus says, "Whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.580]   Me receives not Me, but Him who sent Me."
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:26.100]   Do you see the progression here?
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:31.220]   To receive a little child is to receive Christ Himself, and to receive God the Son is to
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.060]   receive God the Father.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:40.100]   I'm wrapping up.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:45.500]   And so, as Jesus is prone to do, what He basically says in His answer is, "You've got to hold
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   question wrong."
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:46:06.260]   At the top of the talk, I said the question is, "Who is the greatest?"
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:14.300]   Now, at the end of the text, though, we see the real question is this, brothers.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:24.620]   How high can the Lord lift you without losing you?
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:37.420]   Are you pursuing worldly greatness or the true greatness that suffers and serves?
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:50.300]   Dawson Trotman, the founder of the Navigators, was going through a difficult period and felt
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.820]   he needed to get ready for something that was about to change.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:02.460]   His wife didn't understand what he was thinking or feeling, but she knew him well enough to
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:08.360]   know that when he started talking that way, she should take him seriously.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:17.080]   So they pulled away from their work to pray and rest, to seek God.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:26.580]   They spent some of that time at Word of Life on Shrewn Lake in New York.
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:34.380]   One day, while riding a boat with Jack Wurtson, the founder of Word of Life, and a few other
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:43.380]   campers, they hit some choppy water on that lake.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:51.580]   Dawson and a female camper fell off the boat.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:48:04.180]   Dawson held up the young lady until she was rescued, but in the process drowned in Shrewn
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:11.460]   Lake.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:26.380]   But at his funeral days later, the eulogists noticed that Trotman Dawson died the same
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:36.360]   way he lived, holding others up.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.320]   That's true greatness.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.040]   I am thine, O Lord.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.260]   I have heard thy voice, and it told thy love to me.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.260]   But I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.780]   Here's my verse.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.700]   Here's the great prayer we should pray.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:07.180]   Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord, by the power of grace divine.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:15.060]   Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, and let my will be lost in thine.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:23.060]   Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where thou hast died.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:34.220]   Draw me nearer, nearer, precious Lord, to thy blessed bleeding side.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:38.820]   Let's pray.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:47.980]   Father, we recognize that there are so many temptations around us that would lead us astray,
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:50:00.300]   temptations of the flesh, the world, and the devil that would pervert our calling and assignment
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:06.660]   and mission to exalt ourselves rather than exalting Christ.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:18.980]   Lord, would you help us to guard our hearts, knowing that from it flow the issues of life?
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:25.400]   Would you help us to bring every sphere of our lives under subjection to the lordship
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.660]   of Jesus Christ?
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:38.140]   And would you help us, Lord, to ignore, to reject, to condemn the worldly standards of
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:48.820]   personal success that have like a snake slipped and slithered into the church of Jesus Christ?
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:54.860]   May we look at Jesus who died at the cross for us and remember that true greatness suffers,
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:01.620]   and may we remember his illustration of the helpless child and remember that true greatness
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.500]   serves.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:12.500]   And may that be, Lord, our devotion and our dedication to the place where you have assigned
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:17.900]   us to minister, even if that is a difficult place.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:23.460]   May we be willing to suffer and serve to the praise of your glory, knowing that when the
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:29.140]   chief Shepherd comes, we will receive the crown of life.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.940]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.980]   Thank you, brothers.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:41.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
