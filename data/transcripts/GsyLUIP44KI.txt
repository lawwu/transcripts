[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   I take the founder role very seriously.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   If the founder slot is filled,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.640]   you have incredible ability to change the company.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.280]   The key thing is subtraction.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.040]   And this is where the founder slot's energy comes from.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.720]   It seems to me that it's only founders
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.400]   who subtract in companies.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.600]   This is the meeting thing in a nutshell.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.920]   Everyone adds recurring meetings and gums up the system.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.280]   I'm super pro great meetings,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.080]   but once every couple, year and a half or so,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.840]   we randomly delete all recurring meetings.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.080]   We're actually gonna do random deletion of Slack channels
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.120]   and all these kind of things,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.760]   just because they will come back if they are useful.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.920]   So I think that gives you a sense.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.200]   Well, I don't think I have time for dissertation,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.560]   but again, it's super fun building companies.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.800]   you
