[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420]   - You said the freedom number people need
[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.660]   is a lot smaller than you think.
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.120]   - For me, it always seemed risky, this freedom number,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.520]   the way I realized it, and I've noticed
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.760]   that a lot of other entrepreneurs have had,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.480]   it always seems so risky to have these day jobs.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.000]   And then I thought, oh man, entrepreneurship,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I don't know how much I have to make.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.480]   And then I recognized, well, how much do I need
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.140]   to really be able to do the thing I wanna do
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.980]   and have freedom?
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.600]   And it was way less than I expected.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.200]   And it really came down to three categories,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.020]   which is living, food, savings.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.720]   And for me, it was $3,000.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.000]   And when I was at my day job, I was like,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.640]   well, if I can get the side hustle to that number,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.040]   then I can quit.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.480]   And I never encouraged people
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.280]   to actually go take a risky thing.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.280]   It seemed risky to quit your job
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.920]   to try to hopefully start a business.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.960]   It's not what I want people to do.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.040]   And when you realize how much smaller that number is
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.680]   than you expect, you realize it's also more attainable.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.080]   And so I've twice quit jobs and then gone on
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.960]   once I hit my $3,000 freedom number.
