[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   At any given moment, what money is just seems like the natural state of the world, right?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.380]   Most people, most of the time, don't really think about it.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.100]   They just think, "Oh, yes, this piece of paper in my wallet, this number in my account, that's
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.100]   what money is.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.240]   Fine, whatever.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.700]   That's just the way the world works."
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.880]   But the lesson, the insight to me that was really interesting, exciting is that's not
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.440]   necessarily the way the world works.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.680]   It didn't used to work that way.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.720]   It'll probably be different in the future.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.280]   And so that's what's fun.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.840]   Money turns out to be this set of rules, this set of arrangements that a society agrees
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.640]   on without really realizing that they're agreeing on something quite often.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.600]   It is kind of emergent and it's kind of bottom-up more than you might think, rather than let's
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960]   have a constitutional convention and decide what money is.
