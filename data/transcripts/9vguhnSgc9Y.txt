[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   I just started reading about the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy about 2,000 years ago,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:15.360]   and it turns out that when Vesuvius erupted, it was AD 79, it destroyed all the nearby towns.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.760]   Everyone knows about Pompeii, but there was another nearby town called Herculaneum,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.120]   and Herculaneum was sort of like the Beverly Hills to Pompeii, so big villas, big houses,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.680]   fancy people. And in Herculaneum, there was one villa in particular that was enormous,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.680]   and it had once been owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar, and so, well-connected guy.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   And it was full of beautiful statues and marbles and art, but it was also the home to a huge
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.720]   library of papyrus scrolls. And so when the villa was buried, the volcano actually, it spit out
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.320]   enormous quantities of mud and ash, and it buried Herculaneum in particular in something like 20
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.400]   meters of material. So it wasn't like a thin layer. It was a very thick layer.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.360]   Those towns were buried and forgotten for hundreds of years. No one even knew exactly
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.240]   where they were until the 1700s. And so in 1750, a farm worker who was digging a well
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.720]   kind of in the outskirts of Herculaneum struck this marble paving stone of a path that had been
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.800]   at this huge villa. And of course, he was pretty far down when he did that. He was 60 feet down.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.200]   And then subsequently, this Swiss engineer came in and started digging tunnels from that well shaft,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.640]   and they found all these treasures. And that was sort of the spirit at the time was like looting.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.040]   They were taking out like incredible, if they encountered a wall, they would just bust through
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   it. And they were taking out these beautiful bronze statues that had survived. And along the
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.720]   way, they kept encountering these lumps of what looked like charcoal. They weren't sure what they
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.240]   were, and many were apparently thrown away until someone noticed a little bit of writing on one of
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.960]   them. And they realized they were papyrus scrolls. And there were hundreds, there may have been
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.840]   thousands of them. And so they had uncovered really this enormous library is the only library
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.600]   ever to have sort of survived in any form, even though it was badly damaged. They were sort of
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.320]   carbonized, very fragile, deformed. The only one that survived since antiquity. In the open air,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.280]   these papyrus scrolls in like a Mediterranean climate, they rot and they decay quickly. And
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.520]   so they'd have to be recopied by monks like every hundred years or so, maybe even less.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.280]   And so we only have, it's estimated, you know, something like less than 1%, less than 1%
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.720]   of all the writing from that period. And so to find underground hundreds of definitely
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.200]   not in good condition, but still present, you know, papyrus scrolls were on a few of them,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.280]   you can make out the lettering was like this enormous discovery. People immediately in a
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.480]   well-meaning attempt to read them started trying to open them. But they're, they're really fragile,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.200]   like, you know, they're like, they turn to ash in your hand. And so hundreds were destroyed.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.480]   People did things like cut them with daggers down the middle. And, you know, a bunch of little
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.400]   pieces would flake off and they'd try to like, get a few letters off of a couple of pieces.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.600]   And then eventually there was a monk named Piaggio, who's an Italian monk.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.880]   And he devised this machine kind of under the care of the Vatican to unroll these things very,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.360]   very slowly, like half a centimeter a day, something like that. And a typical scroll,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.320]   I think, could be 15 or 20 or 30 feet long, and managed to successfully unroll a few of these.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.240]   And they found on them, Greek philosophical texts in the Epicurean tradition by this little known
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.000]   philosopher named Philodemus. But we got kind of new text from antiquity, which is not a thing that
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.080]   happens all the time. Eventually, people stopped trying to physically unroll these things because
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.920]   so many were destroyed. And in fact, some attempts to physically unroll the scrolls continued even
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.120]   into like the 2000s, like 1990s, 2000s, and, and they were destroyed. So the current situation is
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.400]   we have 600 plus kind of roughly intact scrolls that we can't open. And I heard, I heard about
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.320]   this, and I thought that was incredibly exciting, like the idea that there was information from
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.040]   2000 years in the past, we don't know what's in these things. And obviously, people are trying
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.680]   to develop new ways and new technologies to open them. And I read about a professor
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   at the University of Kentucky, Brent Seals, who had been trying to scan these using increasingly
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.480]   advanced imaging techniques, and then use computer vision techniques and machine learning
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.880]   to kind of virtually unroll them without ever opening them. And they tried a lot of different
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.160]   things. But their most recent attempt in 2019 was to take the scrolls to a particle accelerator
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.640]   in Oxford, England, called the Diamond Flight Source, and to make essentially an incredibly
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.200]   high resolution CT scan of the sort of 3D x-ray scan. And they needed really high energy photons
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.160]   in order to do this, and they were able to take scans at eight microns, so these really quite
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.640]   tiny voxels, which they thought would be sufficient. And I thought this was like the coolest
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.840]   thing ever. You know, we're using technology to sort of read this lost information from the past,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.680]   and I sort of waited for the news that they had been decoded successfully. So that was, you know,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.400]   2020. And then I think COVID hit, everybody got a little bit slowed down by that. And last year,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   I found myself wondering, I wonder what happened to, you know, Dr. Seals and his scroll project.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.880]   And I reached out, and it turned out they'd been making really good progress. You know,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.960]   they'd gotten some machine learning models to start to identify ink inside of the scrolls,
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   but they hadn't yet extracted words or passages. It's very challenging. And I invited him to come
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:10.480]   out to California and hang out, and to my shock, he did. And we got to talking and decided to team
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.200]   up and try to crack this thing. And the approach that we've settled on to do that is to actually
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.520]   launch an open competition. We're going to, we've done a ton of work with his team to get the data
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.280]   into a shape where, and the tools and techniques and just the broad understanding of the materials
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   into a shape where smart people can kind of approach it and get productive easily. And then
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.280]   I'm putting up together with Daniel Gross, a prize, you know, sort of like an X prize or something
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.880]   like that for the first person or team who can actually read like substantial amounts of real
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.640]   text from one of these scrolls without opening them. And so we're launching that this week,
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.760]   you know, I guess maybe it's when, when this airs, I don't know. The stakes are kind of big,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.480]   like this, like what gets me excited are the stakes. So the six or 800 scrolls that are there,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.920]   it's estimated that if we could read all of them and, you know, somehow the technique works and it
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.720]   generalizes to all the scrolls, then that would give us approximately a doubling of the total
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.400]   text that we have from antiquity. This is what historians and classicists tell me. So it's not
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.840]   like, oh, we would get like a 5% bump or a 10% bump in the total ancient Roman or Greek text.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.240]   It would be like, no, we get all of the texts that we have. Again, you know, multiple Shakespeare's
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.720]   is sort of one of the units that I've heard. So, so that, that would be significant. I mean,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.640]   we don't know what's in there. You know, we've got a few Philodemus texts. Those are
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:46.320]   of some interest, but there could be lost epic poems or God knows what. So I'm really excited.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:53.600]   And I think, you know, my bet is there's like a 50% chance that someone will encounter this
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.640]   opportunity and get the data and get nerd sniped by it. And we'll solve it this year.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.040]   Um, I want to make tangible, like what could be gained if we can unwrap these?
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.240]   So you said there's a few more thousand scrolls. Are we talking about the ones in a Philodemus's
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.080]   layer? Are we talking about the ones in other layers? You know, you'd think if you find this
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.800]   crazy Villa that was owned by Julius Caesar's father-in-law that we just like dig the whole
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:24.320]   thing out. Um, but in fact, most of the exploration occurred in the 1700s through the Swiss engineers
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.640]   tunnels underground. So it was never, the Villa was never dug out and exposed to the air.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.760]   You went down 50, 60 feet and then you dig tunnels. And, you know, again, they were looking
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.360]   for treasure, not like a full archeological exploration. So they mostly got treasure.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.480]   In the nineties, some additional excavations were done kind of at the edge of the Villa.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.240]   And they discovered a couple of things. First, they discovered this, like it was a seaside Villa
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.360]   that faced the ocean. It was right on the water before the volcano erupted. The eruption actually
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.440]   pushed the shoreline out by depositing so much additional mud there. So it's no longer right by
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.520]   the ocean, apparently. I've actually never been. And they also found that there were two additional
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:12.400]   floors in the Villa that the tunnels apparently had never excavated. And so at most, a third of
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.440]   the Villa has been excavated. Now they also know when they were discovering these papyrus scrolls
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.080]   that they found basically one little room where most of the scrolls were. And these were mostly
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.400]   these Philodemus texts, at least that's what we know. And they found apparently several revisions,
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.760]   sometimes at the same text. And so they think the hypothesis is this was actually Philodemus's
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:42.880]   working library. He worked here, this sort of Epicurean philosopher. And in the hallways though,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.800]   they occasionally found other scrolls, including crates of them. And the belief is, at least this
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.840]   is what historians have told me, and I'm no expert, but what they have told me is they think
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.360]   that the main library in this Villa has probably not been excavated. And that the main library may
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:07.040]   be a Latin library and may contain literary texts, historical texts, other things. And that it could
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.000]   be much larger. Now I don't know how prone these classicists are to wishful thinking. It is a
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.600]   romantic idea, but they have some evidence in the presence of these partly evacuated sort of
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.200]   scrolls that were found in hallways and that sort of thing. So there are descriptions. I've since
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.320]   gone and read a bunch of the first-hand accounts of the excavations. And there are these heartbreaking
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.560]   descriptions of them finding an entire case of scrolls in Latin and accidentally destroying it
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.400]   as they tried to get it out of the mud. And there were maybe 30 scrolls or something in there.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.640]   So there clearly was some other stuff that we just haven't got to.
