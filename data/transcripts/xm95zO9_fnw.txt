[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   We're back.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.880]   Thanks for listening to Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.600]   I'm a longtime pastor and author, John Piper.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.320]   Today's question is a bit technical, so bear with us, but it's a really important one,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320]   too.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   It's weighty.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.320]   Here it is.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.600]   "What active role does God play in both the redemption of sinners and in the perdition
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   of sinners?"
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   Casey asks it.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   Here's his question.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.080]   I was studying Romans 9, verses 22 to 23.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.080]   I see that the Greek word Paul uses for 'prepared' in verse 22, 'katertismina', is different
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.320]   from the word he uses for 'prepared' in verse 23, 'proitoi misin'.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.300]   The first root is artiso.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.080]   The second is etymus.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   Additionally, the first is passive, the second is active.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.280]   Can you explain the significance and meaning of why Paul would use different words and
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.560]   tenses here?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.240]   Specifically, does this imply that the vessels of destruction were prepared differently than
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.520]   the vessels of mercy?"
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.160]   Well, first, for those who feel like this question is just too technical, they're going
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.880]   to click us off here right away, let me ask for just a couple minutes to show otherwise,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.760]   because it relates to one of the most ultimate, important things you can ever think about.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.120]   So what's at stake?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.560]   What's at stake is how God's power and wisdom and justice and mercy are at work in those
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.200]   who finally perish and how they are at work in those who are finally saved.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.200]   And few things could be more important than clarifying the relationship between God's
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.840]   sovereignty and the final destiny of human beings.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.640]   The text—and I believe this—the text in all the Bible that comes closest to getting
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.700]   at God's ultimate design or purpose in His sovereign work in salvation and in judgment
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.440]   is Romans 9, 21 to 23.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.640]   So I'm going to read it because this is what is being asked about.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.200]   "Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.120]   use and another vessel for dishonorable use?
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.740]   If God, desiring to show His wrath and to make known His power, has endured with much
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.420]   patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order to make known the riches of His glory
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.240]   for vessels of mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory…"
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.760]   And then the sentence breaks off.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.600]   And that's why most translations don't start with "if God desiring," they start
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.840]   with "what if God desiring," because they're implying rightly that if He has done it this
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.160]   way, then no legitimate objection can be raised.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   That's the gist.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.000]   So here's the essential, amazing, ultimate statement being made by Paul about God's
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.560]   ultimate purposes.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.080]   He's saying God aims to show—very important word—to show, especially for you, Tony,
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   who wrote the book, right?
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   Right.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   The spectacle.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.360]   Everybody should buy Tony's book.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.400]   God aims to show His wrath against sin and to show His power as supreme and to manifest
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.040]   His patience and His mercy, that is, all the riches of His glory, He aims to show these.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.200]   That's His purpose in verse 22.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.160]   That's the word used in verse 22, "to show," and this is why He created the world and is
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   governing history and is saving and judging the world.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:08.080]   All of these attributes are mentioned as part of God's plan—wrath, power, patience, mercy,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.320]   glory.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.840]   In other words, God's ultimate aim in salvation and judgment is to display and communicate
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:25.880]   to His creatures the entire range, the entire panorama of His attributes or His being.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:34.080]   And I just want to pause here and say, oh, oh, the value, the value of grasping and believing
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.240]   that this is God's ultimate great goal in the universe.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.800]   It changed my life totally 50 years ago to get a handle on God's God-centeredness in
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.680]   creating the world.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:56.480]   No attribute of God that can be revealed for His glory shall be left in obscurity.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:07.040]   His aim in creation and salvation and judgment is to reveal all the fullness of His glory,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   including the justice of His wrath and the beauty of His mercy.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.960]   Now what Cayce is drawing our attention to in the question is that this revelation of
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.200]   the fullness of God's glory involves the demonstration of righteous wrath in judgment
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.480]   on one group of people and the demonstration of righteous mercy on another group, and you
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:42.640]   can see from the word "mercy" and "wrath" that neither deserve salvation.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.120]   You wouldn't need mercy if one were good, and wrath means the other's not good.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.440]   Neither's good.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.540]   One group gets justice, the other gets mercy.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.320]   Neither group gets worse than they deserve.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.480]   And Cayce points out that the different description of the two groups in verses 22 and 23 of Romans
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.600]   9, one group are vessels of wrath prepared or fitted for destruction, the other group
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.960]   are vessels of mercy which God has prepared beforehand for glory.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.800]   And Cayce is pointing out that the Greek words for "prepared" or "fitted" in the first case
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   and "prepared" in the second case are not only different verbs, but the first is passive
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.000]   and the second is active.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.560]   Let me read it again so you can hear it.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.540]   Vessels of wrath which are prepared or fitted, passive verb, for destruction, and then vessels
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.800]   of mercy which he prepared, active verb, for glory.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.360]   And he asks why?
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.200]   Why different verbs and why active and passive?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:59.660]   And my answer might be frustrating because I'm going to say I don't think we can be dogmatic
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:10.560]   about why, precisely why, Paul chose two different verbs which refer to preparing or fitting
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.300]   two different groups of vessels having similar meaning.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.400]   One for destruction, one for glory, one passive, one active.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.560]   So let me say what I think with a high level of certainty it does not mean, and then make
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.840]   a suggestion with less certainty about what it does mean.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.440]   It does not mean—so the fact that God has a passive verb in fitting folks for destruction
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:46.120]   and an active verb in fitting them for vessels of mercy, it does not mean that God is not
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:53.200]   the ultimate decisive sovereign cause of the existence of the two groups.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.500]   And the reason I say that is this.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:01.740]   The entire context of Romans 9 points in the other direction.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:09.720]   For example, verse 14, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated," God active in both.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:18.480]   Verse 18, "He has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills," God active
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.720]   in both cases.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:28.500]   Verse 21, "The potter makes out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.600]   for dishonorable use," God active in both.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.360]   So I think it's clear that the decisive actor behind the passive verb "prepared for destruction"
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   is God.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:48.040]   The point of the verse is not to say, "God, God, prepared vessels of mercy for glory,
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.360]   but some other force prepared vessels of wrath for destruction."
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.800]   Verse 18 is clear.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:01.060]   He has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.920]   God is the decisive actor behind both kinds of vessels.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:13.040]   Now that's what I'm high level of certainty, confident, that it does not mean, namely,
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.400]   that God isn't the decisive cause behind both vessels.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:27.360]   But my suggestion for why there are two different verbs, one passive, one active, is this, that
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:37.080]   Paul does indeed believe that the work of God is different in the way vessels are fitted
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.640]   for destruction and the way they are fitted for glory.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.720]   God is active and decisive in both, but not in the same way.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.840]   The very grammar of verses 22 to 23 suggests this.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:01.600]   The preparation of vessels for destruction is not God's ultimate goal.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.800]   Verse 23 begins with, "In order that there are vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.280]   in order that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy," which means
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.960]   that the work of wrath and judgment on the vessels of destruction is serving a greater
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.320]   end, namely, making known the riches of glory for the vessels of mercy.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.560]   God's ultimate aim is the revelation of glory for vessels of mercy.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:40.960]   So God's ultimate act is not preparation for destruction, but preparation for glory.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:48.840]   They are not equally ultimate and, I'm suggesting, not pursued in the same way, and that's what
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.720]   the two different verbs are pointing to.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:58.040]   The passive verb in the phrase "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction" does not point
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.080]   to God's inactivity, but to the hiddenness, the mystery of his activity.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:13.200]   God ultimately does the preparing for destruction, but he does it in complete holiness and justice
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:21.220]   and righteousness and wisdom in ways that we simply cannot fully fathom.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:29.440]   That is, he does it without in any way compromising the moral accountability of his creatures,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:38.400]   and they remain responsible for loving God over self, and he remains sovereign and holy
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.640]   over all their motives.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.120]   God is really God, and man is really responsible.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.600]   That's what I think is ultimately behind these two different verbs.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   That's very helpful.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.060]   And thanks for mentioning my new book as well, "Competing Spectacles."
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.120]   As many of you know, I never intended to become a podcast host.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.820]   I'm really just a writer.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.760]   That's my training, my experience.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.120]   I write books.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.880]   But we started this little podcast six years ago and just tried it out for a year to cover
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:16.600]   Pastor John when he lived in Knoxville, and well, here we are, some 1,400 episodes later,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.400]   and we're still podcasting and still writing books as well.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.680]   Well, of those 1,400 episodes, one of the episodes that has really garnered a lot of
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:33.180]   attention over the past year is episode 1173, "My Midlife Crisis and Counsel for Yours."
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.180]   You may remember it.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.520]   God has used that episode in a particularly powerful way, which has been evidenced in
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   really a flood of emails from men in their midlife years wanting Pastor John even to
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.520]   talk more about it, and he will.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.720]   We return to the midlife crisis theme when we return on Friday.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.360]   We'll see you then.
