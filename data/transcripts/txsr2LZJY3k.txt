[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.120]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the second chapter and the seventh verse. The seventh
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.080]   verse in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, that in the ages to come
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:30.000]   he might show forth the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.300]   Christ Jesus. Now this is the end of this mighty and magnificent statement which the
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.160]   apostle makes here and which begins at the fourth verse. Let us read it again. We can
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.000]   never read it too frequently. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.920]   he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ by
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.720]   grace he has saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:16.600]   places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show, display, manifest the
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:26.920]   exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.360]   Now I want particularly this morning to consider those last three words with you, through Christ
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.040]   Jesus. For there, of course, you have the whole gospel, and there you have the whole
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.240]   essence of the Christmas message. But let us take it in its setting, because these great
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.280]   and glorious things are always to be seen at their best in their setting and in their
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.520]   context. You will remember that we have seen that the apostle here is primarily concerned
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.240]   that these Ephesians should know in particular the exceeding greatness of God's power to
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.080]   us that believe. That is the thing he is concerned about. He has been praying for these people.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.600]   They are Christians. They have believed the gospel. They have been sealed by the Spirit.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400]   He has reminded them of these things that are true of them, and yet he does not leave
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.920]   them at that. He prays for them. He prays that the eyes of their understanding may be
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.520]   enlightened, that they may know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of the
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.280]   glory of his inheritance in the saints. And this third thing, the exceeding greatness
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.760]   of his power to us that believe. Then he goes on, you remember, to describe it. It is to
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   be seen, he says, in terms of what God did to our Lord when he brought him again from
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.800]   the dead and raised him and set him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.520]   all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.440]   this world but also in that which is to come, and hath set him over all things and hath
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.320]   put all things under his feet, and so on. And then you remember that he comes on in
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.760]   the second chapter to apply all this spiritually. It is that, that very thing, in a spiritual
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.000]   way which has happened to us. There we were, that appalling description in the first three
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.080]   verses, "Then but God," and introducing his statement of the gospel of our Lord and
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   Savior Jesus Christ. And you remember, we've been working it out, and we have seen that
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.160]   we have been quickened with Christ, we've been raised again with Christ, and we have
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.640]   been made to sit in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That is Christianity. That's
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.120]   the Christian, nothing less than that. And then he takes up here in this seventh verse,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.960]   what is ultimately God's object in doing all this? What's his purpose? He introduces
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.080]   it with this word, "that," "in order that." This is the purpose. And the purpose
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.680]   is that God might, in the ages to come, all future ages from the point at which Paul was
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.060]   writing, not only the future in the sense that it's the end of this age and the coming
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.960]   of the eternal, but from that moment that he was writing onwards, that God might display,
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.920]   might show, the exceeding riches of his grace. That's what God is concerned to do. God
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.480]   in this whole plan of salvation is vindicating himself. He is manifesting his glory.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:08.060]   Now, last Sunday morning, we saw that God does this in and through us, in his kindness
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.340]   toward us. He's displaying his glory through the church. He takes it up again, you remember,
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.900]   in the tenth verse of the next chapter, the third chapter, that the principalities and
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.620]   powers in the heavenly places might know through the church the manifold wisdom of God. And
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.860]   it is, as we were agreeing last Sunday morning, one of the most astounding things we can ever
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.620]   discover and realize about ourselves. Oh, that we were given grace to view the whole
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.020]   of our Christian life and all its attendant circumstances in the light of that conception.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.460]   Let us cease to look at ourselves and other people so much, but rather regard ourselves
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:01.060]   as being the proofs of the glory of God. He is doing it in us and through us. But not
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:12.020]   only that, God is displaying in this glory of his and the wonders of his grace, not only
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:21.980]   by what he has done and will do in us and upon us and through us, but still more, in
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:35.180]   the way in which he has done it, in his kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.540]   Now Paul can never leave that out. I fear that many of us could leave it out. Paul never
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:50.140]   leaves it out. This name, you find it everywhere, in all his epistles. Watch them, read them.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:57.020]   He keeps on repeating it, "The name of Jesus Christ." If ever a man could use the words
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.980]   and appropriate them, it was this apostle. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer's
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.860]   ear. Notice how he keeps on repeating it here all along, "In him together with Christ, in
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.460]   heavenly places, in Christ Jesus." And having used it so often, you would have thought he
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.020]   might have ended by saying that in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:29.980]   of his grace in his kindness toward us. No, no. He must say it again, "In his kindness
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.140]   toward us, through Christ Jesus."
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:50.100]   Here, I think we come to the point at which, of all points, we can really begin to measure
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.300]   the exceeding riches of God's grace. Some people would translate this in this way, that
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:04.540]   he might show the immeasurable riches, or, to use the phrase that the apostle uses, the
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:11.180]   term he uses in the next chapter, in the eighth verse, the unsearchable riches. It is here,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.340]   I say, we begin to have some conception of that. But before we come to that, let us emphasize
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:27.900]   this point. It is through Christ Jesus that we derive every benefit. Isn't it astonishing
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:34.820]   that it is still necessary to say that, and to emphasize that? But it is, because people
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:41.500]   still think of the blessings that come from God, apart from Christ Jesus. There are thousands
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.380]   of people, probably more in the world today, who are worshippers of God, as they think,
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.860]   and are anxious to be blessed by God, and believe that they are being blessed by God.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:58.340]   Yet they seem to be able to speak about all that without mentioning Christ Jesus. They
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.620]   talk about praying to God, they talk about being blessed by God, being healed by God,
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.540]   being led by God, and so on, and they do not mention the name of Jesus Christ. You see,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.780]   the apostle was aware of that danger, that is why he never misses an opportunity through
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:24.940]   Christ Jesus. The whole essence of Christianity is to say this, that God deals with men and
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:35.580]   blesses men only in and through Christ Jesus. Everything comes through him.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.620]   Now it would be a very simple matter to prove that, by endless quotations. But take our
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:49.940]   Lord's own word. "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father,
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:59.620]   but by me." Surely that ought to be enough in and of itself. We cannot pray without him.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:06.820]   We pray in his name. We pray for his name's sake. We have nothing to plead but him. How
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.540]   can we therefore approach God without him? How can anything come to us apart from him?
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:17.420]   John, you remember, in the prologue of his gospel, he puts it in exactly the same way.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:24.980]   He says, "And of his fullness," referring to the Lord Jesus Christ, "have we received."
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:33.860]   And grace for grace. It is all in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. God was
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:41.220]   in Christ, through Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. That's how he does reconcile
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:47.780]   the world. And all blessings from God come to us and flow into us through him.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:53.100]   Well now, I needn't stay with this, because those who attend here regularly will have
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.020]   been established in that particular truth beyond any question by the doctrine at the
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.940]   end of the first chapter, where the apostle teaches that every blessing really comes to
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:11.180]   us because we are incorporated into Christ. He is the head of the body, which is the Church,
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:17.140]   which is the fullness of him that filleth all in all. The Church is his body. And therefore
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.620]   we derive all our life and every blessing and every sustenance and every power. It all
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.380]   comes to us because we are members of him. He is the head. We are members in particular
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:36.740]   in the body. So that everything comes from the head, as we saw. And we enjoy, therefore,
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:45.900]   every blessing that we possess through Christ Jesus.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.660]   Can I assume, therefore, that we are all clear about this? That we are absolutely, as Paul
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:59.940]   puts it elsewhere, shut up unto Christ. The very law itself was the schoolmaster, the
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:06.820]   pedagogue to bring us to Christ, to shut us up unto Christ, to make us see that we cannot
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:14.220]   know God or derive any blessing from God except in and through Christ Jesus. He is the only
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:21.820]   channel, the one and only mediator between God and men. There it is everywhere, through
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:29.060]   Christ Jesus. But the thing to which I want to advert particularly this morning and to
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:40.700]   emphasize is rather the way in which God has done all this, through Christ Jesus. And it
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:50.460]   is here, I say, we most especially see something of the unsearchable character, the immeasurable
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:58.660]   character of the riches of God's grace. And I say that for this reason, that here we are
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:05.660]   looking at it from the Godward side. Now we have been looking at it from our side last
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.980]   Sunday morning and elsewhere, but here now we are looking at it from the Godward side.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   Let me put it to you like this. The way in which we do things is oftentimes much more
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:27.380]   significant than the thing itself which we do. And that is the whole truth about the
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:34.860]   way in which God blesses mankind through the Lord Jesus Christ. Now it would be a wonderful
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:42.220]   thing and an amazing thing and would be indicative of exceeding riches in God's grace that he
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:51.580]   should bless us at all. Let's imagine that God had blessed us as it were directly from
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:59.700]   the heavens, that he had looked upon us and that he had done certain things for us. That
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.660]   in itself would be wonderful because we deserve nothing. We have seen our character in the
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:09.900]   first three verses. Paul put it there again in a still more blunt form in that third chapter
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.460]   of the epistle to Titus, a portion of which we read just now. "There we were hateful and
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:21.220]   hating one another." There is nothing too bad that can be said about man in sin, nothing.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:28.580]   He is as vile a creature as is imaginable. But in spite of that, God has looked upon
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.500]   us and blessed us. And the very fact that he even looks upon us is indicative, I say,
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:42.380]   of unsearchable riches of grace. Ah yes, but we have something here that goes beyond that.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:48.420]   You see, it's possible for us sometimes to do a kindness for other persons without sacrificing
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:56.900]   anything ourselves at all. You may be a multimillionaire and you see some poor pauper. You don't know
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.580]   him, you've got no interest in him, and he may be an offensive person to look at even.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.660]   Well, it's a very fine and a very generous and a very noble thing for this multimillionaire
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.020]   to give that man something, especially if the man has done something against him. But
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.380]   he gives him, say, a thousand pounds. It's very generous. But it really doesn't cost
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.700]   that multimillionaire anything. He's hardly aware of the fact that he's given anything
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.440]   at all. In and of itself, it's great generosity. It's very great kindness, especially, I say,
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.580]   if that poor fellow had done something unworthy or wrong with respect to this wealthy man.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.420]   The act in and of itself is wonderful. Yes, but you see, what would greatly add to that
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:42.820]   act is, if somehow or another this man could sacrifice something and give at the same time.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:51.340]   In other words, the ultimate measure of our actions is what they cost us. Now, I don't
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:58.820]   want to detract for a moment from the intrinsic value of generosity. It's all right. But I
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:07.460]   say that when it involves personal suffering or personal need in order to help another,
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.820]   well, then it becomes infinitely greater. Well, now then, it's something like that that
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.380]   we are considering. I speak carefully because I must speak carefully. But I want to try
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:25.420]   to suggest to you that as we look at it from this aspect, that we rarely begin to have
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.900]   some kind of a measure of the immeasurable riches of God's grace. It's paradoxical,
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.500]   and yet it's all right. We never will be able to measure it. It's beyond that. It's so wonderful
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:43.300]   that men's measures are totally inadequate, and yet the Scriptures exhort us to try to
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.180]   measure it. Go on climbing. You've reached the million mark. Well, very well, go on.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.460]   There's another million beyond it, and when you get there, you'll still go on. But let's
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.620]   go on. Let's go as far as we can go. Now, that's the sort of thing the Apostle, it seems to me,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.420]   is exhorting us to do here. He prays that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened,
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:10.820]   that we may try to measure the immeasurable, and try to scale these heights, the topmost
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:19.540]   level of which can never be reached. And therefore I say we are looking at it in terms of what God
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:26.900]   has really done. This is how he's really going to display the exceeding riches of his grace,
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:36.460]   that in all those future ages, by his kindness toward us, yes, but the way he did it, through
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:45.380]   Christ Jesus. What does it mean? Well, I say that I speak out of me for this reason, that we are
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:53.100]   obviously looking into the mystery, not only the mystery of God's love, but into the mystery of
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:18:03.060]   God's being. And it's here that we cease to understand, and we walk carefully. But let us
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:09.700]   observe what the Scriptures say. If you wanted to measure the unsearchable riches, or the exceeding
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:17.060]   riches of the grace of God, in Christ Jesus, well, you can start by looking at it from the
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:29.460]   standpoint of the Father himself. Now here's the question. Can God suffer? Does God suffer?
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:37.340]   The theologians have argued on this great and important question, the passibility of God,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:50.380]   or the impassibility of God. Is God passible, or is God impassible? A tremendous subject. We'll
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:57.940]   never decide it. We can't decide it. I say it's at this point, our minds won't go. We begin to
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.300]   speculate. We don't understand, and perhaps we shouldn't. And yet it seems to me that we must
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.740]   be careful, on the other hand, that we don't ignore scriptural statements, or that we don't
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.300]   detract from them. And there are certain things which are said in the Scripture, which at Inuit,
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:20.660]   I'd like to put before you. Think about them. Meditate upon them. At Inuit, we surely must say
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:36.340]   this, that what God has done for us through Christ Jesus has cost God. Has cost God. Look at it, I say,
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:42.660]   from the standpoint of the Father. These are the terms that have used. When the fullness of the
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:52.460]   times was come, God sent forth his own Son. Made of a woman, made under the law. I'm interested in
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.780]   the sending forth. Oh, you may say that's an anthropomorphism. That's a condescension to our
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:05.100]   human inability. God is representing himself. Ah, yes, but there's a truth in the representation.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   There was a sending forth. He was in the bosom of the Father from all eternity, dwelling eternally
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:20.340]   with God, co-equal and co-eternal. God the Father sends him forth. I don't understand fully what it
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.700]   meant to God, but I do know that we are meant to think of it in these human terms, that God did
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:35.740]   send him forth. And that is where I say you ask your question. What did that mean to God the
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:45.580]   Father? It is through Christ Jesus he's going to show the unsearchable riches of his grace. It is
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.620]   through this action that all the principalities and powers in the heavenly places are going to
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:58.500]   admire the manifold wisdom of God. Not only what they see in the church, but the way God has done
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.060]   it and brought the church into being through Christ Jesus. Take some other terms. God so
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:16.620]   loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son. What a pregnant word. He gave, he gave his
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:24.940]   only Son. Now we are familiar with these terms are we not? We talk about people giving their lives
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.220]   for their country. We talk about parents giving over their children to be foreign missionaries
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:40.140]   or something. They gave, they sent them forth, they let them go. Giving, but it costs. Very well,
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.580]   I say, take this whole idea, and these are the terms that have used about God, but take another
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:57.220]   one, a still more striking one. He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.220]   How shall he not also with him freely give us all things? Look at that great word in the eighth
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:12.700]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Notice the terms. He didn't spare him. Is God passible or
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:20.820]   impassible? What does that word spare mean? God the Father knew what was necessary before the way
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:26.580]   of salvation could be made, what was necessary before he could still be just, and the justifier
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:32.380]   of him that believeth in Jesus, he knew what it would involve for the Son in suffering, and he
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:41.580]   didn't spare him, but delivered him up to all that was meant in that death, that cruel agonizing
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:50.620]   death. He knew it all. He didn't spare him. He delivered him up for us all. Now these are the
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.740]   terms with which we have to grapple as we consider this great question of the passibility of God.
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:07.540]   But there are others. He hath made him to be sin for us. Who knew no sin, that we might be made
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:16.860]   the righteousness of God in him? Now that's 2 Corinthians 5 21. God the Father hath made his
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:26.380]   own Son to be sin. Not a sinner, he has made him to be sin with which he was going to deal for us.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:35.940]   Who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him? And that of course
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.500]   points back to some of those extraordinary statements in the 53rd chapter of the book of
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:50.220]   the prophet Isaiah, "The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." Did God do that without
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:57.860]   feeling? Did God do that without suffering? Oh it's a great mystery I say, but my dear friends,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.500]   if we want really to understand what happened on that first Christmas, we must look into these
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:09.100]   things. We take it so much for granted, we take it so easily. God sent his own Son, John 3 16,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:15.940]   we all know all about it, do we? Do we know anything about it I wonder? We talk so glibly
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:25.260]   about the love of God. Have we ever considered what it means to God? He hath laid on him the
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:35.980]   iniquity of us all. It hath pleased the Father, we read again, it hath pleased the Lord to bruise
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:45.020]   him. It was his pleasure, not that it gave him pleasure, but it was his pleasure, his will,
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:54.660]   that he should bruise him. He bruised his own Son for us, and that's where you get a measure of the
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:06.460]   exceeding riches of his grace. He hath put him to grief. Verily, he, God, hath put him, his only
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:15.220]   begotten Son, to grief, in order that you and I might become his children, and in order that we
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.820]   might enjoy the exceeding riches of his grace. But you see, you don't begin to measure it, do you,
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:28.100]   until you take these three words through Christ Jesus. That's how he has done it. And there it is,
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:36.860]   at any rate, just a glimpse into it, from the standpoint of the Father. The thing itself which
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:51.780]   has taken place, as it was and is in God himself, the unsearchable riches of his grace. Who can
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:26:00.100]   measure this? Who can understand this? But that is our gospel, that God the Father has sent him
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:10.940]   forth, and has given him, and has laid upon him, the iniquity of us all, through Christ Jesus.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:18.100]   But come, let us just look at it for a moment from the standpoint of the Son, the one who came,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:25.660]   and to whom all this happened. And here again, we are involved in what Carlyle would call,
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:35.740]   infinities and immensities, which baffle us and cause the very brain to boggle. How can we measure
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.500]   this? Well, we know something like this. The Apostle teaches us, particularly in writing to
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:49.420]   the Philippians in that second chapter, we know that it meant this for the Son. "There he was in
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:27:01.260]   the eternal glory, in the bosom of the Father, co-equal, co-eternal, sharing the glory of God in
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:09.860]   all its fullness." Do you know what your salvation meant, first of all, to the Son? It meant this.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:22.420]   It meant a decision not to hold on to all the privileges and the signs of that eternal glory.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:29.420]   He counted it not robbery to be equal with God, says this authorized version, and that is what
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:34.860]   that means. You read that second chapter of Philippians, starting at verse 5 and going
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:40.380]   through to verse 11, and there you'll get it all. He counted it, he was in the form of God,
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:48.460]   though he was, he counted it not robbery to be equal with God. That means he did not regard
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:59.460]   that as a prize to be held on to at all costs. He didn't say, "Now, I'm not going to leave all this
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:05.900]   behind in order to save those people who've rebelled against you." That's what it means. "I'm
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:11.300]   anxious to help them and I'm ready to do anything I can, but I can't do this. I can't, as it were,
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:18.420]   leave aside for the time being the insignia of my glory, the marks of my eternal Godhead. I can't
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:26.460]   do that. I'm prepared to do anything, but I can't." He said the exact opposite. He thought it not
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:34.620]   robbery to be equal with God. He regarded it not as a prize to be held on to, to be clutched. He
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:42.460]   deliberately decided that he would, for the time being, lay that aside, not lay the Godhead aside.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:48.540]   He couldn't do that. He didn't lay the Godhead aside, but he did lay the signs of the Godhead
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:57.220]   aside. And then, you see, after that first initial decision, the second followed, and of necessity,
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:06.700]   he made himself of no reputation. And oh, how superior the old authorized version here is to
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.780]   the revised and others who say he emptied himself. No, he didn't empty himself. He didn't empty
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:22.140]   himself at all. He made himself, still remaining what he was, of no reputation. There is no
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:30.700]   kenosis. There is no evacuating himself of his Godhead. It's impossible. It's something much
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:38.740]   more wonderful than this. It is this, that he decided to make himself of no reputation,
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:46.740]   though he is still the eternal Son of God. He came down on earth, and he was born as a babe,
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:53.380]   and he lived as a man. He was still the same, but he made himself of no reputation. We've got
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.700]   stories, haven't we, of great kings putting on ragged clothing and going to work with their
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.180]   hands. Nobody knew them. Nobody recognized them. What had happened? The king had made himself of
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.500]   no reputation. He pretended to be an ordinary man. He didn't take with him the trappings and
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:16.140]   the insignia of his regal position, but he made himself of no reputation. And you know,
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.660]   that's the very thing that's happened in the Incarnation. That's what happened when the Son
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:27.340]   of God came down on earth to dwell amongst men. Though he remains exactly what he always was,
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:38.820]   he came as a man and took upon him the form of a servant. He took it upon him. Now, there,
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.860]   you see, we are beginning to measure all this, aren't we? That is what your salvation and mine
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:49.220]   has meant and has cost. We are interested in the exceeding riches of his grace, and we are just
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:54.620]   measuring something of it. How easy it is to sentimentalize about the babe of Bethlehem. But,
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.940]   my dear friend, go back, go back into eternity. Consider what it meant for him to come there and
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:10.260]   what it involved. How vital it is to be theological and doctrinal in all our thinking concerning him.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.420]   You think with your mind, and only then do you feel with your heart. You don't start with your
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:21.500]   heart. You start with your head, with your mind, with your understanding. The Apostle has already
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:28.020]   prayed that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened. You are Christians, he says,
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:34.180]   but have you realized what has happened, what was involved, what it has meant? Very well,
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:42.060]   he made himself of no reputation. And he had to arrive at those two decisions initially,
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:50.300]   before the incarnation could take place. And then it did take place. And so he came and was
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:32:00.660]   born of the Virgin's womb in a stable in a little place called Bethlehem. He had taken unto himself
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:09.140]   human nature. As I've said, he hadn't evacuated the Godhead out of himself in order to become men,
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:17.620]   remaining still very God of very God. He took unto himself human nature, so that he was real man as
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:32.820]   well as real God. And there we see him lying in the manger. And as I understand this statement
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:39.340]   of the Apostle, that God in all this was showing forth the exceeding riches of his grace, and even
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:44.980]   getting the principalities and powers and the angels in the heavenly places to be amazed,
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:51.580]   I imagine that when the angels looked down over the ramparts of heaven, they said something like
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:33:04.260]   this, "Who is this? So weak and helpless, child of lowly Hebrew maid." That's what they said,
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:10.460]   "Who is this?" You remember we saw last Sunday morning that these same powers,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:16.580]   looking at the glorified church and at people like ourselves with our white robes and the palms in
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:23.540]   our hands, said, "Who are these?" You see, this is how God is giving his display. "Who are these?"
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:36.180]   But there the question was, "Who is this, so weak and helpless, child of lowly Hebrew maid?" And
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:43.900]   there's one answer and one answer only. This is the King of Glory. That's the wondrous story.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:51.220]   Or listen to Charles Wesley answering the question, "Look into that manger, what are you
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:34:05.060]   seeing?" Well, this is what you see. Veiled in flesh, the Godhead, seen. Hail incarnate deity.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:12.260]   What paradoxes. There are your measures, there is the immeasurable riches of God's grace,
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:20.020]   there is this exceeding riches, this unsearchable riches, veiled in flesh,
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:29.300]   there's one end, the Godhead, seen. There's the other end. Can you measure it? Hail incarnate.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:35.300]   Yes, he's a child, he's a babe, he's moving, he's crying like every other child. He's incarnate,
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:44.780]   he's in the flesh. But deity, there's the other end, the immeasurable riches of God's grace.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:53.060]   It is through Christ Jesus, through doing things like this, that God has blessed us and shown his
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:35:00.700]   kindness toward us, and then go on and look at his life. Have you ever stopped to think and to
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:09.540]   meditate about this? What must it have been like for the eternal Son of God to live in a world
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:20.220]   like this, a world of sin? Haven't you sometimes felt a feeling of utter disgust as you've walked
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:28.300]   about the streets of this city of London and have seen certain manifestations of sin? The ugliness,
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:35.780]   the foulness, the bestiality of it all. You've felt a sense of physical revulsion,
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:41.460]   you've been revolted. And there's nothing wrong in feeling that. It is foul, it's terrible. But
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:49.500]   my dear friend, multiply that by millions, by eternity, and try to understand what it must
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:56.180]   have been like for the Son of God to have lived and dwelt in a world like this, and to have mixed
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:02.780]   with people like that, the one who is described as the friend of publicans and sinners. This is a
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.380]   part of the measure, you see, through Christ Jesus. That's where you see the unsearchable
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:17.900]   riches of his grace. He endured against himself the contradiction of sinners for 33 years. And
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:27.460]   do you know that while he was here, he never possessed a home of his own? "Foxes of herds
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:32.180]   and the birds of the air have nests," he says, "but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:39.700]   head." Have you noticed a statement like this at one point in the Gospel of John? "Every man went
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:48.940]   unto his own house." Jesus went into the Mount of Olives. He never had a house. He never owned a
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:56.180]   home. The one through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made,
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:04.380]   hadn't a place where to lay his head, hadn't a home of his own, through Christ Jesus. And
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:10.340]   then think of all the buffeting and all the plotting against him, the spitting in his face,
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:16.380]   the arguing, the attempts to trip him. These are all facts, my friends, and we must concentrate
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.540]   on the facts. We must come right back to them. We are not saved by a philosophy, not by some
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:28.480]   beautiful idea, not by some marvellous fantasy or some poetic conception. No, no, these are
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:36.660]   literal, hard, solid facts. He came down to earth and he went through all this for us men and for
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:50.860]   our salvation. It is all, I say, literal fact. And then in the garden, secretly, sweating great
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:38:03.460]   drops of blood, the unsearchable riches of his grace through Christ Jesus. There he is,
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:16.740]   sweating in an agony, great drops, as it were, blood. And then the cross, the pain and the
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:30.100]   suffering. We may not know, we cannot tell what pains he had to bear, but we know that he was
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:41.620]   there again in a great agony. He cried out saying, "I thirst." And then towering over it all, the
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:57.980]   sense of desertion, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" The exceeding riches of his grace
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:09.100]   in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus, bearing the crushing load of the world's sin,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:22.900]   bearing the wrath of his Holy Father, being made sin. That's the measure. And while he was
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:31.340]   enduring it all, he was still the eternal Son of God, as well as Son of Man. Such suffering
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:40.860]   we cannot imagine, but he suffered enough to bear the full penalty of sin. It is through Christ
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:48.580]   Jesus the blessings come to us. And he dies, and they take him, and they buried him in a grave.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:56.140]   Well, you remember Peter put this again in his address to certain unbelieving Jews in a perfect
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:05.020]   manner when he said, "You put to death the author of life. You put to death the prince of life,"
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:11.260]   which means the author of life. You see, there again you've got the absolute measure. Death,
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:19.020]   the author of life. The author of life was put to death. There is the measure of the exceeding
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:25.780]   riches of God's grace. They put him to death, they took down his body, and they buried him in a grave,
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:31.620]   and rolled that stone over the grave. That's the measure of it all. And then God raised him,
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:37.060]   as Paul tells us here, and again brought him forth from amongst the dead, and took him into
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:45.700]   heaven, and has glorified him, and has exalted him. There's the whole movement, the span of it all,
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:56.940]   the measure of the exceeding riches of his grace. Now, the apostle's point is that God has done all
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:08.540]   that in order that he might show forth to all future ages his own glory and greatness, and
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:16.220]   especially the exceeding riches of his grace. And let me emphasize as I close, to show it not only
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:22.980]   to men, it is indeed the theme of men. But not only of men, it is the thing that amazes the
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:29.940]   angels. That's why that hymn which we sang just now was perfectly right, "Angels from the realms
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:41.100]   of glory, wing your flight through all the earth." The angels that sang in the morning of creation,
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:52.420]   sang again on the morning of his birth. Never had heaven seen such a thing as this, never had heaven
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:42:00.460]   seen such a theme as this, as this astounding thing, that babe that was born, whom they knew
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:08.060]   as the Lord, the only begotten Son of the Father, the one through whom all was created. There he is
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:16.660]   lying as a helpless babe. It's not surprising that they sang and hailed Messiah's birth. And
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:22.540]   they still go on surprising because the Apostle Peter tells us in his first epistle and in the
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:30.940]   first chapter and in the twelfth verse, he says this, that not only had the prophets under the
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:38.060]   old dispensation who prophesied of these things, namely the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.100]   that should follow, he says the prophets didn't quite understand it. As they wrote about it,
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.900]   they were given the word, the message, and they faithfully wrote it. They didn't understand it,
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:53.540]   they didn't know what manner of time all this was going to happen. But not only were they surprised
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:43:02.940]   and astonished, according to Peter, this is also true, which things, he says, the angels desire to
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:10.900]   look into. What an amazing statement. These things are the sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:17.060]   should follow, the whole movement of the incarnation, the life, the atoning death, the burial, the
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:24.620]   resurrection, the glorification. Which things, says Peter, the angels desire to look into. Now,
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:33.820]   he uses a very interesting word there. That word desire, it means a very intense and a very strong
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:39.460]   desire. Indeed it includes a further idea which is this, that they stoop down in order to look
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:44.340]   into it. Do you remember the accounts which we have of the resurrection? We are told that Peter,
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.980]   and Peter and John, says another evangelist, they went to the grave, having been given the report
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.220]   by the women that the Lord had risen, they went to the grave, and we are told that they stooped
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:00.620]   down in order to look into the grave. That's the very word that Peter uses here. Which things,
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:08.380]   the angels are stooping down to look at. The incarnation of the Son, the death of the author
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:19.420]   of life, the burial of the Creator. It is the most astonishing thing. The angels are amazed,
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:28.340]   and they worship and they praise God as they see this manifestation, this display, this showing of
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:38.220]   the exceeding riches of God's grace. Not only the rebels, miserable sinners, such as you and I,
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:44.340]   should be quickened with a new spiritual life, and raised again, and made alive unto God,
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:50.020]   and to be glorified, and to spend our eternity in his presence. That's amazing, and they are
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:58.900]   marveling at that. But it's when they consider the way that God has done it, that even the
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:07.580]   expression of angels fails and becomes inadequate. This is something surpassing everything.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:18.140]   That God should have so loved the world, as to give, even to the shameful, cruel death of the
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:28.500]   cross, his only begotten Son. That whosoever believeth in him, without any works at all,
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:38.580]   should not perish, but have everlasting life. That in the ages to come, he should show the
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:53.140]   exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus. Amen.
