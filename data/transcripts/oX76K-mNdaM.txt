[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   It looks like this particular agent has been killing people for 5,000 years,
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.120]   four or 5,000 years in Western Eurasia, and in fact is killing like a scarily large fraction
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.840]   of the population. Like as a quantitative person, which I am reading this literature,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.960]   I think people are embarrassed by the implication. The implication is that a third, a quarter,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   half of deaths in this entire period are from this. And people are just, it's so unbelievable,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.160]   so ridiculous that such a high proportion of people over such a long period of time are dying
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.000]   from this one agent that people don't even say it. They just publish one paper after the other,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.280]   publishing more sequences, and they just don't think about the implications of such a high rate
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.200]   of death. When the first large number of DNA sequences from people who lived five and six and
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.880]   4,000 years ago in the steppe north of the Black and Caspian Seas and in Europe were being published
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.760]   about in 2015, this group in Denmark, led by S.K. Willerslev and Kristian Kristiansen and colleagues,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   looked at their DNA, and they discovered in their sequence from the 100 or so humans they sequenced
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.280]   that there was also pathogen DNA. And in five to 10% of the random people they sequenced around
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.720]   four or 5,000 years ago, there was Yersinia pestis, which is the agent of the Black Death.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.680]   But actually, without the plasmid that contributes to bubonic plague that's required for flea rat
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.320]   transmission, so it must have been, for example, pneumonic plague with the aerosolized transmission
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.640]   or something. But five to 10% of random deaths means that actually the percent of people who
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.120]   were dying must have been even higher, because they weren't detecting everything that was there.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.960]   So the implication seems to be this one agent that we happen to be able to detect
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.400]   is killing a very large fraction of people in Western Eurasia over this period. So what's
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.440]   the implication of that? One thing is that maybe it seems to be coming from steppe rodents,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.120]   probably. And so maybe the people on the steppe are somewhat more, I mean, they're still dying,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.880]   but somewhat more protected than it spreads into farming Europe, maybe 5,000 years ago,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.280]   which is when we start to see it. And maybe this results in disorganization of the population,
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.080]   giving such high rate of death. And maybe it creates a type of situation that the Europeans
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.920]   encountered when they got to the Americas, where societies were disrupted. So in the last few years
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.080]   we had COVID-19 that killed a half percent of the world population or something like that,
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.240]   and it was so disruptive. So this thing is killing a third of people or half of people,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.320]   randomly killing people with cultural knowledge, randomly ripping into structures like in,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.880]   I don't know, was it Montezuma died, or one of his parents resulting in civil wars in the Inca
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.800]   when the Europeans encountered them, just disrupting the cultures that were there.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.400]   Maybe this would have created a situation where there was disruption in the old ways of life,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.120]   and maybe combined with other things, or even just by itself, could have created an opportunity for
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.040]   people to move in from elsewhere, even though they were not as densely spread. Because the
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.680]   big observation we haven't talked about, and it's something that we as an ancient DNA community have
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.080]   been looking into again and again now and keep making progress on, is that about 5,000 to 4,500
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.520]   years ago in Europe, there's a radical transformation in the ancestry of Europeans. An example of this
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.200]   is what happens in Britain. So about 4,500 years ago, the farmers who are there, they arrived there
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.680]   6,000 years ago, they build Stonehenge, the last big stones of Stonehenge go up 4,500 years ago,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.720]   and then within a hundred years, 90% of them are gone. And they're replaced by migrants from the
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.000]   continent bearing majority ancestry from the steppe north of the Black and Caspian Seas. This
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.880]   is one place where we know what happened very well, but we see it all over Europe. We see it in Spain,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.720]   we see it in Portugal, we see it in the Netherlands, we see it in Germany, we see it in Czechia, we see
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   it in Italy, we see it in Switzerland, we see it everywhere. This wave of people from the East
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:05.760]   arrives, and it displaces these successful, impressive, densely packed farmers with new
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   people who have this ancestry from the East, who are not as focused on farming, although some of
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.840]   them are, as the people who came before. So a paper just came out a few weeks ago in Scandinavia
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.320]   looking at these tombs from about 5,000 years ago of farmers who were just on the verge of
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.120]   encountering people from the steppe, and a huge fraction of them have Black Death when they die.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.320]   They're buried in tombs, even higher than 5 or 10%. So this whole pedigree with many, many
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.880]   generations, so it's not all at the same time, just like the parents, generation to generations,
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.960]   a very large fraction, like well more than 10%, have Black Death and have Yersinia infection.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:53.600]   This is so crazy. So just for the audience, if you're keeping tally, this one bacteria,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.080]   Yersinia pestis, is responsible. I mean, we learned in grade school that it's responsible
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.680]   for killing a third of Europeans, more recently causing the Black Death, right? And there's even
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.120]   theories that this helped with the Industrial Revolution because it drove wages up in Britain,
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.640]   and because of higher wages, they had to make machines, and dot, dot, dot. Robert Allen,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.680]   the economist, has a theory about this. So potentially caused the Industrial Revolution.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.240]   That one's more tended.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.600]   It causes inflation. So it ends, I mean, in the Medieval, one creates a lot of inflation,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.200]   and the serfs, as I understand it, were sort of on fixed wages, and so they had to be paid more.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.040]   It basically inflated out their sort of signorial responsibilities.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.800]   Yeah. So that's one of my things. The other is during the Bronze Age, it allows the steppe
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   people basically to replace the existing hunter-gatherer or farmer population in Europe.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   Like literally all of Europe allows a population from the Eastern steppes to
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.240]   replace the existing people who build the Stonehenge, doing other things in Europe.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.200]   And the Kyle Harper's book talks about this, where the Plague of Justinian, I think the final one
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.880]   that killed off the empire, was also Yersinia Festus.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   Definitely. That's documented with kinetics.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.840]   The fall of the Roman Empire, the entire, like twice, the sort of, or at least once,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.360]   the replacement of the population in Europe, and the second time, you know,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.520]   basically like modernity happened afterwards. It's crazy. One disease, and potentially the
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.800]   New World as well, in terms of, I don't know how many people, what percentage of the deaths in the
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.440]   New World were...
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.760]   It's estimated to be not the primary pathogen.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.320]   Okay.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.320]   But who knows? And in any case, I mean, there's others too, right? So some of the other plagues
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   in the Roman Empire are definitely not Yersinia.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.360]   So that's crazy that not only disease,
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.160]   but this one in particular has had this big a role in human history.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:46.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
